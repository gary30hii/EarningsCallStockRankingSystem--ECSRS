At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Realty Income Fourth Quarter and Year-end 2020 Operating Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the call over to Andrew Crum, Associate Director at Reality income. You may begin, sir.\nAndrew Crum: Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's fourth quarter and year-end 2020 operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Christie Kelly, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer.  During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in these forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company's Form 10-K. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy.\nSumit Roy: Thanks, Andrew. Welcome, everyone. As we remain in a remote work environment to promote the safety of our employees and community, I continue to be impressed by the resiliency and talent of our team to drive our business forward through the current pandemic. Additionally, I remain appreciative of the support resiliency of our clients and partners who continue to perform under challenging circumstances.  On the personal front, we were excited to welcome Christie Kelly to our management team in January as Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; and in February, Michele Bechor joined our team as Executive Vice President, Chief Legal Officer, General Counsel and Secretary.  Mike Pfeiffer, who served as Executive Vice President, Chief Officer, General Counsel and Secretary, will retire after over 30 years of service. Mike will remain serving our company through June 2021 as Chief Administrative Officer and will continue leading our team members as well as assisting Christie and Michelle through their transition at Realty Income until his well-deserved retirement.  Words cannot fully reflect Mike's many contributions to our company for over 3 decades, and I'm so immensely grateful for his partnership with me throughout the year.  Moving on to financial matters, including a summary of the quarter and year. During the fourth quarter, we invested over $1 billion in high-quality real estate, including $467 million in the U.K., bringing us to over $2.3 billion invested during 2020, approximately $921 million of which was invested in the U.K. Investments during the year were largely concentrated in the grocery and home improvement industries, both of which continue to thrive during the current economic environment.  We maintained low leverage and ample liquidity throughout the year while enhancing our financial flexibility. Highlights include the establishment of a $1 billion commercial paper program, our successful debut public issuance of sterling denominated unsecured notes and record low coupon rates for 5 years and 12-year dollar-denominated bonds in the REIT sector. We have also been active in the equity capital markets to accretively fund our acquisition pipeline. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we raised approximately $605 million of equity, primarily through our ATM program. And in January, we raised an additional $670 million of equity through an overnight offering.  Accordingly, our balance sheet is well positioned to address what continues to be an active investment pipeline. To that end, we are introducing 2021 acquisitions guidance of over $3.25 billion, as we are well positioned to continue the momentum we experienced at the close of last year and in January. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we invested approximately $1 billion in 70 properties located in 22 states and the U.K. at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.4% with a weighted average lease term of 13.4 years.  On a total revenue basis, approximately 68% of total acquisitions during the quarter were from investment-grade rated tenants. 71% of the revenue is generated from retail tenants. These assets are leased to 31 different tenants in 19 industries. Of the $1 billion invested during the quarter, $541 million was invested domestically in 59 properties at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.2% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.1 years.  During the quarter, $467 million was invested internationally in 11 properties located in the U.K. at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.7% and with a weighted average lease term of 11.7 years. During 2020, we invested over $2.3 billion in 244 properties located in 30 states in the U.K. at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.9% and with a weighted average lease term of 13.2 years.  On a revenue basis, 61% of 2020 acquisitions are from investment-grade rated tenants. 87% of the revenues are generated from retail and 13% are from industrial assets. These assets are leased to 56 different tenants in 26 industries, 2 of the most significant industries represented our grocery and home improvement. Of the $2.3 billion invested during 2020, nearly $1.4 billion was invested domestically in 220 properties at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.8% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.9 years. And approximately $921 million was invested internationally in 24 properties located in the U.K. at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.1% and with a weighted average lease term of 10.8 years.  Transaction flow remains healthy as we sourced approximately $17.1 billion in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we sourced approximately $63.6 billion in potential transaction opportunities. The most we have ever reviewed in a given year. Of these opportunities, $42.4 billion were domestic opportunities and $21.2 billion were international opportunities. Investment-grade opportunities represented 50% of the volumes sourced during the year. Of the $63.6 billion sourced, 56% were portfolios and 44%, approximately, $28.2 billion were one-off assets.  Of the $1 billion in total acquisitions closed in the fourth quarter, 66% were one-off transactions. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy during the quarter, averaging approximately 130 basis points.  Moving to dispositions. During the quarter, we sold 60 properties for net proceeds of $77.5 million, realizing an unlevered IRR of 8.7%. This brings us to 125 properties sold during 2020 for $261 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.8%, and we realized an unlevered IRR of 11.6%. Our portfolio remains well diversified by clients, industry, geography and property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At year-end, our properties were leased to approximately 600 clients in 51 separate industries located in 49 states, Puerto Rico and the U.K.  Approximately 84% of rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at approximately 11% of rental revenue. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 5.7% of rental revenue. Convenience stores remains our largest industry at 11.9% of rental revenue. Within our overall retail portfolio, approximately 95% of our rent comes from tenants with a service, nondiscretionary and/or low price point component to that business. We continue to believe these characteristics allow our tenants to operate in a variety of economic environments and to compete more effectively with e-commerce.  These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate, where the vast majority of recent U.S. retailer bankruptcies have been in industries that do not possess these characteristics. We remain constructive on the credit quality of the portfolio with over half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment-grade rated tenants. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 97.9% at year-end. During the fourth quarter, we released 77 properties, recapturing 100.3% of the expiring rents.  During 2020, we re-leased 314 properties, recapturing 100% of the expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold over 3,500 properties with leases expiring, recapturing over 100% of rent on those properties that were released. In light of COVID-19, rent collection across our portfolio has remained stable over recent months. During the fourth quarter, we collected 93.6% of contractual rent due and further improvement in rent collection percentages is primarily dependent upon improvements in the theater industry, which I will touch on shortly.  We collected 100% of contractual rent for the fourth quarter from investment-grade rated tenants, which further validates the importance of our high-quality real estate portfolio, least to large, well-capitalized clients. While we have not historically prioritized investment-grade rated tenants as a primary objective. During periods of economic uncertainty, high-grade credit tenants tend to provide more reliable streams of income as the last several quarters have exemplified.  Our Top 4 industries, convenience stores, grocery stores, drug stores and dollar stores, each sell essential goods and represent over 37% of rental revenue, and we have received nearly all of the contractual rent due to us from tenants in these industries since the pandemic began. Uncollected rent continues to be primarily in the theater industry, representing approximately 80% of uncollected rent in December.  As the theater industry remains challenged, I would like to update the investment community on our latest view. The industry represents 5.6% of our contractual base. While we do expect the industry to downsize in the future, we continue to believe it will remain a viable industry in a post pandemic environment, especially for high budget blockbuster movies.  You might recall that the U.S. box office reached an all-time high as recent as 2018, and 2019 produced the highest grossing worldwide film of all times in Avengers: Endgame. We continue to believe, particularly for blockbuster movies that a theatrical release will be the preferred distribution channel for studios going forward, given the superior economics supported to them versus streaming platforms.  That said, we do acknowledge that the industry is changing and that there likely will be a rationalization of theaters in a post pandemic reality. Under this scenario, underperforming theaters may not survive. We continue to maintain a full reserve, the outstanding receivable balance for 37 of our 77 total theater assets and continue to recognize revenue on a cash basis for these 37 assets.  During the fourth quarter, we established a full reserve for 1 additional theater asset, and we disposed off one theater asset previously on cash accounting. To be clear, we do not expect to lose the entirety of rent associated with these properties longer term, even in the event of potential closures. As of year-end, the total allowance for these 37 theaters totaled $23.7 million, including $1.8 million of which is a straight-line rent receivable reserve and thus has no AFFO impact.  Moving on. Our same-store rental revenue decreased 3.2% during the quarter and 1.7% year-to-date. Our reported same-store growth includes deferred rent and unpaid rent that we have deemed to be collectible over the existing lease term, but it excludes rent where collectibility is deemed less than probable. The decrease in same-store rental revenue is primarily driven by reserves we recognized in the theater industry and to a lesser extent, the health and fitness industry.  Now to provide additional detail on our financial results for the quarter, I would like to hand it off to Christie.\nChristie Kelly: Thank you, Sumit, and I'm honored to have joined Realty Income as CFO.. Having joined the Board in 2019, I have experienced firsthand the talent of our Realty Income team, together with the exciting growth opportunities for our business.  I'm looking forward to working together with our teams to deliver our strategic objectives and realization of dreams and aspirations for all at Realty Income with Sumit and our Board of Directors. I also look forward to engaging with our investment community over time. We are grateful for the support of all of our loyal shareholders who have invested in Realty Income for over 26 years as a public company and for our future.  I would now like to provide a general overview of our recent financial results, starting with the balance sheet. We have continued to maintain our conservative capital structure and remain one of only a handful of REITs with at least 2 A ratings. During the quarter, we completed our debut public offering of Sterling denominated senior unsecured totes, issuing GBP 400 million due 2030 for an effective annual yield to maturity of 1.71%.  We also issued 725 million of senior unsecured notes in December through a dual tranche offering of 5-year and 12-year notes. Achieving record low U.S. dollar coupon rates in the REIT sector for each of those tenors. Additionally, we raised approximately $655 million of equity during the quarter, primarily through our ATM program. And in January 2021, we raised approximately $670 million through an overnight equity offering, which we earmarked to prefund an active investment pipeline to start the year.  We ended the year with low leverage and strong coverage metrics with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 5.3x or 5.2x on a pro forma basis, adjusting for the annualized impact of acquisitions and dispositions during the quarter. And our fixed charge coverage ratio remained strong at 5.1x. We ended the year with full availability under our $3 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility. No borrowings outstanding on our $1 billion commercial paper program and over $824 million of cash on hand.  In January, we completed the early redemption of all $950 million, 3.25 notes due 2022, which was done to reduce our near-term refinancing risk and take advantage of attractive borrowing rates in the fixed income market. Looking forward, our overall debt maturity schedule remains in excellent shape with only $44 million of debt maturities through year-end 2021, excluding commercial paper borrowings.  Now moving on to our income statement. AFFO per share during the quarter was $0.84 and $3.39 per the year on a fully diluted basis, representing annual growth of 2.1%. For 2020, our AFFO per share was negatively impacted by non-straight-line rent reserves of $44.1 million, which represents approximately $0.13 per share of dilution, over half of which is attributed to the theater industry.  Now moving on to guidance. As we introduced our initial 2021 earnings estimate, we acknowledge that while some uncertainty related to the theater industry remains together with the backdrop of the pandemic, our confidence in providing guidance is supported by the overall health and stability of our portfolio combined with the acquisition pipeline.  To that end, our 2021 AFFO per share guidance of $3.44 to $3.49, represents approximately 1.5% to 3% growth over 2020. Moving on to dividends. In December, we increased the dividend for the 109th time in our company's history. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of approximately 4.4%. And we are proud to be 1 of only 3 REITs in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat index for having increased our dividend every year for the last 25 consecutive years.  And now I'd like to hand our call back over to Sumit.\nSumit Roy: Thank you, Christie. As we reflect on 2020, we stand behind the overall resiliency of our portfolio. The relentless efforts of our team to add shareholder value and the outlook for our business over the long term. The momentum in our investment pipeline are ample sources of liquidity, and our size and scale positions us favorably to capitalize on near-term growth opportunities around the globe.  At this time, I would like to open it up for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from Vikram Malhotra with Morgan Stanley.\nVikram Malhotra: Maybe just -- congratulations on the new role. Maybe just to start off with the occupancy degradation, as you outlined it. I'm just wondering if you can talk about two things pertaining to that. One, sort of plans to backfill some of that or recapture some of that occupancy loss. And then as we think about kind of '21, what sort of embedded in terms of potential other areas where you might lose occupancy?\nSumit Roy: Those are great questions, Vikram. And thank you. So at the end of the third quarter, we were right at 98.6%. And the question was asked, where do you think you're going to end the year up? And we had said that it was going to be right around 98%. And the fact that we came at 97.9% was fairly accurate. And what we saw coming was the NPC bankruptcy filing. As you might recall, we have approximately 150 assets with NPC, most of which happens to be the Pizza Hut. And then we have 19 assets that are Wendy's that's also run by NPC.  We were expecting 66 assets to be rejected through the bankruptcy process. And that was the reason why we had guided the market to a 98 -- approximately a 98% occupancy number. We were -- and those 66 assets did come back to us during the fourth quarter, which is the largest driver of this 97.9%. You will see that the net increase in vacant assets from third quarter to fourth quarter was circa 45 assets. So despite the fact that we got 66 assets back, we were able to resolve a lot more assets than we had originally thought because these assets are very well located, Vikram, and we were able to attract either QSRs that wanted to take some of these assets. And we feel very good about being able to resolve these assets fairly quickly.  The other point I'll make is most of these Pizza Huts with NPC had less than 2 years remaining on their lease term. And so our asset management team had already begun the process of trying to figure out alternatives. Knowing fully well that these were the assets that would come back, even if it were to have not filed bankruptcy.  So we feel pretty good about being able to resolve these assets. And as you can see from the resolution, we have the most number of resolutions in the fourth quarter. This was a record quarter for us. And so it's a testament to the team that we have in place, Ben and TJ, who drive that particular process for us, continue to do an absolutely amazing job despite the backdrop of the pandemic. And we are very hopeful that we will climb right back up above 98%.  Look, we have frictional vacancy, and we've always suggested that to the group that because we want to have the ability to reposition some of these assets, we are always going to be in this 98% -- circa 98% occupancy rate because we do want to reposition some of these assets, which does take us time, and that will continue to be what we target going forward.\nVikram Malhotra: That makes sense. And then just one, Christie, for you. The overall AFFO growth, I know there's some dilution or maybe just some headwinds near term. You obviously prefunded some of this. Can you just give us a rough sense of the AFFO growth sort of in the first half year-over-year versus the second half of the year?\nChristie Kelly: I think, Vikram, that in terms of where we're going to see AFFO growth, I think you can expect that to be a bit similar to historical norms outside of probably the second quarter of last year where we pulled back on acquisitions a bit. But nothing out of the ordinary.\nOperator: Your next question is from Haendal St. Juste with Mizuho.\nHaendel St. Juste: Can you talk a bit about decline in cash yields in the fourth quarter. Through the first three quarters of last year, the average cash yield were closer to 6%, decline to 5% in the fourth quarter. So you could just talk about what drove that decline. And you also mentioned that 61% of the 4Q volume was one-off transaction. So how should we think about the balance between one-offs in portfolios near term? And what type of pricing differential are you seeing there?\nSumit Roy: Yes. Good question, Haendel. As you pointed out, the lower cap rate was largely driven by the mix of assets that we purchased here in the U.S. If you look at the prepared remarks, I suggested that 29% of what we purchased here in the U.S. were industrial assets, single-tenant industrial assets. These were very well placed assets with clients that who are executing on their omnichannel strategy had lease terms that were north of 10 years, some 15-year leases, good growth in markets that we wanted to enhance our exposure and with rents that were right around market rents. And so as you know, the industrial assets tend to be trading a lot more aggressively. And as such, that certainly had a bit of a downdraft on our cap rate, but the fact that we were able to do 5.2% for the U.S. assets was largely driven by that.\nHaendel St. Juste: Okay. And then maybe a bit of color on the guide for this year, $3.25 billion. I'm curious how we should think about the yields on that front. And as part of your conversation with potential sellers, I'm curious, if in light of potential 1031 repeal, would you consider issuing units to sellers and how that might be perceived or any initial sense of -- or have you discussed that with potential sellers and what feedback you might be getting on that?\nSumit Roy: Sure. Again, good questions, Haendel. Look, we came out in early January with what our pipeline looked for the first quarter. And you might recall we had about $800 million -- slightly above $800 million that we had disclosed to the market at that time that we had in our pipeline, and we were 12 days into the year. So I don't think it should have come as a surprise that we had an incredibly healthy pipeline developed coming out of the fourth quarter. And if you look at what we were able to achieve in the fourth quarter of $1 billion, we had a tremendous amount of momentum that sort of carried forward into the first quarter and that has continued. It is also a testament to the amount of sourcing that we are able to do, the new swim lanes that we have created for ourselves to continue to grow the portfolio. And I think it's a testament to the strategy that we put in place a couple of years ago to be able to now post numbers that seem very large relative to what we have come out with in years past. But that's precisely the path that we wanted to go down.  You mentioned what is the expected cap rates? I think you should expected cap rates to be similar to what we achieved in 2020. And given the mix of portfolio, the optimal portfolio allocation that we have sort of highlighted to the market, it's really going to be a function of which particular portfolio or assets closed within a quarter as to whether the cap rates are going to come out.  If it's going to have a slightly more industrial plan to it, it's going to be lower cap rates. If it's going to be more retail, it's going to have a slightly higher cap rate. Having said that, even retail, especially though those types of retail that are deemed essential, portfolios are now trading in the mid-4s. And so the pricing environment has gotten a lot more aggressive. But thankfully, we have the cost of capital, and we were still able to generate 160 basis points of spread for the entire year, which is north of our historical spread. So we feel very good about the quality of assets we are buying and how we are reshaping our portfolio along the lines of what we had shared with the market in the third quarter, et cetera.  So really, the cap rate is going to be a function of the composition of assets that we drive within a given quarter.  The last question you had talked about was 1031. And what is the impact or our ability to issue OP units. Well, it's not new for us. We have done this in the past. We've bought assets from retail shareholders who wanted to buy -- wanted to take OP units as consideration for proceeds, and we were able to satisfy that. So could I see that momentum picking up potentially to defer having to pay taxes?  Absolutely. And we are very well equipped to take advantage of that. And use our equity as currency to provide that to potential sellers.  But having said all of that, 1031 is not a big part of our business, even on the disposition side. As you can see, most of the assets that we sell tend to be vacant assets, and that doesn't lend itself to the 1031 market. It's primarily developers or tenants who want to own their own assets that tend to play in that particular area. And on the occupied side, a lot of the transactions we did in 2020 were existing tenants exercising their option to purchase. And that's the reason why we were able to generate very good proceeds and very good overall returns. And the opportunistic sales tend to be an area where perhaps we run into some 1031 buyers. But that, I would say, is about 25% of the sellers that we interact with.  So for us, I think the -- on the disposition side is going to be fairly muted. On the acquisition side, I think not having 1031 be as aggressive, especially on the smaller boxes like QSRs and drug stores, et cetera. We could see cap rates increase because of the lack of 1031 buyers. And so that could potentially accrue to our benefit, especially when we are engaging in these one-off asset acquisitions.\nHaendel St. Juste: Welcome, Christie. I look forward to meeting you in person.\nChristie Kelly: Thank you so much, Haendel. Me too.\nOperator: You our next question is from Greg McGinniss with Scotia Bank.\nGreg McGinniss: And Christie starting with you. First, welcome. Secondly, if you can just dig into guidance real quick. Is the acquisition guidance of at least $3.25 billion, which is an interesting way to say that you're probably confident you're going to get more than that. But how should we be thinking about what gets you to the top or bottom end of the AFFO per share guidance range, given that acquisition expectation.\nSumit Roy: I know the question was geared towards Christie and Christie, please jump in. But why don't I take that a little bit? And then I'll hand it off to Christie, if that's okay, Greg.  For us, we wanted to make sure that we came out with a range that represented the facts on the ground today. And we wanted to make sure that the range was conservative enough where even if the situation were not to improve, and it was to be, as we have experienced early on in the year in January and December of last year that this is the range that we feel very comfortable with.  What I'm suggesting is that there could be a fair amount of upside to the range that we have shared. And it's largely a function of what's going to happen to the theater industry at large, but also, to a smaller extent, to the health and fitness industry. And there, we feel very confident that the theater business is going to improve, especially with the vaccination having taken hold and every day, we see more news about Pfizer and Moderna and now potentially J&J being on the approved list, that the acceleration of getting to a point where we have herd immunity is very realistic.  And I've seen base case models that suggest that as early as end of June, we could get close to having herd immunity. The other data point that I would point to, Greg, is what we have seen in China. And over the Chinese -- the Lunar New Year, we can -- they had record ticket sales. And in fact, one of the movies that was shown had almost $50 million more in sales than the record that had been set by Avengers: Endgame here in the U.S. and in Canada, and their opening we can't. And so all of these facts sort of lead us to believe that there is a possibility that there is a fair amount of upside on the assumptions that we have shown in our model. And that could that could help get us to the top end of the range. And if a lot of other things fall into place, potentially, we could do even better.  But we can't go out with that expectation. When you lay out all the various different scenarios. You come up with what's the probability weighted outcome. And that's what we have shared with the market. But there are things that could play in our favor, and it really is a function of how you think about the theater industry and what you think the recovery is going to look like. And we've shared with you at nauseam some of the assumptions that we have drawn in terms of taking 37 of our 77 assets and viewing it on a cash accounting basis and how that percolates through the base model. If your view shifts, to say, that's perhaps a bit too conservative then there is good upside. And that's what we are super excited about.  There are certainly other levers for us to play, like you correctly pointed out, the acquisition market is something we are super excited about. And part of it is intentional and part of it is a function of more and more operators and clients that we want to do business with, wanting to engage in sale-leaseback transactions. And so that too could act as a potential tailwind. And look, we've come out with numbers. You've seen our history about the early estimates that we come out with and what we are able to achieve during the year. But not saying that -- but there too, there could be some tailwinds. So there's acquisition fronts. There are assumptions that we have made about the theater business and the health and fitness business. There are assumptions we've made about how quickly we could get to a point where things are starting to normalize, et cetera.  And all of those have room and capacity for potentially surprising on the upside. So we feel pretty good. And I'll hand it back to Christie, if there's anything else you would like to add.\nChristie Kelly: Thank you, Sumit. And Greg, thanks so much for the question. But I absolutely echo everything that Sumit has said. We spent, as you can imagine in the backdrop of 2020, a good bit of time really thinking about the guidance and being very thoughtful about how we went out in terms of our range of AFFO per share.  And as Sumit said, there are a number of levers that we have to the upside in terms of sale-leaseback transactions, a bit more on the acquisition side and also really looking at primarily the theater industry.  And so there is positive momentum. And in light of that, we do feel, as Sumit said, very good about where we are right now and the momentum that we have in the business.\nGreg McGinniss: Okay. Great. For my second question, Sumit, inflation is increasingly top of conversation with investors. Could you perhaps provide some context on real TCPI-based lease escalator exposure, and how the company is positioned to provide growing returns relative to peers in an inflationary environment?\nSumit Roy: Sure. So I would say about 20%. It's probably a little bit bigger than that. Of our leases have CPI adjustments. And -- but a lot of these have a floor in the ceiling associated with them. So yes, a rising CPI environment, we have some level of protection, but there does tend to be -- especially here in the U.S., there tends to be a floor in the ceiling associated with it.  For us, the -- we've encountered this problem before. What happens in an inflationary environment? The fact that we have leases that are net lease in nature. We are less sort of less susceptible to an environment where inflation expectation and actual inflation goes up because so much of the cost, either insurance, property, taxes, et cetera, are paid by our tenants. And so from that perspective, we feel pretty good. We started to see the 10-year treasury go up in anticipation of expected inflation going up. But thankfully, so far, our spreads have come down as well. And our all-in cost in the tenure has gone up slightly, but not dramatically. We can still issue tenure -- in today's environment, we think right around the 2122 ZIP code.  And that is still relative to what we've been able to do in the past, a very good all-in costs on the 10-year financing. So we feel pretty good about that. Some of this is now offset by what we are seeing in the U.K. as well as in Europe, where interest rates continue to be low, inflation expectations are very much contained. And so there, our all-in cost of financing continues to be super exciting. And so the fact that we have created all of these different alternatives also helps us shield us somewhat from inflation expectations arising in particular geographies and so we feel pretty good about that as well. And the fact that we have long-term leases also is a benefit.  Look, at some point, if the inflation expectations are going up, and it is largely translating to better GDP growth, et cetera, that should translate to better fundamentals for our tenants. And so not so much this year, we only have about 1.7% of our leases expiring. But in future years, that should start to reflect on higher market rents, et cetera. And so especially in 2022, 2023, we have a bit more of a expiration with regards to our leases, I could see us marking to market some of our leases during renewal time. And so I think from all of those perspectives, we feel pretty good.  One of the questions that often comes up, okay, if the interest rate environment continues to go up, it's going to impact your cost of capital, and that is absolutely true. But what we have found in prior cycles is that cap rates tend to follow suit as well. And there is definitely a lag, but it does sort of follow and then it allows us to continue to maintain the spreads that we have. And in certain situations, even enhance our spreads if the cap rate moves faster than our cost of capital. So we feel like we are very well positioned as a company. And based on some of the investments we've made and some of the areas that we have focused on, we feel like we are very well situated to handle an interest rate environment that increases an inflationary expectation environment that increases.\nOperator: Next question is from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs.\nCaitlin Burrows: Welcome to the -- Christie to the earnings call. Maybe just following up on the guidance question. One of the pieces you guys showed was income taxes and that they're expected to increase in 2021. And I think that's related to U.K. activity. But could you give us some more detail on what's driving this and how we should think about it increasing in the future? And is it a function of U.K. activity?\nChristie Kelly: It is, Caitlin. And I think that you can expect modest increases as we continue to expand our U.K. presence.\nCaitlin Burrows: Okay. So if we look at like the year-over-year increase from 2020, I guess, should we just see that if you're making a similar amount of U.K. investment dollars that the income tax dollars may go up at, I don't know, kind of similar type rate?\nChristie Kelly: Similarly, yes.\nCaitlin Burrows: Okay. And then when we think about the deferrals that Realty Income put in place in 2020, I guess, could you give some detail on when you expect to receive those and to the extent that any have already been built, kind of how that collection is going. And similarly, when you'll start to know if the reserves you were taking were conservative, right? Or sort of the opposite of conservative would be aggressive.\nChristie Kelly: Sounds good, Caitlin. I think, first of all, what I can say is that as it relates to the deferrals that we've been taking. Essentially, when we look at the overall deferrals, we're really looking at a short-term payback and within 18 months. And as it relates to collections and the like, we are experiencing collections even before the deferrals are coming due. So we've been having some positive traction on that. All that being said, we've got 2021 in front of us.\nCaitlin Burrows: Got it. Okay. So when we think about what's built into guidance and the reserves that you guys took last year, obviously, you gave the guidance range. You gave thinking that it would be accurate, but is it right to think that as we go through 2021, we'll start to maybe even early in the year, get some clarity on whether or not the reserves you took in 2020 were the right amount?\nChristie Kelly: Yes, yes. And we go through, Caitlin, you may already know this, but a very rigorous review on our receivables positioning and it's cross functional. It involves finance, it involves legal, our asset management group and research. And so in terms of the actions that we've taken, we feel very solid about the reserve position. And as we look forward, our collections have been consistent and steady. Where we are right now in the fourth quarter, we've got close to 94% of collections. And really, when you take a look at the uncollected rent in our company, it's really a story about theaters. 80% of the uncollected rent is focused on the theater business, which is 5.6%, as you know, of our contractual rent base. And the remaining of the story is really around health and fitness, which is primarily the remaining 16% of uncollected rent. And we did incur some collections on the health and fitness business. As Sumit said and we've talked about, we still have theaters in front of us. But there've been really positive momentum, and we view that potentially could be an upside for our business going forward.\nOperator: Your next question is from Rob Stevenson with Janney.\nRobert Stevenson: Just a question on the -- your comments on the movie theater business. Given that, would you be an incremental buyer of movie theaters in any type of scale going forward here?\nSumit Roy: Yes. So Rob, I think this question was asked last quarter as well. Look, we like to reach other business. But 1 of the lessons learned through this process is that should this represent at least when the pandemic started 6% of our overall portfolio. And I think what we have concluded through this process is that this business should survive but there will be some level of real estate rationalization. And we are very happy to have put together this portfolio largely through sale leasebacks with the operators themselves. And so feel very good about our current portfolio. But the idea long-term is to continue to dwindle our exposure to this particular industry to something that is closer to a 3% ZIP code. So I think that answers your question, Rob. We feel like, over time, we need to get it down to about 3% of our overall portfolio.\nRobert Stevenson: Okay. Helpful. And then how are you thinking about non-U.K. European acquisitions at this point and given what's going on over there?\nSumit Roy: Non-European U.K. acquisition. So how am I thinking about the U.K. acquisition?\nRobert Stevenson: Non-U.K., European. So the continent. So Germany, Scandinavia, outside of the U.K., are you guys -- should we expect that you guys -- you see the U.K. as a launching point to make bigger acquisitions and expand throughout Europe? Is it only going to wind up being U.K. at this point for the near term? How are you thinking about that in the context of the last 12 to 18 months in your experience there? Will we be expecting to see another line in the acquisitions at some point in 2021 or early 2022 in addition to the U.S. and the U.K., continental Europe acquisitions.\nSumit Roy: We've always said that U.K. was our first step into a European strategy, a western European strategy, and that continues to be the path that we are embarking upon, Rob.  We are very well-established in the U.K., some of the numbers that we have posted, I believe, is a testament to that statement. We -- I'm delighted to also share with you that we've hired another full-time person at Negara in our U.K. office. Who has a lot of experience doing acquisitions and has a lot of relationships, et cetera, in the Western Europe -- European markets. And so the goal is to continue to look for transactions and not be constrained by geography, but look for the right transactions. And there are markets that we have identified in Western Europe that we would like to be able to grow into. But it's largely a function of do we have the right operators willing to transact at the right prices, et cetera, et cetera. So are we open to acquiring in Western Europe? The answer is categorical yes. But do I expect to see something happen in Spain? I don't have a timeline for that or something in France or Italy or Germany, I don't have a timeline for you. It's largely going to be a function, what's available and who we can get to work with and whether they fit into our overall target client list.\nRobert Stevenson: And the financing options in the continent over there, are they as attractive to you at this point as the U.K. if you were to buy something, would you finance it in local currency?\nSumit Roy: Absolutely. I mean, that's been our goal is try to minimize our exchange rate risk as much as we can, and we would follow a similar pattern to what we did in the U.K. where we did our debut, Sterling offering and prior to that, we had done a private placement, raising capital in U.K. denominated pounds. And that will continue to be how we finance our transactions. And that's where it becomes super exciting, Rob. I mean, you can do a 10-year paper in euro-denominated debt at 65, 70 basis points. Yes, cap rates are a lot more aggressive. But when you sort of factor in the cost of financing for somebody who's A-, A3 rated, it suddenly starts to make a lot of sense. And I think continuing to create alternative sources of capital, continuing to look at additional paths to growing our business is something that our platform allows us to do. And it's 1 that we are excited about, and we'll continue to push on.\nOperator: Next question is from Brent Dilts with UBS.\nBrent Dilts: So most of my stuff has been asked, but I did want to ask something. Your grocery sector exposures increased quite a bit in recent years. And I know that was intentional, but it's up to nearly 10% of rents. So maybe could you talk about how you're viewing that sector longer term, just given the wider adoption of online grocery delivery during the pandemic? I mean do you think -- like what we've seen so far is it's mostly local delivery from stores, but do you think there's any risk that disconnects from the customer's local store over time and maybe the grocery store becomes a little bit more challenged from an e commerce perspective?\nSumit Roy: Yes. Brent, I don't know if you go to a local grocery even in this environment, you still find them fairly full. And I'm not trying to be facetious here. It is deemed an essential retail and they have continued to perform. Having said that, the most important thing that we are trying to focus on is the fact that the operators that we want to do business with, they have an omnichannel strategy. If you look at the U.K. grocers that we have partnered with, they dominate the click and collect market, and they dominate the delivery services. And so most of the partners that we have. And if you sort of unpack the 10%, and it's not quite 10%, but it's getting there of our exposure. You'll find that all of the operators that we have done business with are -- substantially all of the operators that we've done business with tend to have this omnichannel strategy, very well-established or in the process of having it very well established. They have the [indiscernible] and the balance sheet to do so.  And I do think that, that is going to be the future of this particular industry, which is why we got very comfortable but it's not just the industry, but it's the operators that we have targeted within these industries that we have done business with. And they will be not only surviving but thriving in the new environment where potentially, there is going to be more click and collect or delivery services. So we feel very good about our specific exposure within this industry. I don't know if this was a question or not as to whether -- are we sort of getting up against our limits with 10%. I would say, no. Our investment policy allows us to go as high as 15%. And for certain industries, we can always go back to the Board and request exceptions. But of course, we have to put forth our thesis as to why it makes sense. But this is an industry we feel very comfortable with, Brent.\nBrent Dilts: Okay. Yes, that makes sense. I was just curious what your longer-term thoughts were. And then just 1 other quick one. I don't know if you've really got much to say about it. But the power grid issues in Texas recently, you have decent exposure to that market. Anything we should expect there longer term? Or is it just a blip?\nSumit Roy: Well, it's -- I don't want to underplay what's happening in Texas. But thankfully, as far as our exposure in Texas is concerned, again, that's the advantage of having a triple net business is that it's largely being handled by the operators. And thankfully, the disruption was fairly short term. And so most of these businesses are going to be able to come back.  Yes, they may have some issues with product not making it through this blip, as you put it. But I don't see this as being a major issue for the specific clients that we have exposure to in Texas.\nOperator: Your next question is from Spenser Allaway with Green Street.\nSpenser Allaway: Just looking to total commitments for your development pipeline. I realize it's a small portion of your overall capital deployment, but it is fairly elevated versus historical norms. So I was just wondering if you could provide some color on how you're thinking about this bucket? Should we expect it to remain elevated? And what kind of stabilized yields are you underwriting?\nSumit Roy: Yes. Spenser, that's a great question. There's a reason why we have that sheet in our supplemental, and we want to lay it out as clearly as possible. This is another one of the avenues us to continue to gain exposure to certain clients and do it at a cap rate that is north of what you would be able to transact in the open market. And so it is about $160 million of commitment, $100 million of which is not funded yet. But if you look at the breakup, you will see that it's largely driven by 2 forward commitments we have on the non-retail side of the business. And so what that allows us to do is, again, enter into these contracts in a particular asset type that is trading super aggressively and be able to transact and get assets maybe 40, 50, 60 basis points north of where these assets would be trading have they been available today. And so I think that is part of the advantage of doing this. And this is, again, using our credit, using our scale and size to be able to get some of these assets at higher cap rates than what we would on the open market.  The other side of this is repositioning. I think it was Vikram, who had asked about, hey, how are you thinking about these assets from NPC. We have a history of being able to reposition some of our assets and be able to really capture and enhance our rent from the same exact location by simply repositioning these assets. And that is something we've been doing for a few years. They tend to be smaller dollar amounts.  But once again, we've given you that detail in the supplemental. And that will continue to be a bigger and bigger portion of our business. And I think as you've seen, the velocity of our lease terminations, et cetera, will only increase. And this part of our business, which we have seasoned over many years, will start to play a bigger, bigger role and will certainly, we hope, be a value-enhancing part of our business model.  And so I would love to see this business continue to increase within the parameters of what I just shared with you and help us create another source of value creation for the overall business.\nOperator: Your next question is from Wes Golladay with Baird.\nWesley Golladay: Just got a quick question on dispositions. How is demand for the noncore assets for the tenants that are impacted by COVID? I know you were able to sell a theater this quarter. Do you know if that will stay a theater?\nSumit Roy: Not sure. But I think, Wes, we've talked about this again, some of these theaters are located in prime locations. And we've already shared with you that, look, we don't think that the footprint of the theater business, pre-pandemic is going to be exactly the same post pandemic. So there will be some level of rationalization. But the good news is there is a fair amount of demand for last mile distribution, and there's much more of a focus on development of multifamily, given some of the trends that we are seeing in some of these markets. So it is quite possible that these assets, given that they sit on potentially 10, 12, even 15 acres of land, could be repositioned to a higher and better use. But that question, Wes, I think, is going to be very specific to the particular location and where that particular theta falls in the performance rankings. And if it tends to be in the top 2 quartile, I would say that, yes, the likelihood of it remaining at theater is high. But if not, I could easily see it being repositioned.  Perhaps not easily but certainly repositioned.\nWesley Golladay: Okay. And then could you -- did you -- I don't know if you shared it already, but how much of the ABR is for tenants on cash accounting and what is the percentage collected from that tenant base? And are those mostly related outside of the theaters, mostly related to tenants that are in bankruptcy now?\nSumit Roy: Christie, do you want to take this one?\nChristie Kelly: We have -- when we take a look, Wes, at our overall collections. I think I had mentioned this before that our collections are stable at 94%. 80% around collected rent is really as a result of the theater industry. And the remaining is really in regard to the health and fitness.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Todd Stender with Wells Fargo.\nTodd Stender: Sumit, sorry if you already covered this. But I heard you quote cap rates on a few levels. But when we look at your $3 billion-plus acquisitions, we would assume some good-sized portfolios incorporated in that. Can you speak to portfolio premiums right now versus one-off deals? And maybe if you can bifurcate if there are premiums between retail and industrial?\nSumit Roy: Yes. That's a very good question, Todd. What we had seen in -- even as late last year that there was a portfolio discount, not a portfolio premium. But there has -- we have seen a couple of portfolios come to market that have traded very expensively. And so I'm not quite sure where this trend is going to go, Todd. But -- and I think I mentioned this already that even some industries and some tenants that we had seen pre-pandemic are now trading at levels as a portfolio, 40, 50 basis points lower.  So it's tough to tell. I don't think it is a point that could be made across all industries and all operators. I do think that in most industries and especially the higher-yielding industries. If there's a portfolio transaction, you will tend to see a discount, not a premium. But in certain industries and the industries that are in favor today, we are certainly seeing a little bit of tightening. With regards to $3.25 billion, we are not underwriting to very large portfolio transactions. That is not part of our overall forecast, Todd. So if that were to happen, I think that would be above and beyond the numbers that we have shared with you. And so that, too, could be a potential tailwind for our business. As you might know, there are several public sale-leaseback transactions in the market, none of which are reflected in the numbers that we have shared.  With respect to cap rates, it is -- it has compressed. And it has compressed even over the last 5 months, 4 months. So whether it's retail here in the U.K. industrial, as you know, it's probably steady but still fairly aggressive cap rates. It's -- all has tended to become a lot more expensive today than it was 6 months ago.  In the U.K., thankfully, the cap rate market is a bit more stable. I wouldn't go so far as to say that it's compressing. But it's funny, we tend to do certain transactions where we are the only ones who are engaging in conversations and then we will find 1 or 2 other potential buyers start to come in on subsequent transactions.  So this is an interesting acquisitions environment that we find ourselves in right now. And -- but we feel very good. Again, the advantages that we have, we feel like we'll be able to get more than our share of transactions done, and we will continue to do it as spreads that will be very favorable and will help us drive earnings growth.\nChristie Kelly: Wes, I wanted to circle back on your question. Because I had the theater numbers in my mind. But you were asking about cash accounting. And I just wanted to let you know that right now, we have almost 50 clients on a cash basis. And just to give you some color, it's a little over $5.5 million of monthly rent exposure, for which over half of that is associated with the theater industry. Let me know if that helps.\nSumit Roy: Okay. Todd, any other questions?\nTodd Stender: That's it for me.\nOperator: Your next question is from John Massocca with Ladenburg Tallman.\nJohn Massocca: First off, welcome to the earnings call, Christie. Thank you. I know we're getting a little long on the call here, so I'll keep it to 1 question. Has there been any change with regards to rent collection quarter-to-date in 1Q '21 versus, say, 4Q '20. I mean essentially, can you provide any color on any of these troubled industries or non-paying tenants? Are any of them starting to maybe pay that hadn't been paying in December, November, October?\nSumit Roy: Yes. I could probably help with that a little bit. I mean, if we take a look at year-to-date, the January recollection was relatively consistent with what we've been seeing in the past months towards that 94% range. And essentially, the theater industry is still the majority at approximately 80%. And we did see some pickup as it relates to health and fitness. And it's a little early for February. But overall, as we said at the start of the call, it's consistent and steady.\nJohn Massocca: Okay. But the improvement you've seen so far this quarter has been largely on the health and fitness side rather than the theaters?\nChristie Kelly: Like that, yes. But I would like to say too that theaters are paying.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Katie McConnell with Citi.\nMichael Bilerman: It's Michael Bilerman. Can you hear me?\nSumit Roy: Yes. We can hear you, Mike. This is what happens when I'm in the office. Katie is in Philadelphia. We have an associated home. Creates that lot merging that doesn't work too well sometimes. I was wondering if you can provide some perspective. Obviously, when you switch over from banking, you went to Duke as the CFO. And then with CBRE, you sit on Park Hotels, Kite Realty, Tiers Board. You came out to Realty Income board last year. Net lease and what Realty Income is very different from those other companies in terms of the type of business in terms of creating growth with this longer duration net leases really where the competitive advantage is the cost of capital. And obviously, the relationships that the company has. But the secret to this company is being able to access well-priced capital and finding the deals. Just talk about sort of your perspectives and how you think the company should be capitalized?  How you think about capital raising relative to your prior experiences? Certainly, Michael. It's great. Great to hear your voice again, and I look forward to seeing you in person. But I wasn't at CBRE. I was at JLL.\nMichael Bilerman: Just a broker. Close enough.\nChristie Kelly: But in terms of overall thoughts, Michael, you've known me for a long time. And I think that you really -- and obviously understand the triple-net lease business. Now really being competitive and leveraging our scale and thoughtfulness on the capital markets side is really, I think, what you seen from us historically, what you saw from us at the beginning of the year and what you can expect from us going into the future.  As Sumit mentioned, we're excited about what we're seeing in the U.K. in terms of the debt markets and what we can execute at. And should something come to fruition on the continent. We have a lot -- we have some very favorable aspects, we believe, on the continent from a debt perspective as well. And when we take a look at capitalization, I mean, you can expect us to protect our balance sheet and really be focused on that net debt-to-EBITDA of 5.5% -- 5.5x, as we mentioned, and really going forward in that regard. And sitting back, you mentioned some of those other businesses. I mean, as you know, Realty Income is just a fantastic business with a great team, and I'm really excited about joining the team.  We have a long runway ahead of us, great growth potential. And as Sumit's been mentioning some really exciting things to continue to add value to our clients.\nMichael Bilerman: As you think about sort of cash flow growth, you talked a little bit about on the call of some of the industries that are having some issues and how that could sway guidance. But part of the weaker growth is the prefunding of a lot of the transaction volumes given the sheer amount of equity that you raised in the fourth quarter and earlier this year, how should we think about your cadence on equity because it is depressing current earnings should -- was that like a rebalance for '21? Or should we expect an acceleration of growth as we move through the year and into 2022 solely focused on the transaction side of the equation?\nSumit Roy: Not necessarily, Michael. I mean we were just taking advantage of the market at that point in time, and it was really an opportunistic play given the acquisition pipeline that we had in front of us. So you can expect us to still be managing our debt-to-equity equation thoughtfully in keeping with our A rating, but not being overly aggressive, if you will, to cause dilution.\nOperator: Your next question is from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America.\nJoshua Barber: Just wanted to see what the latest was on the 7-Eleven portfolio that's in the market and kind of your current feeling about if you would consider adding to your 7-Eleven exposure?\nSumit Roy: Joshua, I'll take that question. So we don't talk about specific transactions. You also can see that 7-Eleven is a top 10 tenant of ours. It's a client that we have done repeat business with. We help do their first sale-leaseback in 2016 and did subsequently 4 other sale leasebacks directly with them. So clearly, it's an operator. It's -- that we really like. It's in an industry that we like, and especially the standing that 7-Eleven has within the [indiscernible] store business, we really like their positioning. And so then the question becomes okay, what about the 11% industry exposures that you have to convenience store business. Is that a factor that could potentially curbed our ability to do more? And I think I've answered this question before, we have a limit of 15%, and we can always get exceptions in the event we can make the case that a particular industry is one that we are very favorable, we implying towards and would like to see it increase. And this is one of those industries that we would feel very comfortable in increasing our allocation to. But again, we have to be very specific that it's industry increase in allocation, but with particular clients in mind and 7-Eleven would that will be falling in that bucket.\nOperator: Your next question is from Linda Tsai with Jefferies.\nLinda Tsai: In terms of acquisitions, what type of competition do you run into on larger portfolio deals? And who would be willing to take on tenant concentration to get some of these larger deals done?\nSumit Roy: Are you asking us about whether we would be willing to take the tenant concentration? Or is this a general question, Linda?\nLinda Tsai: It's just more of a general question around competition. When you're looking at these larger portfolio deals, and maybe who some of the competitors are out there that would be willing to take on concentration?\nSumit Roy: Sure. So that's 1 of the things that we talked about, Linda, is the fact that we do have the size and the scale to absorb large portfolios. Now the way I would define large portfolios is $1 billion plus. Most peers would run into concentration questions doing half that size. Especially if they already have a preexisting exposure to that particular client. But we find ourselves in the enviable position of being able to continue to increase the allocation for a given client, and it's largely a testament to the size of our overall business and balance sheet. But clearly, when you start talking $5 billion, $6 billion, those are types of transactions that don't come very often. And when they do, outside of us, I don't know if there is any other public net lease buyer that could potentially entertain absorbing that sort of size.  Then in terms of who are the alternative buyers of this. It's largely driven by what is available on the financing side of the equation. And ABS has become a preferred mechanism of financing these large scale transactions, especially with highly rated operators. And then once those boxes are checked, you can pretty much assume some of the private equity folks getting involved and being super excited about playing in that size because they can put capital to work, and lever up the portfolio to, call it, 85%, 90% and be able to get very -- enhance their cash-on-cash yield. So that's the group that would be the traditional competition for very large sale-leaseback opportunities with highly rated operators.  But when interest rate starts to move in the direction that it has, then that does start to put pressure on some of these players because the cost of financing on that 80%, 90% leverage starts to creep up. So it really is going to have to be coupled with what we see in the financing market to help define who the potential competition could be.\nLinda Tsai: Got it. And then just in terms of the cash basis tenants, what percentage did you collect from the cash basis tenants in 4Q and in 3Q?\nSumit Roy: Yes. I'll let Christie answer that.\nChristie Kelly: We had a couple of million. Linda, I believe. Okay.\nLinda Tsai: And then just for the 40 theaters that aren't on a cash basis, it sounds like we should assume they're paying some level of rent. For the 40, are they concentrated under 1 banner versus another? In your disclosure, you show 40 Regal and 32 AMC?\nSumit Roy: Yes. I can answer that. Yes, about 41 of these assets, when we did our internal analysis, we deemed them to be in this top quartile. And that's how we came up with the 41. But when we talked about us getting some rent from both AMC as well as Regal, especially in the month of December. It was across the entire portfolio. So even those assets, those 37 assets that we have on cash accounting, they paid us rent. Not 100%. But they paid us some rent for the month of December, and that's really the upside for us going forward.\nOperator: At this time, this concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income's conference call. I will now turn the conference over to Sumit Roy for concluding remarks.\nSumit Roy: So thank you, everyone, for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you at the upcoming virtual conferences. Take care. Bye-bye.\nChristie Kelly: Thanks, everybody.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Christie Kelly",
            "content": "Thank you, Sumit, and I'm honored to have joined Realty Income as CFO.. Having joined the Board in 2019, I have experienced firsthand the talent of our Realty Income team, together with the exciting growth opportunities for our business.  I'm looking forward to working together with our teams to deliver our strategic objectives and realization of dreams and aspirations for all at Realty Income with Sumit and our Board of Directors. I also look forward to engaging with our investment community over time. We are grateful for the support of all of our loyal shareholders who have invested in Realty Income for over 26 years as a public company and for our future.  I would now like to provide a general overview of our recent financial results, starting with the balance sheet. We have continued to maintain our conservative capital structure and remain one of only a handful of REITs with at least 2 A ratings. During the quarter, we completed our debut public offering of Sterling denominated senior unsecured totes, issuing GBP 400 million due 2030 for an effective annual yield to maturity of 1.71%.  We also issued 725 million of senior unsecured notes in December through a dual tranche offering of 5-year and 12-year notes. Achieving record low U.S. dollar coupon rates in the REIT sector for each of those tenors. Additionally, we raised approximately $655 million of equity during the quarter, primarily through our ATM program. And in January 2021, we raised approximately $670 million through an overnight equity offering, which we earmarked to prefund an active investment pipeline to start the year.  We ended the year with low leverage and strong coverage metrics with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 5.3x or 5.2x on a pro forma basis, adjusting for the annualized impact of acquisitions and dispositions during the quarter. And our fixed charge coverage ratio remained strong at 5.1x. We ended the year with full availability under our $3 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility. No borrowings outstanding on our $1 billion commercial paper program and over $824 million of cash on hand.  In January, we completed the early redemption of all $950 million, 3.25 notes due 2022, which was done to reduce our near-term refinancing risk and take advantage of attractive borrowing rates in the fixed income market. Looking forward, our overall debt maturity schedule remains in excellent shape with only $44 million of debt maturities through year-end 2021, excluding commercial paper borrowings.  Now moving on to our income statement. AFFO per share during the quarter was $0.84 and $3.39 per the year on a fully diluted basis, representing annual growth of 2.1%. For 2020, our AFFO per share was negatively impacted by non-straight-line rent reserves of $44.1 million, which represents approximately $0.13 per share of dilution, over half of which is attributed to the theater industry.  Now moving on to guidance. As we introduced our initial 2021 earnings estimate, we acknowledge that while some uncertainty related to the theater industry remains together with the backdrop of the pandemic, our confidence in providing guidance is supported by the overall health and stability of our portfolio combined with the acquisition pipeline.  To that end, our 2021 AFFO per share guidance of $3.44 to $3.49, represents approximately 1.5% to 3% growth over 2020. Moving on to dividends. In December, we increased the dividend for the 109th time in our company's history. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of approximately 4.4%. And we are proud to be 1 of only 3 REITs in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat index for having increased our dividend every year for the last 25 consecutive years.  And now I'd like to hand our call back over to Sumit. I think, Vikram, that in terms of where we're going to see AFFO growth, I think you can expect that to be a bit similar to historical norms outside of probably the second quarter of last year where we pulled back on acquisitions a bit. But nothing out of the ordinary. Thank you so much, Haendel. Me too. Thank you, Sumit. And Greg, thanks so much for the question. But I absolutely echo everything that Sumit has said. We spent, as you can imagine in the backdrop of 2020, a good bit of time really thinking about the guidance and being very thoughtful about how we went out in terms of our range of AFFO per share.  And as Sumit said, there are a number of levers that we have to the upside in terms of sale-leaseback transactions, a bit more on the acquisition side and also really looking at primarily the theater industry.  And so there is positive momentum. And in light of that, we do feel, as Sumit said, very good about where we are right now and the momentum that we have in the business. It is, Caitlin. And I think that you can expect modest increases as we continue to expand our U.K. presence. Similarly, yes. Sounds good, Caitlin. I think, first of all, what I can say is that as it relates to the deferrals that we've been taking. Essentially, when we look at the overall deferrals, we're really looking at a short-term payback and within 18 months. And as it relates to collections and the like, we are experiencing collections even before the deferrals are coming due. So we've been having some positive traction on that. All that being said, we've got 2021 in front of us. Yes, yes. And we go through, Caitlin, you may already know this, but a very rigorous review on our receivables positioning and it's cross functional. It involves finance, it involves legal, our asset management group and research. And so in terms of the actions that we've taken, we feel very solid about the reserve position. And as we look forward, our collections have been consistent and steady. Where we are right now in the fourth quarter, we've got close to 94% of collections. And really, when you take a look at the uncollected rent in our company, it's really a story about theaters. 80% of the uncollected rent is focused on the theater business, which is 5.6%, as you know, of our contractual rent base. And the remaining of the story is really around health and fitness, which is primarily the remaining 16% of uncollected rent. And we did incur some collections on the health and fitness business. As Sumit said and we've talked about, we still have theaters in front of us. But there've been really positive momentum, and we view that potentially could be an upside for our business going forward. We have -- when we take a look, Wes, at our overall collections. I think I had mentioned this before that our collections are stable at 94%. 80% around collected rent is really as a result of the theater industry. And the remaining is really in regard to the health and fitness. Wes, I wanted to circle back on your question. Because I had the theater numbers in my mind. But you were asking about cash accounting. And I just wanted to let you know that right now, we have almost 50 clients on a cash basis. And just to give you some color, it's a little over $5.5 million of monthly rent exposure, for which over half of that is associated with the theater industry. Let me know if that helps. Like that, yes. But I would like to say too that theaters are paying. But in terms of overall thoughts, Michael, you've known me for a long time. And I think that you really -- and obviously understand the triple-net lease business. Now really being competitive and leveraging our scale and thoughtfulness on the capital markets side is really, I think, what you seen from us historically, what you saw from us at the beginning of the year and what you can expect from us going into the future.  As Sumit mentioned, we're excited about what we're seeing in the U.K. in terms of the debt markets and what we can execute at. And should something come to fruition on the continent. We have a lot -- we have some very favorable aspects, we believe, on the continent from a debt perspective as well. And when we take a look at capitalization, I mean, you can expect us to protect our balance sheet and really be focused on that net debt-to-EBITDA of 5.5% -- 5.5x, as we mentioned, and really going forward in that regard. And sitting back, you mentioned some of those other businesses. I mean, as you know, Realty Income is just a fantastic business with a great team, and I'm really excited about joining the team.  We have a long runway ahead of us, great growth potential. And as Sumit's been mentioning some really exciting things to continue to add value to our clients. We had a couple of million. Linda, I believe. Okay. Thanks, everybody."

            "name": "Sumit Roy",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrew. Welcome, everyone. As we remain in a remote work environment to promote the safety of our employees and community, I continue to be impressed by the resiliency and talent of our team to drive our business forward through the current pandemic. Additionally, I remain appreciative of the support resiliency of our clients and partners who continue to perform under challenging circumstances.  On the personal front, we were excited to welcome Christie Kelly to our management team in January as Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; and in February, Michele Bechor joined our team as Executive Vice President, Chief Legal Officer, General Counsel and Secretary.  Mike Pfeiffer, who served as Executive Vice President, Chief Officer, General Counsel and Secretary, will retire after over 30 years of service. Mike will remain serving our company through June 2021 as Chief Administrative Officer and will continue leading our team members as well as assisting Christie and Michelle through their transition at Realty Income until his well-deserved retirement.  Words cannot fully reflect Mike's many contributions to our company for over 3 decades, and I'm so immensely grateful for his partnership with me throughout the year.  Moving on to financial matters, including a summary of the quarter and year. During the fourth quarter, we invested over $1 billion in high-quality real estate, including $467 million in the U.K., bringing us to over $2.3 billion invested during 2020, approximately $921 million of which was invested in the U.K. Investments during the year were largely concentrated in the grocery and home improvement industries, both of which continue to thrive during the current economic environment.  We maintained low leverage and ample liquidity throughout the year while enhancing our financial flexibility. Highlights include the establishment of a $1 billion commercial paper program, our successful debut public issuance of sterling denominated unsecured notes and record low coupon rates for 5 years and 12-year dollar-denominated bonds in the REIT sector. We have also been active in the equity capital markets to accretively fund our acquisition pipeline. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we raised approximately $605 million of equity, primarily through our ATM program. And in January, we raised an additional $670 million of equity through an overnight offering.  Accordingly, our balance sheet is well positioned to address what continues to be an active investment pipeline. To that end, we are introducing 2021 acquisitions guidance of over $3.25 billion, as we are well positioned to continue the momentum we experienced at the close of last year and in January. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we invested approximately $1 billion in 70 properties located in 22 states and the U.K. at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.4% with a weighted average lease term of 13.4 years.  On a total revenue basis, approximately 68% of total acquisitions during the quarter were from investment-grade rated tenants. 71% of the revenue is generated from retail tenants. These assets are leased to 31 different tenants in 19 industries. Of the $1 billion invested during the quarter, $541 million was invested domestically in 59 properties at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.2% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.1 years.  During the quarter, $467 million was invested internationally in 11 properties located in the U.K. at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.7% and with a weighted average lease term of 11.7 years. During 2020, we invested over $2.3 billion in 244 properties located in 30 states in the U.K. at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.9% and with a weighted average lease term of 13.2 years.  On a revenue basis, 61% of 2020 acquisitions are from investment-grade rated tenants. 87% of the revenues are generated from retail and 13% are from industrial assets. These assets are leased to 56 different tenants in 26 industries, 2 of the most significant industries represented our grocery and home improvement. Of the $2.3 billion invested during 2020, nearly $1.4 billion was invested domestically in 220 properties at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.8% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.9 years. And approximately $921 million was invested internationally in 24 properties located in the U.K. at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.1% and with a weighted average lease term of 10.8 years.  Transaction flow remains healthy as we sourced approximately $17.1 billion in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we sourced approximately $63.6 billion in potential transaction opportunities. The most we have ever reviewed in a given year. Of these opportunities, $42.4 billion were domestic opportunities and $21.2 billion were international opportunities. Investment-grade opportunities represented 50% of the volumes sourced during the year. Of the $63.6 billion sourced, 56% were portfolios and 44%, approximately, $28.2 billion were one-off assets.  Of the $1 billion in total acquisitions closed in the fourth quarter, 66% were one-off transactions. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy during the quarter, averaging approximately 130 basis points.  Moving to dispositions. During the quarter, we sold 60 properties for net proceeds of $77.5 million, realizing an unlevered IRR of 8.7%. This brings us to 125 properties sold during 2020 for $261 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.8%, and we realized an unlevered IRR of 11.6%. Our portfolio remains well diversified by clients, industry, geography and property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At year-end, our properties were leased to approximately 600 clients in 51 separate industries located in 49 states, Puerto Rico and the U.K.  Approximately 84% of rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at approximately 11% of rental revenue. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 5.7% of rental revenue. Convenience stores remains our largest industry at 11.9% of rental revenue. Within our overall retail portfolio, approximately 95% of our rent comes from tenants with a service, nondiscretionary and/or low price point component to that business. We continue to believe these characteristics allow our tenants to operate in a variety of economic environments and to compete more effectively with e-commerce.  These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate, where the vast majority of recent U.S. retailer bankruptcies have been in industries that do not possess these characteristics. We remain constructive on the credit quality of the portfolio with over half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment-grade rated tenants. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 97.9% at year-end. During the fourth quarter, we released 77 properties, recapturing 100.3% of the expiring rents.  During 2020, we re-leased 314 properties, recapturing 100% of the expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold over 3,500 properties with leases expiring, recapturing over 100% of rent on those properties that were released. In light of COVID-19, rent collection across our portfolio has remained stable over recent months. During the fourth quarter, we collected 93.6% of contractual rent due and further improvement in rent collection percentages is primarily dependent upon improvements in the theater industry, which I will touch on shortly.  We collected 100% of contractual rent for the fourth quarter from investment-grade rated tenants, which further validates the importance of our high-quality real estate portfolio, least to large, well-capitalized clients. While we have not historically prioritized investment-grade rated tenants as a primary objective. During periods of economic uncertainty, high-grade credit tenants tend to provide more reliable streams of income as the last several quarters have exemplified.  Our Top 4 industries, convenience stores, grocery stores, drug stores and dollar stores, each sell essential goods and represent over 37% of rental revenue, and we have received nearly all of the contractual rent due to us from tenants in these industries since the pandemic began. Uncollected rent continues to be primarily in the theater industry, representing approximately 80% of uncollected rent in December.  As the theater industry remains challenged, I would like to update the investment community on our latest view. The industry represents 5.6% of our contractual base. While we do expect the industry to downsize in the future, we continue to believe it will remain a viable industry in a post pandemic environment, especially for high budget blockbuster movies.  You might recall that the U.S. box office reached an all-time high as recent as 2018, and 2019 produced the highest grossing worldwide film of all times in Avengers: Endgame. We continue to believe, particularly for blockbuster movies that a theatrical release will be the preferred distribution channel for studios going forward, given the superior economics supported to them versus streaming platforms.  That said, we do acknowledge that the industry is changing and that there likely will be a rationalization of theaters in a post pandemic reality. Under this scenario, underperforming theaters may not survive. We continue to maintain a full reserve, the outstanding receivable balance for 37 of our 77 total theater assets and continue to recognize revenue on a cash basis for these 37 assets.  During the fourth quarter, we established a full reserve for 1 additional theater asset, and we disposed off one theater asset previously on cash accounting. To be clear, we do not expect to lose the entirety of rent associated with these properties longer term, even in the event of potential closures. As of year-end, the total allowance for these 37 theaters totaled $23.7 million, including $1.8 million of which is a straight-line rent receivable reserve and thus has no AFFO impact.  Moving on. Our same-store rental revenue decreased 3.2% during the quarter and 1.7% year-to-date. Our reported same-store growth includes deferred rent and unpaid rent that we have deemed to be collectible over the existing lease term, but it excludes rent where collectibility is deemed less than probable. The decrease in same-store rental revenue is primarily driven by reserves we recognized in the theater industry and to a lesser extent, the health and fitness industry.  Now to provide additional detail on our financial results for the quarter, I would like to hand it off to Christie. Thank you, Christie. As we reflect on 2020, we stand behind the overall resiliency of our portfolio. The relentless efforts of our team to add shareholder value and the outlook for our business over the long term. The momentum in our investment pipeline are ample sources of liquidity, and our size and scale positions us favorably to capitalize on near-term growth opportunities around the globe.  At this time, I would like to open it up for questions. Operator? Those are great questions, Vikram. And thank you. So at the end of the third quarter, we were right at 98.6%. And the question was asked, where do you think you're going to end the year up? And we had said that it was going to be right around 98%. And the fact that we came at 97.9% was fairly accurate. And what we saw coming was the NPC bankruptcy filing. As you might recall, we have approximately 150 assets with NPC, most of which happens to be the Pizza Hut. And then we have 19 assets that are Wendy's that's also run by NPC.  We were expecting 66 assets to be rejected through the bankruptcy process. And that was the reason why we had guided the market to a 98 -- approximately a 98% occupancy number. We were -- and those 66 assets did come back to us during the fourth quarter, which is the largest driver of this 97.9%. You will see that the net increase in vacant assets from third quarter to fourth quarter was circa 45 assets. So despite the fact that we got 66 assets back, we were able to resolve a lot more assets than we had originally thought because these assets are very well located, Vikram, and we were able to attract either QSRs that wanted to take some of these assets. And we feel very good about being able to resolve these assets fairly quickly.  The other point I'll make is most of these Pizza Huts with NPC had less than 2 years remaining on their lease term. And so our asset management team had already begun the process of trying to figure out alternatives. Knowing fully well that these were the assets that would come back, even if it were to have not filed bankruptcy.  So we feel pretty good about being able to resolve these assets. And as you can see from the resolution, we have the most number of resolutions in the fourth quarter. This was a record quarter for us. And so it's a testament to the team that we have in place, Ben and TJ, who drive that particular process for us, continue to do an absolutely amazing job despite the backdrop of the pandemic. And we are very hopeful that we will climb right back up above 98%.  Look, we have frictional vacancy, and we've always suggested that to the group that because we want to have the ability to reposition some of these assets, we are always going to be in this 98% -- circa 98% occupancy rate because we do want to reposition some of these assets, which does take us time, and that will continue to be what we target going forward. Yes. Good question, Haendel. As you pointed out, the lower cap rate was largely driven by the mix of assets that we purchased here in the U.S. If you look at the prepared remarks, I suggested that 29% of what we purchased here in the U.S. were industrial assets, single-tenant industrial assets. These were very well placed assets with clients that who are executing on their omnichannel strategy had lease terms that were north of 10 years, some 15-year leases, good growth in markets that we wanted to enhance our exposure and with rents that were right around market rents. And so as you know, the industrial assets tend to be trading a lot more aggressively. And as such, that certainly had a bit of a downdraft on our cap rate, but the fact that we were able to do 5.2% for the U.S. assets was largely driven by that. Sure. Again, good questions, Haendel. Look, we came out in early January with what our pipeline looked for the first quarter. And you might recall we had about $800 million -- slightly above $800 million that we had disclosed to the market at that time that we had in our pipeline, and we were 12 days into the year. So I don't think it should have come as a surprise that we had an incredibly healthy pipeline developed coming out of the fourth quarter. And if you look at what we were able to achieve in the fourth quarter of $1 billion, we had a tremendous amount of momentum that sort of carried forward into the first quarter and that has continued. It is also a testament to the amount of sourcing that we are able to do, the new swim lanes that we have created for ourselves to continue to grow the portfolio. And I think it's a testament to the strategy that we put in place a couple of years ago to be able to now post numbers that seem very large relative to what we have come out with in years past. But that's precisely the path that we wanted to go down.  You mentioned what is the expected cap rates? I think you should expected cap rates to be similar to what we achieved in 2020. And given the mix of portfolio, the optimal portfolio allocation that we have sort of highlighted to the market, it's really going to be a function of which particular portfolio or assets closed within a quarter as to whether the cap rates are going to come out.  If it's going to have a slightly more industrial plan to it, it's going to be lower cap rates. If it's going to be more retail, it's going to have a slightly higher cap rate. Having said that, even retail, especially though those types of retail that are deemed essential, portfolios are now trading in the mid-4s. And so the pricing environment has gotten a lot more aggressive. But thankfully, we have the cost of capital, and we were still able to generate 160 basis points of spread for the entire year, which is north of our historical spread. So we feel very good about the quality of assets we are buying and how we are reshaping our portfolio along the lines of what we had shared with the market in the third quarter, et cetera.  So really, the cap rate is going to be a function of the composition of assets that we drive within a given quarter.  The last question you had talked about was 1031. And what is the impact or our ability to issue OP units. Well, it's not new for us. We have done this in the past. We've bought assets from retail shareholders who wanted to buy -- wanted to take OP units as consideration for proceeds, and we were able to satisfy that. So could I see that momentum picking up potentially to defer having to pay taxes?  Absolutely. And we are very well equipped to take advantage of that. And use our equity as currency to provide that to potential sellers.  But having said all of that, 1031 is not a big part of our business, even on the disposition side. As you can see, most of the assets that we sell tend to be vacant assets, and that doesn't lend itself to the 1031 market. It's primarily developers or tenants who want to own their own assets that tend to play in that particular area. And on the occupied side, a lot of the transactions we did in 2020 were existing tenants exercising their option to purchase. And that's the reason why we were able to generate very good proceeds and very good overall returns. And the opportunistic sales tend to be an area where perhaps we run into some 1031 buyers. But that, I would say, is about 25% of the sellers that we interact with.  So for us, I think the -- on the disposition side is going to be fairly muted. On the acquisition side, I think not having 1031 be as aggressive, especially on the smaller boxes like QSRs and drug stores, et cetera. We could see cap rates increase because of the lack of 1031 buyers. And so that could potentially accrue to our benefit, especially when we are engaging in these one-off asset acquisitions. I know the question was geared towards Christie and Christie, please jump in. But why don't I take that a little bit? And then I'll hand it off to Christie, if that's okay, Greg.  For us, we wanted to make sure that we came out with a range that represented the facts on the ground today. And we wanted to make sure that the range was conservative enough where even if the situation were not to improve, and it was to be, as we have experienced early on in the year in January and December of last year that this is the range that we feel very comfortable with.  What I'm suggesting is that there could be a fair amount of upside to the range that we have shared. And it's largely a function of what's going to happen to the theater industry at large, but also, to a smaller extent, to the health and fitness industry. And there, we feel very confident that the theater business is going to improve, especially with the vaccination having taken hold and every day, we see more news about Pfizer and Moderna and now potentially J&J being on the approved list, that the acceleration of getting to a point where we have herd immunity is very realistic.  And I've seen base case models that suggest that as early as end of June, we could get close to having herd immunity. The other data point that I would point to, Greg, is what we have seen in China. And over the Chinese -- the Lunar New Year, we can -- they had record ticket sales. And in fact, one of the movies that was shown had almost $50 million more in sales than the record that had been set by Avengers: Endgame here in the U.S. and in Canada, and their opening we can't. And so all of these facts sort of lead us to believe that there is a possibility that there is a fair amount of upside on the assumptions that we have shown in our model. And that could that could help get us to the top end of the range. And if a lot of other things fall into place, potentially, we could do even better.  But we can't go out with that expectation. When you lay out all the various different scenarios. You come up with what's the probability weighted outcome. And that's what we have shared with the market. But there are things that could play in our favor, and it really is a function of how you think about the theater industry and what you think the recovery is going to look like. And we've shared with you at nauseam some of the assumptions that we have drawn in terms of taking 37 of our 77 assets and viewing it on a cash accounting basis and how that percolates through the base model. If your view shifts, to say, that's perhaps a bit too conservative then there is good upside. And that's what we are super excited about.  There are certainly other levers for us to play, like you correctly pointed out, the acquisition market is something we are super excited about. And part of it is intentional and part of it is a function of more and more operators and clients that we want to do business with, wanting to engage in sale-leaseback transactions. And so that too could act as a potential tailwind. And look, we've come out with numbers. You've seen our history about the early estimates that we come out with and what we are able to achieve during the year. But not saying that -- but there too, there could be some tailwinds. So there's acquisition fronts. There are assumptions that we have made about the theater business and the health and fitness business. There are assumptions we've made about how quickly we could get to a point where things are starting to normalize, et cetera.  And all of those have room and capacity for potentially surprising on the upside. So we feel pretty good. And I'll hand it back to Christie, if there's anything else you would like to add. Sure. So I would say about 20%. It's probably a little bit bigger than that. Of our leases have CPI adjustments. And -- but a lot of these have a floor in the ceiling associated with them. So yes, a rising CPI environment, we have some level of protection, but there does tend to be -- especially here in the U.S., there tends to be a floor in the ceiling associated with it.  For us, the -- we've encountered this problem before. What happens in an inflationary environment? The fact that we have leases that are net lease in nature. We are less sort of less susceptible to an environment where inflation expectation and actual inflation goes up because so much of the cost, either insurance, property, taxes, et cetera, are paid by our tenants. And so from that perspective, we feel pretty good. We started to see the 10-year treasury go up in anticipation of expected inflation going up. But thankfully, so far, our spreads have come down as well. And our all-in cost in the tenure has gone up slightly, but not dramatically. We can still issue tenure -- in today's environment, we think right around the 2122 ZIP code.  And that is still relative to what we've been able to do in the past, a very good all-in costs on the 10-year financing. So we feel pretty good about that. Some of this is now offset by what we are seeing in the U.K. as well as in Europe, where interest rates continue to be low, inflation expectations are very much contained. And so there, our all-in cost of financing continues to be super exciting. And so the fact that we have created all of these different alternatives also helps us shield us somewhat from inflation expectations arising in particular geographies and so we feel pretty good about that as well. And the fact that we have long-term leases also is a benefit.  Look, at some point, if the inflation expectations are going up, and it is largely translating to better GDP growth, et cetera, that should translate to better fundamentals for our tenants. And so not so much this year, we only have about 1.7% of our leases expiring. But in future years, that should start to reflect on higher market rents, et cetera. And so especially in 2022, 2023, we have a bit more of a expiration with regards to our leases, I could see us marking to market some of our leases during renewal time. And so I think from all of those perspectives, we feel pretty good.  One of the questions that often comes up, okay, if the interest rate environment continues to go up, it's going to impact your cost of capital, and that is absolutely true. But what we have found in prior cycles is that cap rates tend to follow suit as well. And there is definitely a lag, but it does sort of follow and then it allows us to continue to maintain the spreads that we have. And in certain situations, even enhance our spreads if the cap rate moves faster than our cost of capital. So we feel like we are very well positioned as a company. And based on some of the investments we've made and some of the areas that we have focused on, we feel like we are very well situated to handle an interest rate environment that increases an inflationary expectation environment that increases. Yes. So Rob, I think this question was asked last quarter as well. Look, we like to reach other business. But 1 of the lessons learned through this process is that should this represent at least when the pandemic started 6% of our overall portfolio. And I think what we have concluded through this process is that this business should survive but there will be some level of real estate rationalization. And we are very happy to have put together this portfolio largely through sale leasebacks with the operators themselves. And so feel very good about our current portfolio. But the idea long-term is to continue to dwindle our exposure to this particular industry to something that is closer to a 3% ZIP code. So I think that answers your question, Rob. We feel like, over time, we need to get it down to about 3% of our overall portfolio. Non-European U.K. acquisition. So how am I thinking about the U.K. acquisition? We've always said that U.K. was our first step into a European strategy, a western European strategy, and that continues to be the path that we are embarking upon, Rob.  We are very well-established in the U.K., some of the numbers that we have posted, I believe, is a testament to that statement. We -- I'm delighted to also share with you that we've hired another full-time person at Negara in our U.K. office. Who has a lot of experience doing acquisitions and has a lot of relationships, et cetera, in the Western Europe -- European markets. And so the goal is to continue to look for transactions and not be constrained by geography, but look for the right transactions. And there are markets that we have identified in Western Europe that we would like to be able to grow into. But it's largely a function of do we have the right operators willing to transact at the right prices, et cetera, et cetera. So are we open to acquiring in Western Europe? The answer is categorical yes. But do I expect to see something happen in Spain? I don't have a timeline for that or something in France or Italy or Germany, I don't have a timeline for you. It's largely going to be a function, what's available and who we can get to work with and whether they fit into our overall target client list. Absolutely. I mean, that's been our goal is try to minimize our exchange rate risk as much as we can, and we would follow a similar pattern to what we did in the U.K. where we did our debut, Sterling offering and prior to that, we had done a private placement, raising capital in U.K. denominated pounds. And that will continue to be how we finance our transactions. And that's where it becomes super exciting, Rob. I mean, you can do a 10-year paper in euro-denominated debt at 65, 70 basis points. Yes, cap rates are a lot more aggressive. But when you sort of factor in the cost of financing for somebody who's A-, A3 rated, it suddenly starts to make a lot of sense. And I think continuing to create alternative sources of capital, continuing to look at additional paths to growing our business is something that our platform allows us to do. And it's 1 that we are excited about, and we'll continue to push on. Yes. Brent, I don't know if you go to a local grocery even in this environment, you still find them fairly full. And I'm not trying to be facetious here. It is deemed an essential retail and they have continued to perform. Having said that, the most important thing that we are trying to focus on is the fact that the operators that we want to do business with, they have an omnichannel strategy. If you look at the U.K. grocers that we have partnered with, they dominate the click and collect market, and they dominate the delivery services. And so most of the partners that we have. And if you sort of unpack the 10%, and it's not quite 10%, but it's getting there of our exposure. You'll find that all of the operators that we have done business with are -- substantially all of the operators that we've done business with tend to have this omnichannel strategy, very well-established or in the process of having it very well established. They have the [indiscernible] and the balance sheet to do so.  And I do think that, that is going to be the future of this particular industry, which is why we got very comfortable but it's not just the industry, but it's the operators that we have targeted within these industries that we have done business with. And they will be not only surviving but thriving in the new environment where potentially, there is going to be more click and collect or delivery services. So we feel very good about our specific exposure within this industry. I don't know if this was a question or not as to whether -- are we sort of getting up against our limits with 10%. I would say, no. Our investment policy allows us to go as high as 15%. And for certain industries, we can always go back to the Board and request exceptions. But of course, we have to put forth our thesis as to why it makes sense. But this is an industry we feel very comfortable with, Brent. Well, it's -- I don't want to underplay what's happening in Texas. But thankfully, as far as our exposure in Texas is concerned, again, that's the advantage of having a triple net business is that it's largely being handled by the operators. And thankfully, the disruption was fairly short term. And so most of these businesses are going to be able to come back.  Yes, they may have some issues with product not making it through this blip, as you put it. But I don't see this as being a major issue for the specific clients that we have exposure to in Texas. Yes. Spenser, that's a great question. There's a reason why we have that sheet in our supplemental, and we want to lay it out as clearly as possible. This is another one of the avenues us to continue to gain exposure to certain clients and do it at a cap rate that is north of what you would be able to transact in the open market. And so it is about $160 million of commitment, $100 million of which is not funded yet. But if you look at the breakup, you will see that it's largely driven by 2 forward commitments we have on the non-retail side of the business. And so what that allows us to do is, again, enter into these contracts in a particular asset type that is trading super aggressively and be able to transact and get assets maybe 40, 50, 60 basis points north of where these assets would be trading have they been available today. And so I think that is part of the advantage of doing this. And this is, again, using our credit, using our scale and size to be able to get some of these assets at higher cap rates than what we would on the open market.  The other side of this is repositioning. I think it was Vikram, who had asked about, hey, how are you thinking about these assets from NPC. We have a history of being able to reposition some of our assets and be able to really capture and enhance our rent from the same exact location by simply repositioning these assets. And that is something we've been doing for a few years. They tend to be smaller dollar amounts.  But once again, we've given you that detail in the supplemental. And that will continue to be a bigger and bigger portion of our business. And I think as you've seen, the velocity of our lease terminations, et cetera, will only increase. And this part of our business, which we have seasoned over many years, will start to play a bigger, bigger role and will certainly, we hope, be a value-enhancing part of our business model.  And so I would love to see this business continue to increase within the parameters of what I just shared with you and help us create another source of value creation for the overall business. Not sure. But I think, Wes, we've talked about this again, some of these theaters are located in prime locations. And we've already shared with you that, look, we don't think that the footprint of the theater business, pre-pandemic is going to be exactly the same post pandemic. So there will be some level of rationalization. But the good news is there is a fair amount of demand for last mile distribution, and there's much more of a focus on development of multifamily, given some of the trends that we are seeing in some of these markets. So it is quite possible that these assets, given that they sit on potentially 10, 12, even 15 acres of land, could be repositioned to a higher and better use. But that question, Wes, I think, is going to be very specific to the particular location and where that particular theta falls in the performance rankings. And if it tends to be in the top 2 quartile, I would say that, yes, the likelihood of it remaining at theater is high. But if not, I could easily see it being repositioned.  Perhaps not easily but certainly repositioned. Christie, do you want to take this one? Yes. That's a very good question, Todd. What we had seen in -- even as late last year that there was a portfolio discount, not a portfolio premium. But there has -- we have seen a couple of portfolios come to market that have traded very expensively. And so I'm not quite sure where this trend is going to go, Todd. But -- and I think I mentioned this already that even some industries and some tenants that we had seen pre-pandemic are now trading at levels as a portfolio, 40, 50 basis points lower.  So it's tough to tell. I don't think it is a point that could be made across all industries and all operators. I do think that in most industries and especially the higher-yielding industries. If there's a portfolio transaction, you will tend to see a discount, not a premium. But in certain industries and the industries that are in favor today, we are certainly seeing a little bit of tightening. With regards to $3.25 billion, we are not underwriting to very large portfolio transactions. That is not part of our overall forecast, Todd. So if that were to happen, I think that would be above and beyond the numbers that we have shared with you. And so that, too, could be a potential tailwind for our business. As you might know, there are several public sale-leaseback transactions in the market, none of which are reflected in the numbers that we have shared.  With respect to cap rates, it is -- it has compressed. And it has compressed even over the last 5 months, 4 months. So whether it's retail here in the U.K. industrial, as you know, it's probably steady but still fairly aggressive cap rates. It's -- all has tended to become a lot more expensive today than it was 6 months ago.  In the U.K., thankfully, the cap rate market is a bit more stable. I wouldn't go so far as to say that it's compressing. But it's funny, we tend to do certain transactions where we are the only ones who are engaging in conversations and then we will find 1 or 2 other potential buyers start to come in on subsequent transactions.  So this is an interesting acquisitions environment that we find ourselves in right now. And -- but we feel very good. Again, the advantages that we have, we feel like we'll be able to get more than our share of transactions done, and we will continue to do it as spreads that will be very favorable and will help us drive earnings growth. Okay. Todd, any other questions? Yes. I could probably help with that a little bit. I mean, if we take a look at year-to-date, the January recollection was relatively consistent with what we've been seeing in the past months towards that 94% range. And essentially, the theater industry is still the majority at approximately 80%. And we did see some pickup as it relates to health and fitness. And it's a little early for February. But overall, as we said at the start of the call, it's consistent and steady. Yes. We can hear you, Mike. This is what happens when I'm in the office. Katie is in Philadelphia. We have an associated home. Creates that lot merging that doesn't work too well sometimes. I was wondering if you can provide some perspective. Obviously, when you switch over from banking, you went to Duke as the CFO. And then with CBRE, you sit on Park Hotels, Kite Realty, Tiers Board. You came out to Realty Income board last year. Net lease and what Realty Income is very different from those other companies in terms of the type of business in terms of creating growth with this longer duration net leases really where the competitive advantage is the cost of capital. And obviously, the relationships that the company has. But the secret to this company is being able to access well-priced capital and finding the deals. Just talk about sort of your perspectives and how you think the company should be capitalized?  How you think about capital raising relative to your prior experiences? Certainly, Michael. It's great. Great to hear your voice again, and I look forward to seeing you in person. But I wasn't at CBRE. I was at JLL. Not necessarily, Michael. I mean we were just taking advantage of the market at that point in time, and it was really an opportunistic play given the acquisition pipeline that we had in front of us. So you can expect us to still be managing our debt-to-equity equation thoughtfully in keeping with our A rating, but not being overly aggressive, if you will, to cause dilution. Joshua, I'll take that question. So we don't talk about specific transactions. You also can see that 7-Eleven is a top 10 tenant of ours. It's a client that we have done repeat business with. We help do their first sale-leaseback in 2016 and did subsequently 4 other sale leasebacks directly with them. So clearly, it's an operator. It's -- that we really like. It's in an industry that we like, and especially the standing that 7-Eleven has within the [indiscernible] store business, we really like their positioning. And so then the question becomes okay, what about the 11% industry exposures that you have to convenience store business. Is that a factor that could potentially curbed our ability to do more? And I think I've answered this question before, we have a limit of 15%, and we can always get exceptions in the event we can make the case that a particular industry is one that we are very favorable, we implying towards and would like to see it increase. And this is one of those industries that we would feel very comfortable in increasing our allocation to. But again, we have to be very specific that it's industry increase in allocation, but with particular clients in mind and 7-Eleven would that will be falling in that bucket. Are you asking us about whether we would be willing to take the tenant concentration? Or is this a general question, Linda? Sure. So that's 1 of the things that we talked about, Linda, is the fact that we do have the size and the scale to absorb large portfolios. Now the way I would define large portfolios is $1 billion plus. Most peers would run into concentration questions doing half that size. Especially if they already have a preexisting exposure to that particular client. But we find ourselves in the enviable position of being able to continue to increase the allocation for a given client, and it's largely a testament to the size of our overall business and balance sheet. But clearly, when you start talking $5 billion, $6 billion, those are types of transactions that don't come very often. And when they do, outside of us, I don't know if there is any other public net lease buyer that could potentially entertain absorbing that sort of size.  Then in terms of who are the alternative buyers of this. It's largely driven by what is available on the financing side of the equation. And ABS has become a preferred mechanism of financing these large scale transactions, especially with highly rated operators. And then once those boxes are checked, you can pretty much assume some of the private equity folks getting involved and being super excited about playing in that size because they can put capital to work, and lever up the portfolio to, call it, 85%, 90% and be able to get very -- enhance their cash-on-cash yield. So that's the group that would be the traditional competition for very large sale-leaseback opportunities with highly rated operators.  But when interest rate starts to move in the direction that it has, then that does start to put pressure on some of these players because the cost of financing on that 80%, 90% leverage starts to creep up. So it really is going to have to be coupled with what we see in the financing market to help define who the potential competition could be. Yes. I'll let Christie answer that. Yes. I can answer that. Yes, about 41 of these assets, when we did our internal analysis, we deemed them to be in this top quartile. And that's how we came up with the 41. But when we talked about us getting some rent from both AMC as well as Regal, especially in the month of December. It was across the entire portfolio. So even those assets, those 37 assets that we have on cash accounting, they paid us rent. Not 100%. But they paid us some rent for the month of December, and that's really the upside for us going forward. So thank you, everyone, for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you at the upcoming virtual conferences. Take care. Bye-bye."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would like to now hand the conference over to your speaker today, Andrew Crum, Associate Director of Realty Income. Please go ahead, sir.\nAndrew Crum: Thank you, all, for joining us today for Realty Income's third quarter 2020 operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jonathan Pong, Senior Vice President, Head of Capital Markets and Finance. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under Federal Securities Law. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company's Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two-question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you'd like to ask additional questions, you may reenter the queue. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy.\nSumit Roy: Thanks, Andrew. Welcome, everyone. As we remain in a remote work environment to promote the safety of our employees and community, I continue to be impressed by the resiliency and talent of our team to drive our business forward through the current pandemic. I also remain appreciative of the support and resiliency of our clients and partners, who continue to perform under difficult circumstances. On the personnel front, we were excited to announce that Christie Kelly has been appointed Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. And we look forward to Christie joining us in January. Christie's depth and breadth of experience with leading real estate companies will be immediately additive to our team. Over the last year she has been a valuable member of our Board of Directors and the Board's Audit Committee, which will further promote a smooth transition. I look forward to partnering with Christie to continue advancing Realty Income's strategy and objectives. Moving on to a summary of the quarter. During the third quarter we invested approximately $659 million in high-quality real estate including $230 million in the UK, which brings us to nearly $1.3 billion invested year-to-date. Investments during the quarter were primarily concentrated in the home improvement, convenience store and grocery store industries, each of which continue to perform well through the current environment. On October 1, we diversified our access and presence in the global capital markets as we closed on our debut public debt issuance of Sterling-denominated notes, raising \u00a3400 million in 10-year notes, with an effective annual yield to maturity of 1.71%. We are grateful for the support we received from the UK fixed income investors community, and we look forward to building on these relationships in the years to come. We took steps to further position our balance sheet for growth during the quarter, as we raised approximately $349 million of equity, primarily through our ATM program. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDAR ratio at quarter end was 5.3 times, which is well within our target leverage ratio, and provides a significant financial flexibility moving forward. Based on the strength of our investment pipeline and our continued access to well priced capital, we're increasing 2020 acquisitions guidance to approximately $2 billion. Moving on to investment activity during the quarter. In the third quarter of 2020, we invested approximately $659 million in 89 properties located in 21 states in the United Kingdom, at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.4%, and with a weighted average lease term of 12.7 years. On a total revenue basis, approximately 73% of total acquisitions during the quarter were from investment grade rated tenants or their subsidiaries. Of the $659 million invested during the quarter, $429 million was invested domestically in 82 properties at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.9%, and with a weighted average lease term of 15.4 years. During the quarter, $230 million was invested internationally in seven properties located in the UK, at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 7.5%, and with a weighted average lease term of 8.9 years. Year-to-date, we have invested approximately $1.3 billion in 180 properties located in 28 States and the UK, at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.3% and with a weighted average lease term of 13.1 years. On a revenue basis, 56% of total acquisitions are from investment grade rated tenants or their subsidiaries. Of the $1.3 billion invested year-to-date $845 million was invested domestically in 167 properties, at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.2% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.8 years. Year-to-date approximately $454 million was invested internationally in 13 properties located in the UK, at weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.4% and with a weighted average lease term of 10 years. Transaction flow remains healthy, as we sourced approximately $14.1 billion in the third quarter. Of this amount, $10 billion was domestic opportunities and $4.1 billion were international opportunities. Of the opportunity source during the third quarter, 53% were portfolios and 47% or approximately $6.7 billion were one-off assets. Year-to-date we sourced approximately $46.6 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of the $659 million in total acquisitions closed in the third quarter, 44% were one-off transactions. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy during the quarter, averaging approximately 164 basis points for domestic investments, and 328 basis points for international investments. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. Our investment pipeline remains robust, and we are well-positioned with strong financial flexibility to capitalize on opportunities going forward, resulting in our increased acquisition guidance. Moving to dispositions, during the quarter we sold 36 properties for net proceeds of $50 million, and we realized an unlevered IRR of 19.7%. This brings us to 65 properties sold year-to-date for $183.6 million at a net cash cap rate of 6.6%. And we realized an unlevered IRR of 13.6%. Our portfolio remains well diversified by tenant, industry, geography and property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At quarter end, our properties were leased to approximately 600 tenants in 51 separate industries located in 49 states, Puerto Rico and the UK. Approximately 85% of rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at over 10% of rental revenue. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 5.8% of rental revenue. Convenience stores remain our largest industry at 12.1% of rental revenue. Within our overall retail portfolio, approximately 95% of our rent comes from tenants with a service non-discretionary and/or low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to operate in a variety of economic environments, and to compete more effectively with e-commerce. These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate, where the vast majority of recent U.S. retail bankruptcies have been in industries that do not possess these characteristics. We remain constructive on the credit quality of the portfolio, with approximately half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade rated tenants. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.6%, an increase of 10 basis points versus the prior quarter. During the quarter, we re-leased 80 properties recapturing 99.2% of the expiring rent year-to-date - sorry, year-to-date, we re-leased 238 properties, recapturing 99.8% of the expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold over 3,400 properties with leases expiring, recapturing over 100% of rent on those properties that were re-leased. Rent collection across our portfolio has remained stable. During the third quarter we collected 93.1% of contractual rent due, and we collected 92.9% of contractual rent for the month of October. Further improvements in rent collection percentages is primarily dependent on improvements in the theatre industry, which I will touch on shortly. Our collection rates are calculated as the cash rent collected, divided by the contractual rent charge for the applicable period. Charge amounts have not been adjusted for any COVID-19 related rent relief granted, and do include contractual base rents from any tenants and bankruptcies. We collected 100% of contractual rent for the third quarter from investment grade rated tenants, which further validates the importance of high-quality real estate portfolio leased to large well-capitalized clients. While we have not historically prioritized investment grade rated tenants as a primary objective, during periods of economic uncertainty, high grade credit tenants tend to provide more reliable streams of income as the last three quarters have proven out. Our top four industries, convenience stores, drug stores, grocery stores and dollar stores, each sell essential goods and represent approximately 37% of rental revenue. And we have received nearly all of the contractual rent due to us from tenants in these industries since the pandemic began. Uncollected rent continues to be primarily in the theater and health and fitness industries, as these industries account for approximately 80% of uncollected rents during the third quarter. As we continue to manage our portfolio to support long-term value creation, we believe the breadth and depth of our asset management and real estate operations department, which is our company's largest department is a key competitive advantage vis-\u00e0-vis our competitors. I would also like to update the investment community on our latest views on the theater industry. The industry represents 5.7% of our contractual base rent. And while we do expect the industry to downsize in the future, we continue to believe it will remain a viable industry in a post-pandemic environment, especially for high budget blockbuster movies. As a reminder, U.S. Box Office reached an all-time high as recent as 2018, and 2019 produced the highest grossing worldwide film of all time an Avengers: Endgame. Further, recent reports from China where over 80% of movie theaters are open, show that daily box office revenue has recovered to 2019 levels. Though we acknowledge that cultural nuances do influence theater attendance, it remains a relevant data point. We continue to believe particularly for blockbuster movies, that a theatrical release will be the preferred distribution channel for studios going forward, given the superior economics afforded to them versus the streaming platform. That said, we do recognize that the industry is changing, and that there will likely be a rationalization of theatres in a post-pandemic reality. Under this scenario, underperforming theatres may not survive. Near-term, there are several uncertainties facing the industry particularly around, when the major movie studios will feel comfortable releasing their films through the theatrical distribution channel. And with theaters in New York City and Los Angeles, the two largest markets in the U.S. remaining shuttered, we like others who follow the industry lack clarity as to whether studios will be inclined to release blockbuster films. As a result, our confidence level associated with the collectability of a portion of our outstanding theater receivables has diminished, and the near-term solvency risk facing the two largest operators in the space, AMC and Cineworld is incrementally more pronounced. To that end, we believe it is prudent to establish a full reserve for the outstanding receivable balance for 37 of our 78 total theater assets, and to move to cash accounting for revenue recognition purposes, for these 37 assets going forward. We deemed the collectability of rents for these 37 theater assets to be less than probable, based on a variety of factors including the store level performance of these assets. To be clear, we believe our theater portfolio is one of very high-quality, and we estimate that 82% of theatres in our portfolio are in the top two quartile of each operator's portfolio in terms of store level performance. Specifically, of the 72 theater assets that we have recent unit level financial information on, we estimate that 41 are in the top quartile, 18 are in the second quartile, 11 are in the third quartile, and two are in the bottom quartile, based on pre-pandemic EBITDAR performance. Our criteria to determine which of these assets to move to cash accounting was predicated on a holistic approach, based largely on these productivity rankings on a pre-rent and post-rent basis. We determined that 31 of these assets most of which were still profitable based on pre-pandemic financials, generated EBITDA that prevented us from deeming collection as probable. Of the remaining six assets for which we are reserving, we did not have access to unit level financial information to assess collectability. Thus, as a conservative measure, we reserve for those six assets as well. The financial impact of our theater reserves is $17.2 million of reserves recognized for these 37 assets, $1.6 million of which is straight line rent receivable reserve, and thus has no AFFO impact. The third quarter impact is approximately $0.04 per share diluted to AFFO, and $0.05 per share diluted to FFO. And going forward, we will not accrue revenue on these assets unless we actually collect the cash rent, all we determine collectability has become probable again. During the quarter, we recorded provisions for impairment of approximately $105 million, $79 million of which was associated with 12 theater assets. To arrive at the appropriate impairment for our theater assets, we analyzed the same 37 assets where collection probability was deemed less than probable. Of the 37 assets we analyzed, we determined that 12 assets had a probability weighted undiscounted cash flow that was less than the current net book value of the assets. Accordingly, we impaired the carrying value of these 12 assets down to their estimated fair value. As a reminder, provisions for impairment only impact net income and has no impact on the company's FFO or AFFO. Now I'd like to outline our current thoughts on the long-term outlook for our overall portfolio revenue stream, almost all of which we expect to remain intact in a post-pandemic world. As discussed, we do expect a level of rationalization in the overall theatre industry, which may require repositioning some of our properties. The theaters most likely to be impacted going forward would be a subset of the 37 properties, which we have moved to cash accounting, which in total represent $33.3 million of annual rent, or 2% of our annual rent. To be clear, we do not expect to lose the entirety of rent associated with these properties longer-term, even in the event of potential closures. Beyond the theatre industry, we continue to monitor select tenants in the health and fitness and restaurant industries in particular. Though the overall diversity credit and real estate quality of our portfolio gives us comfort that any longer-term rent loss would be fairly modest. Moving on, our same-store rental revenue decreased 4.4% during the quarter and 1.5% year-to-date. Our reported same-store growth includes deferred rent and unpaid rent that we have deemed to be collectible over the existing lease term, but similarly excludes rent where collectability is deemed less than probable. The decrease in same-store rental revenue is primarily driven by reserves we recognize in the theatre industry, and to a lesser extent the health and fitness industry. I will provide additional detail on our financial results for the quarter starting with the income statement. Our G&A expense as a percentage of rental and other revenue for the quarter was 4.3%. Our year-to-date G&A expense ratio excluding approximately $3.5 million of severance related to the departure of our former CFO was 4.5%. We continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector, reflecting our best in class efficiency and the scale benefits afforded to us given our size. Our non-reimbursable property expense as a percentage of rental and other revenue was 1.9% for the quarter, and 1.5% year-to-date. AFFO per share during the quarter was $0.81, and $2.55 year-to-date. Our AFFO per share for the quarter was negatively impacted by the recording of non-straight line rent reserves of approximately $21.8 million during the quarter, which represented $0.06 per share of dilution. Year-to-date our AFFO per share was negatively impacted by non-straight line rent reserves of approximately $29.3 million, which represents $0.09 per share of dilution. Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we have continued to maintain our conservative capital structure and remain one of only a handful of REITs with at least two A ratings. During the quarter we issued $315 million of notes due 2031 for an effective annual yield to maturity of 2.34%, and subsequent to quarter end, we completed a debut public offering of Sterling denominated senior unsecured notes for \u00a3400 million due 2030, for an effective annual yield to maturity of 1.71%. Additionally, we raised approximately $349 million of equity during the quarter, primarily through our ATM program. Year-to-date, we have raised nearly $2.7 billion of well-priced capital, including approximately $1.22 billion of equity, and $1.47 billion of debt. We ended the quarter with low leverage and strong coverage metrics with net debt to adjusted EBITDAre ratio of 5.3 times, or 5.2 times on a pro forma basis, adjusting for the annualized impact of acquisitions and dispositions during the quarter. And our fixed charge coverage ratio remains strong at 5.2 times. We continue to have very minimal net short-term borrowing, as $856 million outstanding on the line and through our CP program was largely offset with approximately $725 million of cash on hand. Looking forward, our overall debt maturity schedule remains in excellent shape, with less than $80 million of debt maturities through yearend 2021, excluding CP borrowings. And the weighted average maturity of our bonds is a healthy 8.2 years. In summary, our balance sheet is in great shape, and we continue to have no leverage, strong coverage metrics and ample liquidity. In September, we increased the dividend for the 108th time in our company's history. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of approximately 4.5%. And we are proud to be one of only three REITs in the S&P 500 dividend aristocrat's index for having increased their dividend every year, for the last 25 consecutive years. In summary, we are confident in the overall resiliency of our portfolio, and believe our strategy of partnering with large, well-capitalized operators who are leaders in their respective industries will continue to be a successful strategy. The momentum in our investment pipeline, our ample sources of liquidity, and our size and scale position as favorably to capitalize on near-term growth opportunities. At this time, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nate Crossett from Berenberg. Your line is now open.\nNate Crossett: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Maybe you could just characterize the deal flow heading into the end of the year. Guidance implies a further ramp into 4Q. So, some more color there would be helpful. Where's that weighted in terms of geographies, concepts? Are there any portfolios in there? And then comments on pricing would be helpful?\nSumit Roy: Sure. There's a bunch of questions in there, Nate. So, I'll try to take it one at a time. Look, I think during the second quarter earnings announcement, I had suggested that the pipeline was building up very strong, the sourcing data was incredibly high. And that momentum has continued in the third quarter based on almost $14.5 billion of sourcing. The good news with regards to this sourcing number is that it is fairly well distributed across geographies. I would say $10 billion or two-thirds of it was U.S., one-third is UK. And that mix has been fairly consistent throughout the year of the $47 billion odd that we've sourced. With regards to the product that we are pursuing and what the cap rate environment looks like. It is largely in what will be deemed as essential retail. So grocery stores, home improvement, convenience stores, dollar stores, there continues to be enough product within those sectors, that's keeping us busy. And again, especially on the grocery side, as well as to a lesser extent on the home improvement side, we continue to see both those industries very well represented in the UK. You talked about cap rates or pricing was a specific question. Look, we continue to see pricing cap rates compress, both here in the U.S. as well as in the UK. And this is across asset types, both on the industrial single tenant industrial side, as well as the high-quality retail assets that we are targeting and pursuing. I would say that investment grade rated retail today in the U.S. is in the low 5s to potentially even a four handle for certain assets. And it very rarely gets above a six cap. If you start to look beyond investment grade, yes, you will get in the low 5s to potentially in the low 7s. But there is very few products that we are pursuing that has a seven handle in front of it. And in the UK, the pricing is even more competitive. Especially on the grocery side, you'll find product on the retail side of the equation in the low to sort of 4.2% 4.3% zip code to the mid-5. On the single tenant industrial side across both the U.S. and UK cap rates have compressed, very good product with tenants that we would like to partner with, with long-term leases are trading in the low 4s. So it is a very expensive market. But this is where relationships and previous relationships with tenants and brokers and the folks that control some of the transactions, the developers et cetera that really comes to the forefront. And we feel very good about the pipeline that we've built. It's part of the reason why we were sitting on some cash in recognition of being able to finance right off of our balance sheet.\nNate Crossett: Okay, that's all very helpful. Thank you. Just quickly, if we go back into a lockdown, and I guess UK is going into a lockdown this week. What's the impact that you see on the pipeline? Is it different time around I guess is the question?\nSumit Roy: Yes, so I'll answer your UK question first, Nate. Again, what they are shutting down tends to be gyms, movie theaters, casual dining concepts, bars, et cetera. And we have no exposure to any of those industries, say for one theater in the UK. Most of our exposure happens to be in the grocery side of the business, and more recently, in the home improvement side of the business, which is deemed as essential retail and will continue to remain open. And these are the precise industries that have actually experienced tailwinds during this pandemic, because of some of the social distancing and stay at home norms that have been adopted by the consumer base. So, we feel pretty good about our portfolio and its ability to perform in the event of a prolonged shutdown in the UK. Here in the U.S., we've also sort of very much bookended where the risk lies, and it is primarily in the theater business, and that's the reason why we spend so much of the time discussing our thesis and walking you through why we've done what we've done in the theater side of the business. Outside of the theater business, its health and fitness to a lesser extent. And the issue of being able to continue to operate a fitness center at 50% capacity is not an issue in and of itself, because most of the time at the peak capacity levels, they rarely go above that 50%, 55% to begin with. And again, given our main two exposures in the health and fitness businesses to the Lifetime and LA Fitness, they continue to be largely open at this point. And I think in the month of October, we collected 83% of the rent. So, we feel that at least with this particular industry, we bookended the risk fairly well. But, look, if we go into a big shut down, I do think that, some of the other industries that were impacted casual dining, Daycare Centers, et cetera, they are much better equipped to handle a prolonged shutdown today than they were in the month of April. And we feel better about their ability to continue to use some of the avenues that they've created, i.e. click and collect, drive-thru, et cetera, as a method to continue to operate their businesses in a way where they can continue to pay us rent. So, the industry that I feel that is going to be - and it continues to be impacted is the theater industry. But outside of that, I think we feel pretty good about the operators we are exposed to in some of these other industries that that could be impacted. But we feel like they'll fare much better this time around than they did in April.\nNate Crossett: Okay, thank you.\nSumit Roy: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Katy McConnell from Citi. Your line is now open.\nKaty McConnell: Okay, great. Thanks. Can you provide some color on the portion of larger portfolio deals completed this quarter, as far as pricing and tenant credit for those? And any other opportunities like that, that you're looking at today they've done market construction?\nSumit Roy: Yes. Sure, Katie. Look 55% of what we closed were portfolio deals in the third quarter. So, we continue to see a very healthy flow of portfolio transactions. And truth be told, that's what moves the needle for us, especially on the retail side of the equation. But the comment around cap rates continues to be true Katie, even portfolios are trading at more aggressive cap rates than they were six months ago. And we closed on a transaction in the third quarter with a client that we have a very good relationship with, and the cap rate we ended up paying on that particular portfolio was 20 basis points inside of where we did the previous sale leaseback with them on. And then subsequent to that, we've seen cap rates compress even further. And so yes, we have seen a very healthy pipeline of portfolio transactions and some staggeringly large portfolios are out there in the market. And it's public, in terms of, what they are. And so that's a very good situation for a company like ours, where we have the ability to write, do much larger transactions without running into concentration issues, and especially if it is with a relationship client and that has not abated. And it's not just a phenomenon that we're seeing here in the in the U.S. We are seeing portfolio transactions in the UK as well. And in fact, we ended up closing on a portion of a portfolio transaction that we did with one of our very good relationships in the UK in the third quarter as well. And so the momentum that we've been able to generate both here in the U.S. and the UK continues to be very strong. And that's what gives us the confidence of having increased our guidance by $500 million at the midpoint of our previous acquisition guidance.\nKaty McConnell: Thanks for the color. And then just a quick follow-up. Could you talk about the progress you've made so far in the held for sale assets? And what you're seeing so far, regarding pricing indication? And do you expect a royalty of rent in the industry volume next year to sell down more of your high-risk exposure outside of figures?\nSumit Roy: Absolutely, Katie. I mean, we are already up to $186 million. And I think you can expect a similar run rate in the fourth quarter, which will be one of the larger disposition strategies that we've had or disposition amounts that we've had in the recent past. And the commentary on cap rates continues to be true on the disposition side of the equation as well. So of course, these are assets that no longer strategically fit the profile of our optimal portfolio, but there continues to be a market for it. And that's the reason why we were able to achieve such high double digit, high teen type unlevered IRRs, because the market is very conducive to sell into. And we will continue to do that going forward. But again, it's a story of two baskets, if you will. There's definitely a very healthy appetite for all of the industries that I've talked about as being essential retail, and cap rates are incredibly aggressive in that particular bucket. But if you look at assets in the health and fitness business, or if you look at assets in the theater business, there is no market right now. So, yes, we can continue to call our portfolio and evolve towards our optimal portfolio. But it's not a market where you can sell, essentially, any asset that you have, or you desire to sell. So, I think we have to take that into consideration as well.\nKaty McConnell: Thank you.\nSumit Roy: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Spenser Allaway from Green Street. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, thank you. This is Harsh, filling in for Spenser. Could you talk a little bit about your disposition activity, just building on that sort of the tenant or industry, or the particular geography that you're looking to exit from, which may not be strategically fitting with your portfolio rate?\nSumit Roy: Yes. So Harsh, I think, in trying to answer Katy's question, I talked about the volume, but I'll get a bit more specific. The assets that we are selling are, there was some grocery assets that we sold with operators that we didn't seem like fit our profile for the long-term, and we're able to get very aggressive pricing. All of the assets sold were here in the U.S. So I just want to make that point very clear. And then there were some assets that we've sold on the convenience store side of the business. And these tend to be formats, that, again, is not what we would be pursuing actively. So these are more like kiosks, 1,500 square feet boxes, with half an acre, with potentially tenants that don't quite have the credit profile that we would like to have long-term, there continues to be a market for those types of products and so we're selling those assets. And then of course, we sell a lot of vacant assets as well in this market. And despite the fact that we are in the midst of a pandemic there continues to be especially for well-located vacant assets, there continues to be an appetite amongst the developer community to come in and buy those fairly aggressively. And so that's the makeup of some of the assets that we've been selling. And another industry that I would throw in there is the restaurant business. So some of the assets that we've sold, happened to be in the restaurant business.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you. And just talking about theater again. How many of the 37 theaters that forbids collection were deemed less than probable? I have leases that are expiring in the next two years. And then on that where that would impaired? Can you provide some more color on them, like the tenants they were leased to or geographies they were in, like within major city center or something like that?\nSumit Roy: Sure. So, the way we sort of went through the analysis, I think I went through it in a fair amount of detail, but I'll just be brief. On the 31 of the 37 assets, they happen to be two of them were in the top quartile of performance, 16 were in the second quartile, 11 in the third quartile, and two in the fourth quartile. And then there were six assets for which we didn't have financial information. And so that's the 37 assets that we deemed, as being ones that in a conservative scenario, if there was going to be rationalization in the theatre business, we couldn't say with a high probability of a collection that we'll be able to collect rent, and so we move them to cash accounting. Of those 37 assets, we did the impairment analysis, because anytime we move to cash accounting that's a trigger for impairment. 12 of those assets were deemed as being impaired. And there are several analyses that we go through when you compare the undiscounted cash flow to the net book value, and if it's less than the net book value, we take an impairment. And so those 12 assets resulted in $79 million of the $105 million of impairment. And then there was another asset that we had an office asset that resulted in about $18 million of impairment. And then that basically constituted the vast majority of the $105 million. The lease terms remaining on the portfolio on the entire theater industry, I think it's in the high single digits for both Regal as well as AMC.\nUnidentified Analyst: That's helpful. Thank you so much.\nSumit Roy: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Greg McGinniss from Scotiabank. Your line is now open.\nGreg McGinniss: Hey Sumit. The average investment size in UK this year, it's over $30 million a property versus the $5.5 million in the U.S., which I imagine is just a function of focusing on grocery store acquisitions in the UK. And I'm curious is that the trend we should expect to continue regarding larger average asset size in UK index universal property types available or meeting your underwriting standards is more limited than in the U.S.?\nSumit Roy: That's a very good observation, Greg. And because we have very tightly defined parameters for what we are going to pursue in the UK, they tend to fall in one of two buckets, it's either going to be and mostly it's going to be in the grocery side of the equation, or it's going to be home improvement. And those boxes tend to be larger, and they tend to be very well located, they tend to be located in high demographic regions. And they have a price point of right around $30 million to $45 million apart. And then when you supplement that with industrial assets that we are also pursuing, again, very rigid standards. Those will tend to be even higher than that, 2x that in some cases. So that's the product mix that you're going to find us pursuing in the UK. And that's the reason why those price per property points in the UK are going to be much larger. Here in the U.S., obviously, we go after a lot of discrete quick service restaurants, et cetera, which could trade at $1.5 million per part. And so on average the $4 million to $5 million is the average per property that you find here in the U.S., but that's what drives the differences.\nGreg McGinniss: Thanks. And then shifting gears thinking about industrial acquisitions. Now, I know you mentioned that cost of capital is an issue regarding execution. There are a couple peers in the net lease space that appear to be maybe somewhat more successful at closing industrial and like manufacturing deals this year, one of which focuses on sale leaseback in the space and another that's trying to make inroads. Are these deals that you're seeing and turning down? Or am I just kind of off the mark here on this comparison because we prefer a different asset or tenant space? Any new case and cover on why you may or may not be pursuing or sourcing certain deals will be appreciated?\nSumit Roy: Sure. And look, I don't want to speak to what our competitors are doing, Greg. But the assets that we are pursuing, with the operators that we are pursuing on the industrial side, yes, we have come across mid-6%, high-6% deals, but for a variety of reasons. And it's largely driven by where these assets are located or the tenant and the credit that the tenant has or the type of business that they are involved in. It just doesn't get us comfortable. And so we walk away from those transactions. The ones that we are pursuing, they happen to be in the zip code that I've shared with you with regards to pricing. And so it has been a bit challenging for us. And thankfully, we've got the cost of capital to pursue some not all of these transactions and that's what we're trying to do is be as clinical as we can, leverage the relationships that we have. But in some cases, pricing gets to a point where we just have to walk away.\nGreg McGinniss: Okay, that's fair. Thank you.\nSumit Roy: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brent Dilts from UBS. Your line is now open.\nBrent Dilts: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So first, could you provide some color on how competition in the transaction market has evolved during the pandemic? And I'm specifically looking for maybe like how much capital you're seeing come in from outside the industry, places like private equity, pension funds, et cetera?\nSumit Roy: Yes, happy to answer that. At the very beginning, I want to say right around June, et cetera, when we were reengaging, I'll tell you that we were amongst the very few that was still active in the acquisitions market. And we certainly took advantage of that. In some cases, we had transactions that we had sort of suspended, just entering into the pandemic, those came back to us. And we were able to transact some of those at slightly higher cap rates, but very, very quickly that scenario has changed. And it has become far more competitive. Even though some of our public peers have not fully engaged in the acquisitions market, there is plenty of capital chasing product on the retail side, which is where the surprise has been. The industrial has been less surprising to us. Even though, over the last six months, we've seen pricing get fairly aggressive. And there, we do see a lot of international money chasing well located long-term leases. But the biggest surprise for us has been on the retail side. The product that we're chasing, it's not surprising that that should attract the preponderance of capital. And we have seen that, and so that I think is the main reason why cap rates have gotten compressed. And now it's pretty aggressive out there.\nBrent Dilts: Okay, great. And then just sticking with the transaction market, how has bid-ask spreads changed during the year? And has there been a big variance by tenant industry?\nSumit Roy: Well, clearly transactions that are occurring. So, we just raised our guidance to $2 billion, approximately $2 billion. And so, this is obviously a testament to the pipeline that we have, transactions that we've already got over the finish line. I think, there's plenty of transactions that will get done. The fixed income market is obviously incredibly - the cost of capital in the fixed income market is incredibly low right now, it's very competitive. And so this is where, our ratings et cetera come into the forefront because if one-third of the financing is coming from there, our overall cost of capital does allow us to continue to play even though the markets have gotten aggressive. Clearly, there was a period where very, very few transactions were getting done. And this is the month of April, which is when everybody was trying to get their arms around the pandemic, et cetera. But I would say that lasted all of four to six weeks, and immediately after that, transactions got done. And they got done at higher levels in the month of June, July than they are getting down today.\nBrent Dilts: Great. Thanks, Sumit.\nSumit Roy: Yes.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from line of Linda Tsai from Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nLinda Tsai: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for the detail on the theatres. When you look at the pre-pandemic profitability for the 41 theaters not on cash accounting, what's your base case for how long the recovery takes to approach those prior levels?\nSumit Roy: Yes. Linda, that's a great question. And I wish I had an answer for you, I can't share with you that those 41 assets are obviously in the top quartile of performance. They all cleared EBITDA, which is post rent obligations, et cetera, north of $1 million per asset. And so, those were the best of the best assets that either of the two large operators have, that's part of our portfolio. And so, as to when can they get back to those levels, I did share with you that in China, even though they have some constraints in capacity, they're already at pre-pandemic levels. This is largely going to be a function of when the studios feel comfortable, releasing these assets to the theaters, and if they keep pushing the high budget content further in and further out, the further out, it will be when these assets when these theaters can generate that $1 million plus of EBITDAs. And right now this on December 24, we still have the Wonder Woman movie that is still scheduled to come out. The James Bond film got moved out to April of next year. If those start to remain, and if the content that has been pushed out next year does come in next year, and we have a vaccine over the next 60 days and people start to feel more comfortable about being able to go back to the theaters, I can see this rebounding fairly quickly. But the question remains there are so many ifs, right, when will the vaccine come out, when will the customers feel confident of coming back. And we have some data points to point to, we also believe that streaming is not going to be the preferred route for these high budget movies, just because the math doesn't play out. And so I think it really is directly tied to when the studios are going to release the content and the customers feel comfortable in being able to go back, and I think that's going to be a function of when we have a vaccine available. So, if those play out, I think very quickly thereafter, I can see these assets starting to go north of $1 million again.\nLinda Tsai: Got it. And so are these better positioned theatres on percentage rents right now?\nSumit Roy: So a lot of these assets we have basically constructed through sale leasebacks that we entered into with both Regal as well as with AMC. And these were assets that AMC and Regal used to own on their balance sheet. And so they tend to be the better performing assets anyway. And what we have continue to do is to invest, we invested with them when they change the format to accommodate the better seating and the stadium seating and the food and beverage, et cetera. And as part of that, we entered into percentage rent, participation with some of these operators. And so, I don't have the precise number in terms of how many of these assets are on percentage rent, but I do know that, as part of entering into a capital contribution to repurpose some of these assets, we did have percentage rental.\nLinda Tsai: Thank you. And then just one follow-up. In terms of the subset of the 37 assets that would be up for repositioning. What are some alternative uses?\nSumit Roy: Yes, and that's why we continue to be positively surprised, Linda. So, unsolicited, we received some feedback on one of our theater assets where a developer shared with us that it could be positioned to a mixed-use multifamily side, it's very well located. Another one was identified as a potential last mile distribution center, because these tend to be 12, 13 acres parcels and so you could easily create 100,000 square foot last mile distribution center. Now, of course, you have to go through zoning, et cetera. But we feel that, because of where these assets are located, they can be repositioned and we will come out. Okay, it's just a matter of time and commitment and capital commitment. But unsolicited, the feedback we've received so far, because people are all tracking what's happening in the theatre business. We feel that we've come out okay, in the event that we need to position some of these assets.\nLinda Tsai: Thank you.\nSumit Roy: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Massocca from Ladenburg Thalmann. Your line is now open.\nJohn Massocca: Good afternoon.\nSumit Roy: Hi, John, how are you?\nJohn Massocca: Good. How about yourself?\nSumit Roy: Good.\nJohn Massocca: Hopefully, it doesn't sound a question. Can you maybe touch on theaters? If an operator went into bankruptcy, would that move all the theaters lease the tenant that was bankrupt? But those theaters that hadn't been put into this kind of cash accounting bucket, would that move them into cash accounting? Essentially, what is the potential for kind of another one-time hit the AFFO something does happen to Cineworld or AMC?\nSumit Roy: Yes. Look, if they cease to exist, there is no doubt. They file Chapter 11. Chapter 11 filing in and of itself is not a triggering event. It's just like, what are they planning and doing? What's their path forward? But if it switches over into Chapter 7, then clearly, we're going to write off even the 41 assets that is not on cash accounting, right now, we immediately shift to cash accounting on that. So that's the quick answer on what you just suggested. And that is the reason why we are continuing to monitor AMC came out. I think it was yesterday, maybe we want to raise another $15 million through the ATM program. But this is about what's going to happen first, if they run out of liquidity, and they can't find alternative sources of capital. And this could become a very different kind of discussion. But the question that we keep asking ourselves is, how will the studios that have made the shift to producing these high budget films, they're making fewer films today and 60% of what they are making tends to be this high budget movies? How can they replicate the profitability model that they have through the theatrical distribution channel? We can't see that being replicated in PPOD [ph]. So time will tell, but yes, if situations change, and they do go down the path of filing, then we will have to revisit our analysis.\nJohn Massocca: Okay. And then touching on Nate's question from way back earlier in the call, and sorry, if I missed the responses. How does a lockdown a second lockdown in UK potentially impact deal flow? If at all, I mean 2Q UK deal flow fell to little over $50 million. Could that happen again? Or was that moving more reaction to some of the financial market uncertainty and pricing uncertainty rather than structural problems, the closing deals associated with the lockdown?\nSumit Roy: The product that we're pursuing there's plenty of product on the grocery side, there is plenty of product on the single tenant industrial side. So there are funds that are going full cycle, they recognize that there's a market for essential retail, those have continued to do well. So we don't see the product that we are actively pursuing, necessarily dry up, because of the Prime Minister shutting down UK again. And I think, I've made the comments already on the industries that are being shut down. We are not pursuing those in the UK. So that does not impact us. And so I think we'd be okay. And it's a similar story here in the U.S. Even in the midst of the previous lockdown, there was product, I think there was this small window where everything was - there was a slight pause in the market, but then very quickly thereafter the product velocity took off and we started getting really busy, getting inbounds and seeing transactions that we wanted to pursue. So I think it'll be similar. And the big difference between now and then is that operators are better prepared, which doesn't mean that they're not going to feel some pain, but they're just better prepared to handle it. Casual dining is better prepared. Daycare centers are better prepared in terms of the operators, certainly quick service restaurants are better prepared. So I think it's going to be different. And unless there's a mandate that none of these facilities will be allowed to remain open, which could happen, but which a small probability of happening, I think these businesses will be okay.\nJohn Massocca: But is there a potential shift deal flow from maybe 4Q to 1Q or 1Q '21 to 2Q '21?\nSumit Roy: No, actually the 4Q numbers I think are - we are in the beginning of November, it's largely established at this point. So the question will really be if there is some hiccup in the market and sourcing dries up, which again, I want to reiterate, we don't see happening. But if it were to happen, it would probably impact some of first quarter 2021, second quarter 2021. Because you start to build up the portfolio today to close on assets in the first quarter of next year. And so far, so good.\nJohn Massocca: Very helpful. Thank you.\nSumit Roy: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Dennerlein from Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Hey, Sumit. Hope you're well. I was curious about your strategy on the issuing in Sterling debt market going forward. And why you kind of chose that market through the linked bond [ph] issuance?\nSumit Roy: Sure. How are you, Joshua?\nJoshua Dennerlein: Good, fantastic.\nSumit Roy: So I'll tell you, it's very difficult to look at that particular market, when we are buying assets in that market and not match funded with the local currency. For us, it makes perfect sense. And then, obviously, even when we did our first sale leaseback that sort of got us into the UK with Sainsbury's, we try to match fund it with \u00a3300 odd million of local denominated British pounds. And even though we had to go down the 144 path to get there, the reason for doing that was essentially to match fund and not have to worry about trying to enter into cross currency hedges, et cetera, which we did on the remainder. But in doing so we left some economics on the table. And for us, we feel that the product that we are pursuing then has a profile that needs to be warranted with the cost of capital that we can raise there. And we would be a miss if we didn't take advantage of the fact that we have two A credit rating, and we can issue similar tenured paper at potentially 50 basis points, 60 basis points inside of what we can issue here in the U.S. And so our all-in cost was 1.7%. We have assets that have 10-year ship north of 10 years, in fact, on a portfolio basis, it's well north of that. And to be able to match fund it with \u00a3400 million at 1.71% all in costs, that just allows us to create more value for our shareholders. So that was the rationale.\nJonathan Pong: Yes. Josh, I would just add. This is Jonathan. This is something that we were looking to do very early in the year and obviously, the pandemic hit. And we were patient, we weighted towards a point in time where the market covered, there's certainly a dearth of supply in the Sterling bond market. Pricing had recovered to a point where on an indicative basis, we're able to execute well inside of where 10-year U.S. paper would have priced. And then obviously, just the diversification of our investor base on the fixed income side and it's very high-quality order book. That was a strategic goal of ours for quite some time going all the way back to 2019, when we first entered the UK market. So it all kind of came together fairly nicely when it did.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Awesome. I appreciate that guys. I'll leave the floor. Thank you.\nSumit Roy: Thank you, Josh.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income's conference call. I will now turn the call over to Sumit Roy for concluding remarks.\nSumit Roy: Well, thank you everyone for joining us, and I look forward to seeing a lot of you at the upcoming NAREIT conference. Thank you very much. Bye-bye.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Sumit Roy",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrew. Welcome, everyone. As we remain in a remote work environment to promote the safety of our employees and community, I continue to be impressed by the resiliency and talent of our team to drive our business forward through the current pandemic. I also remain appreciative of the support and resiliency of our clients and partners, who continue to perform under difficult circumstances. On the personnel front, we were excited to announce that Christie Kelly has been appointed Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. And we look forward to Christie joining us in January. Christie's depth and breadth of experience with leading real estate companies will be immediately additive to our team. Over the last year she has been a valuable member of our Board of Directors and the Board's Audit Committee, which will further promote a smooth transition. I look forward to partnering with Christie to continue advancing Realty Income's strategy and objectives. Moving on to a summary of the quarter. During the third quarter we invested approximately $659 million in high-quality real estate including $230 million in the UK, which brings us to nearly $1.3 billion invested year-to-date. Investments during the quarter were primarily concentrated in the home improvement, convenience store and grocery store industries, each of which continue to perform well through the current environment. On October 1, we diversified our access and presence in the global capital markets as we closed on our debut public debt issuance of Sterling-denominated notes, raising \u00a3400 million in 10-year notes, with an effective annual yield to maturity of 1.71%. We are grateful for the support we received from the UK fixed income investors community, and we look forward to building on these relationships in the years to come. We took steps to further position our balance sheet for growth during the quarter, as we raised approximately $349 million of equity, primarily through our ATM program. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDAR ratio at quarter end was 5.3 times, which is well within our target leverage ratio, and provides a significant financial flexibility moving forward. Based on the strength of our investment pipeline and our continued access to well priced capital, we're increasing 2020 acquisitions guidance to approximately $2 billion. Moving on to investment activity during the quarter. In the third quarter of 2020, we invested approximately $659 million in 89 properties located in 21 states in the United Kingdom, at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.4%, and with a weighted average lease term of 12.7 years. On a total revenue basis, approximately 73% of total acquisitions during the quarter were from investment grade rated tenants or their subsidiaries. Of the $659 million invested during the quarter, $429 million was invested domestically in 82 properties at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.9%, and with a weighted average lease term of 15.4 years. During the quarter, $230 million was invested internationally in seven properties located in the UK, at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 7.5%, and with a weighted average lease term of 8.9 years. Year-to-date, we have invested approximately $1.3 billion in 180 properties located in 28 States and the UK, at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.3% and with a weighted average lease term of 13.1 years. On a revenue basis, 56% of total acquisitions are from investment grade rated tenants or their subsidiaries. Of the $1.3 billion invested year-to-date $845 million was invested domestically in 167 properties, at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.2% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.8 years. Year-to-date approximately $454 million was invested internationally in 13 properties located in the UK, at weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.4% and with a weighted average lease term of 10 years. Transaction flow remains healthy, as we sourced approximately $14.1 billion in the third quarter. Of this amount, $10 billion was domestic opportunities and $4.1 billion were international opportunities. Of the opportunity source during the third quarter, 53% were portfolios and 47% or approximately $6.7 billion were one-off assets. Year-to-date we sourced approximately $46.6 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of the $659 million in total acquisitions closed in the third quarter, 44% were one-off transactions. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy during the quarter, averaging approximately 164 basis points for domestic investments, and 328 basis points for international investments. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. Our investment pipeline remains robust, and we are well-positioned with strong financial flexibility to capitalize on opportunities going forward, resulting in our increased acquisition guidance. Moving to dispositions, during the quarter we sold 36 properties for net proceeds of $50 million, and we realized an unlevered IRR of 19.7%. This brings us to 65 properties sold year-to-date for $183.6 million at a net cash cap rate of 6.6%. And we realized an unlevered IRR of 13.6%. Our portfolio remains well diversified by tenant, industry, geography and property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At quarter end, our properties were leased to approximately 600 tenants in 51 separate industries located in 49 states, Puerto Rico and the UK. Approximately 85% of rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at over 10% of rental revenue. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 5.8% of rental revenue. Convenience stores remain our largest industry at 12.1% of rental revenue. Within our overall retail portfolio, approximately 95% of our rent comes from tenants with a service non-discretionary and/or low price point component to their business. We believe these characteristics allow our tenants to operate in a variety of economic environments, and to compete more effectively with e-commerce. These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate, where the vast majority of recent U.S. retail bankruptcies have been in industries that do not possess these characteristics. We remain constructive on the credit quality of the portfolio, with approximately half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade rated tenants. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.6%, an increase of 10 basis points versus the prior quarter. During the quarter, we re-leased 80 properties recapturing 99.2% of the expiring rent year-to-date - sorry, year-to-date, we re-leased 238 properties, recapturing 99.8% of the expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold over 3,400 properties with leases expiring, recapturing over 100% of rent on those properties that were re-leased. Rent collection across our portfolio has remained stable. During the third quarter we collected 93.1% of contractual rent due, and we collected 92.9% of contractual rent for the month of October. Further improvements in rent collection percentages is primarily dependent on improvements in the theatre industry, which I will touch on shortly. Our collection rates are calculated as the cash rent collected, divided by the contractual rent charge for the applicable period. Charge amounts have not been adjusted for any COVID-19 related rent relief granted, and do include contractual base rents from any tenants and bankruptcies. We collected 100% of contractual rent for the third quarter from investment grade rated tenants, which further validates the importance of high-quality real estate portfolio leased to large well-capitalized clients. While we have not historically prioritized investment grade rated tenants as a primary objective, during periods of economic uncertainty, high grade credit tenants tend to provide more reliable streams of income as the last three quarters have proven out. Our top four industries, convenience stores, drug stores, grocery stores and dollar stores, each sell essential goods and represent approximately 37% of rental revenue. And we have received nearly all of the contractual rent due to us from tenants in these industries since the pandemic began. Uncollected rent continues to be primarily in the theater and health and fitness industries, as these industries account for approximately 80% of uncollected rents during the third quarter. As we continue to manage our portfolio to support long-term value creation, we believe the breadth and depth of our asset management and real estate operations department, which is our company's largest department is a key competitive advantage vis-a\u0300-vis our competitors. I would also like to update the investment community on our latest views on the theater industry. The industry represents 5.7% of our contractual base rent. And while we do expect the industry to downsize in the future, we continue to believe it will remain a viable industry in a post-pandemic environment, especially for high budget blockbuster movies. As a reminder, U.S. Box Office reached an all-time high as recent as 2018, and 2019 produced the highest grossing worldwide film of all time an Avengers: Endgame. Further, recent reports from China where over 80% of movie theaters are open, show that daily box office revenue has recovered to 2019 levels. Though we acknowledge that cultural nuances do influence theater attendance, it remains a relevant data point. We continue to believe particularly for blockbuster movies, that a theatrical release will be the preferred distribution channel for studios going forward, given the superior economics afforded to them versus the streaming platform. That said, we do recognize that the industry is changing, and that there will likely be a rationalization of theatres in a post-pandemic reality. Under this scenario, underperforming theatres may not survive. Near-term, there are several uncertainties facing the industry particularly around, when the major movie studios will feel comfortable releasing their films through the theatrical distribution channel. And with theaters in New York City and Los Angeles, the two largest markets in the U.S. remaining shuttered, we like others who follow the industry lack clarity as to whether studios will be inclined to release blockbuster films. As a result, our confidence level associated with the collectability of a portion of our outstanding theater receivables has diminished, and the near-term solvency risk facing the two largest operators in the space, AMC and Cineworld is incrementally more pronounced. To that end, we believe it is prudent to establish a full reserve for the outstanding receivable balance for 37 of our 78 total theater assets, and to move to cash accounting for revenue recognition purposes, for these 37 assets going forward. We deemed the collectability of rents for these 37 theater assets to be less than probable, based on a variety of factors including the store level performance of these assets. To be clear, we believe our theater portfolio is one of very high-quality, and we estimate that 82% of theatres in our portfolio are in the top two quartile of each operator's portfolio in terms of store level performance. Specifically, of the 72 theater assets that we have recent unit level financial information on, we estimate that 41 are in the top quartile, 18 are in the second quartile, 11 are in the third quartile, and two are in the bottom quartile, based on pre-pandemic EBITDAR performance. Our criteria to determine which of these assets to move to cash accounting was predicated on a holistic approach, based largely on these productivity rankings on a pre-rent and post-rent basis. We determined that 31 of these assets most of which were still profitable based on pre-pandemic financials, generated EBITDA that prevented us from deeming collection as probable. Of the remaining six assets for which we are reserving, we did not have access to unit level financial information to assess collectability. Thus, as a conservative measure, we reserve for those six assets as well. The financial impact of our theater reserves is $17.2 million of reserves recognized for these 37 assets, $1.6 million of which is straight line rent receivable reserve, and thus has no AFFO impact. The third quarter impact is approximately $0.04 per share diluted to AFFO, and $0.05 per share diluted to FFO. And going forward, we will not accrue revenue on these assets unless we actually collect the cash rent, all we determine collectability has become probable again. During the quarter, we recorded provisions for impairment of approximately $105 million, $79 million of which was associated with 12 theater assets. To arrive at the appropriate impairment for our theater assets, we analyzed the same 37 assets where collection probability was deemed less than probable. Of the 37 assets we analyzed, we determined that 12 assets had a probability weighted undiscounted cash flow that was less than the current net book value of the assets. Accordingly, we impaired the carrying value of these 12 assets down to their estimated fair value. As a reminder, provisions for impairment only impact net income and has no impact on the company's FFO or AFFO. Now I'd like to outline our current thoughts on the long-term outlook for our overall portfolio revenue stream, almost all of which we expect to remain intact in a post-pandemic world. As discussed, we do expect a level of rationalization in the overall theatre industry, which may require repositioning some of our properties. The theaters most likely to be impacted going forward would be a subset of the 37 properties, which we have moved to cash accounting, which in total represent $33.3 million of annual rent, or 2% of our annual rent. To be clear, we do not expect to lose the entirety of rent associated with these properties longer-term, even in the event of potential closures. Beyond the theatre industry, we continue to monitor select tenants in the health and fitness and restaurant industries in particular. Though the overall diversity credit and real estate quality of our portfolio gives us comfort that any longer-term rent loss would be fairly modest. Moving on, our same-store rental revenue decreased 4.4% during the quarter and 1.5% year-to-date. Our reported same-store growth includes deferred rent and unpaid rent that we have deemed to be collectible over the existing lease term, but similarly excludes rent where collectability is deemed less than probable. The decrease in same-store rental revenue is primarily driven by reserves we recognize in the theatre industry, and to a lesser extent the health and fitness industry. I will provide additional detail on our financial results for the quarter starting with the income statement. Our G&A expense as a percentage of rental and other revenue for the quarter was 4.3%. Our year-to-date G&A expense ratio excluding approximately $3.5 million of severance related to the departure of our former CFO was 4.5%. We continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector, reflecting our best in class efficiency and the scale benefits afforded to us given our size. Our non-reimbursable property expense as a percentage of rental and other revenue was 1.9% for the quarter, and 1.5% year-to-date. AFFO per share during the quarter was $0.81, and $2.55 year-to-date. Our AFFO per share for the quarter was negatively impacted by the recording of non-straight line rent reserves of approximately $21.8 million during the quarter, which represented $0.06 per share of dilution. Year-to-date our AFFO per share was negatively impacted by non-straight line rent reserves of approximately $29.3 million, which represents $0.09 per share of dilution. Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we have continued to maintain our conservative capital structure and remain one of only a handful of REITs with at least two A ratings. During the quarter we issued $315 million of notes due 2031 for an effective annual yield to maturity of 2.34%, and subsequent to quarter end, we completed a debut public offering of Sterling denominated senior unsecured notes for \u00a3400 million due 2030, for an effective annual yield to maturity of 1.71%. Additionally, we raised approximately $349 million of equity during the quarter, primarily through our ATM program. Year-to-date, we have raised nearly $2.7 billion of well-priced capital, including approximately $1.22 billion of equity, and $1.47 billion of debt. We ended the quarter with low leverage and strong coverage metrics with net debt to adjusted EBITDAre ratio of 5.3 times, or 5.2 times on a pro forma basis, adjusting for the annualized impact of acquisitions and dispositions during the quarter. And our fixed charge coverage ratio remains strong at 5.2 times. We continue to have very minimal net short-term borrowing, as $856 million outstanding on the line and through our CP program was largely offset with approximately $725 million of cash on hand. Looking forward, our overall debt maturity schedule remains in excellent shape, with less than $80 million of debt maturities through yearend 2021, excluding CP borrowings. And the weighted average maturity of our bonds is a healthy 8.2 years. In summary, our balance sheet is in great shape, and we continue to have no leverage, strong coverage metrics and ample liquidity. In September, we increased the dividend for the 108th time in our company's history. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of approximately 4.5%. And we are proud to be one of only three REITs in the S&P 500 dividend aristocrat's index for having increased their dividend every year, for the last 25 consecutive years. In summary, we are confident in the overall resiliency of our portfolio, and believe our strategy of partnering with large, well-capitalized operators who are leaders in their respective industries will continue to be a successful strategy. The momentum in our investment pipeline, our ample sources of liquidity, and our size and scale position as favorably to capitalize on near-term growth opportunities. At this time, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator? Sure. There's a bunch of questions in there, Nate. So, I'll try to take it one at a time. Look, I think during the second quarter earnings announcement, I had suggested that the pipeline was building up very strong, the sourcing data was incredibly high. And that momentum has continued in the third quarter based on almost $14.5 billion of sourcing. The good news with regards to this sourcing number is that it is fairly well distributed across geographies. I would say $10 billion or two-thirds of it was U.S., one-third is UK. And that mix has been fairly consistent throughout the year of the $47 billion odd that we've sourced. With regards to the product that we are pursuing and what the cap rate environment looks like. It is largely in what will be deemed as essential retail. So grocery stores, home improvement, convenience stores, dollar stores, there continues to be enough product within those sectors, that's keeping us busy. And again, especially on the grocery side, as well as to a lesser extent on the home improvement side, we continue to see both those industries very well represented in the UK. You talked about cap rates or pricing was a specific question. Look, we continue to see pricing cap rates compress, both here in the U.S. as well as in the UK. And this is across asset types, both on the industrial single tenant industrial side, as well as the high-quality retail assets that we are targeting and pursuing. I would say that investment grade rated retail today in the U.S. is in the low 5s to potentially even a four handle for certain assets. And it very rarely gets above a six cap. If you start to look beyond investment grade, yes, you will get in the low 5s to potentially in the low 7s. But there is very few products that we are pursuing that has a seven handle in front of it. And in the UK, the pricing is even more competitive. Especially on the grocery side, you'll find product on the retail side of the equation in the low to sort of 4.2% 4.3% zip code to the mid-5. On the single tenant industrial side across both the U.S. and UK cap rates have compressed, very good product with tenants that we would like to partner with, with long-term leases are trading in the low 4s. So it is a very expensive market. But this is where relationships and previous relationships with tenants and brokers and the folks that control some of the transactions, the developers et cetera that really comes to the forefront. And we feel very good about the pipeline that we've built. It's part of the reason why we were sitting on some cash in recognition of being able to finance right off of our balance sheet. Yes, so I'll answer your UK question first, Nate. Again, what they are shutting down tends to be gyms, movie theaters, casual dining concepts, bars, et cetera. And we have no exposure to any of those industries, say for one theater in the UK. Most of our exposure happens to be in the grocery side of the business, and more recently, in the home improvement side of the business, which is deemed as essential retail and will continue to remain open. And these are the precise industries that have actually experienced tailwinds during this pandemic, because of some of the social distancing and stay at home norms that have been adopted by the consumer base. So, we feel pretty good about our portfolio and its ability to perform in the event of a prolonged shutdown in the UK. Here in the U.S., we've also sort of very much bookended where the risk lies, and it is primarily in the theater business, and that's the reason why we spend so much of the time discussing our thesis and walking you through why we've done what we've done in the theater side of the business. Outside of the theater business, its health and fitness to a lesser extent. And the issue of being able to continue to operate a fitness center at 50% capacity is not an issue in and of itself, because most of the time at the peak capacity levels, they rarely go above that 50%, 55% to begin with. And again, given our main two exposures in the health and fitness businesses to the Lifetime and LA Fitness, they continue to be largely open at this point. And I think in the month of October, we collected 83% of the rent. So, we feel that at least with this particular industry, we bookended the risk fairly well. But, look, if we go into a big shut down, I do think that, some of the other industries that were impacted casual dining, Daycare Centers, et cetera, they are much better equipped to handle a prolonged shutdown today than they were in the month of April. And we feel better about their ability to continue to use some of the avenues that they've created, i.e. click and collect, drive-thru, et cetera, as a method to continue to operate their businesses in a way where they can continue to pay us rent. So, the industry that I feel that is going to be - and it continues to be impacted is the theater industry. But outside of that, I think we feel pretty good about the operators we are exposed to in some of these other industries that that could be impacted. But we feel like they'll fare much better this time around than they did in April. Sure. Yes. Sure, Katie. Look 55% of what we closed were portfolio deals in the third quarter. So, we continue to see a very healthy flow of portfolio transactions. And truth be told, that's what moves the needle for us, especially on the retail side of the equation. But the comment around cap rates continues to be true Katie, even portfolios are trading at more aggressive cap rates than they were six months ago. And we closed on a transaction in the third quarter with a client that we have a very good relationship with, and the cap rate we ended up paying on that particular portfolio was 20 basis points inside of where we did the previous sale leaseback with them on. And then subsequent to that, we've seen cap rates compress even further. And so yes, we have seen a very healthy pipeline of portfolio transactions and some staggeringly large portfolios are out there in the market. And it's public, in terms of, what they are. And so that's a very good situation for a company like ours, where we have the ability to write, do much larger transactions without running into concentration issues, and especially if it is with a relationship client and that has not abated. And it's not just a phenomenon that we're seeing here in the in the U.S. We are seeing portfolio transactions in the UK as well. And in fact, we ended up closing on a portion of a portfolio transaction that we did with one of our very good relationships in the UK in the third quarter as well. And so the momentum that we've been able to generate both here in the U.S. and the UK continues to be very strong. And that's what gives us the confidence of having increased our guidance by $500 million at the midpoint of our previous acquisition guidance. Absolutely, Katie. I mean, we are already up to $186 million. And I think you can expect a similar run rate in the fourth quarter, which will be one of the larger disposition strategies that we've had or disposition amounts that we've had in the recent past. And the commentary on cap rates continues to be true on the disposition side of the equation as well. So of course, these are assets that no longer strategically fit the profile of our optimal portfolio, but there continues to be a market for it. And that's the reason why we were able to achieve such high double digit, high teen type unlevered IRRs, because the market is very conducive to sell into. And we will continue to do that going forward. But again, it's a story of two baskets, if you will. There's definitely a very healthy appetite for all of the industries that I've talked about as being essential retail, and cap rates are incredibly aggressive in that particular bucket. But if you look at assets in the health and fitness business, or if you look at assets in the theater business, there is no market right now. So, yes, we can continue to call our portfolio and evolve towards our optimal portfolio. But it's not a market where you can sell, essentially, any asset that you have, or you desire to sell. So, I think we have to take that into consideration as well. Sure. Yes. So Harsh, I think, in trying to answer Katy's question, I talked about the volume, but I'll get a bit more specific. The assets that we are selling are, there was some grocery assets that we sold with operators that we didn't seem like fit our profile for the long-term, and we're able to get very aggressive pricing. All of the assets sold were here in the U.S. So I just want to make that point very clear. And then there were some assets that we've sold on the convenience store side of the business. And these tend to be formats, that, again, is not what we would be pursuing actively. So these are more like kiosks, 1,500 square feet boxes, with half an acre, with potentially tenants that don't quite have the credit profile that we would like to have long-term, there continues to be a market for those types of products and so we're selling those assets. And then of course, we sell a lot of vacant assets as well in this market. And despite the fact that we are in the midst of a pandemic there continues to be especially for well-located vacant assets, there continues to be an appetite amongst the developer community to come in and buy those fairly aggressively. And so that's the makeup of some of the assets that we've been selling. And another industry that I would throw in there is the restaurant business. So some of the assets that we've sold, happened to be in the restaurant business. Sure. So, the way we sort of went through the analysis, I think I went through it in a fair amount of detail, but I'll just be brief. On the 31 of the 37 assets, they happen to be two of them were in the top quartile of performance, 16 were in the second quartile, 11 in the third quartile, and two in the fourth quartile. And then there were six assets for which we didn't have financial information. And so that's the 37 assets that we deemed, as being ones that in a conservative scenario, if there was going to be rationalization in the theatre business, we couldn't say with a high probability of a collection that we'll be able to collect rent, and so we move them to cash accounting. Of those 37 assets, we did the impairment analysis, because anytime we move to cash accounting that's a trigger for impairment. 12 of those assets were deemed as being impaired. And there are several analyses that we go through when you compare the undiscounted cash flow to the net book value, and if it's less than the net book value, we take an impairment. And so those 12 assets resulted in $79 million of the $105 million of impairment. And then there was another asset that we had an office asset that resulted in about $18 million of impairment. And then that basically constituted the vast majority of the $105 million. The lease terms remaining on the portfolio on the entire theater industry, I think it's in the high single digits for both Regal as well as AMC. Thank you. That's a very good observation, Greg. And because we have very tightly defined parameters for what we are going to pursue in the UK, they tend to fall in one of two buckets, it's either going to be and mostly it's going to be in the grocery side of the equation, or it's going to be home improvement. And those boxes tend to be larger, and they tend to be very well located, they tend to be located in high demographic regions. And they have a price point of right around $30 million to $45 million apart. And then when you supplement that with industrial assets that we are also pursuing, again, very rigid standards. Those will tend to be even higher than that, 2x that in some cases. So that's the product mix that you're going to find us pursuing in the UK. And that's the reason why those price per property points in the UK are going to be much larger. Here in the U.S., obviously, we go after a lot of discrete quick service restaurants, et cetera, which could trade at $1.5 million per part. And so on average the $4 million to $5 million is the average per property that you find here in the U.S., but that's what drives the differences. Sure. And look, I don't want to speak to what our competitors are doing, Greg. But the assets that we are pursuing, with the operators that we are pursuing on the industrial side, yes, we have come across mid-6%, high-6% deals, but for a variety of reasons. And it's largely driven by where these assets are located or the tenant and the credit that the tenant has or the type of business that they are involved in. It just doesn't get us comfortable. And so we walk away from those transactions. The ones that we are pursuing, they happen to be in the zip code that I've shared with you with regards to pricing. And so it has been a bit challenging for us. And thankfully, we've got the cost of capital to pursue some not all of these transactions and that's what we're trying to do is be as clinical as we can, leverage the relationships that we have. But in some cases, pricing gets to a point where we just have to walk away. Sure. Yes, happy to answer that. At the very beginning, I want to say right around June, et cetera, when we were reengaging, I'll tell you that we were amongst the very few that was still active in the acquisitions market. And we certainly took advantage of that. In some cases, we had transactions that we had sort of suspended, just entering into the pandemic, those came back to us. And we were able to transact some of those at slightly higher cap rates, but very, very quickly that scenario has changed. And it has become far more competitive. Even though some of our public peers have not fully engaged in the acquisitions market, there is plenty of capital chasing product on the retail side, which is where the surprise has been. The industrial has been less surprising to us. Even though, over the last six months, we've seen pricing get fairly aggressive. And there, we do see a lot of international money chasing well located long-term leases. But the biggest surprise for us has been on the retail side. The product that we're chasing, it's not surprising that that should attract the preponderance of capital. And we have seen that, and so that I think is the main reason why cap rates have gotten compressed. And now it's pretty aggressive out there. Well, clearly transactions that are occurring. So, we just raised our guidance to $2 billion, approximately $2 billion. And so, this is obviously a testament to the pipeline that we have, transactions that we've already got over the finish line. I think, there's plenty of transactions that will get done. The fixed income market is obviously incredibly - the cost of capital in the fixed income market is incredibly low right now, it's very competitive. And so this is where, our ratings et cetera come into the forefront because if one-third of the financing is coming from there, our overall cost of capital does allow us to continue to play even though the markets have gotten aggressive. Clearly, there was a period where very, very few transactions were getting done. And this is the month of April, which is when everybody was trying to get their arms around the pandemic, et cetera. But I would say that lasted all of four to six weeks, and immediately after that, transactions got done. And they got done at higher levels in the month of June, July than they are getting down today. Yes. Yes. Linda, that's a great question. And I wish I had an answer for you, I can't share with you that those 41 assets are obviously in the top quartile of performance. They all cleared EBITDA, which is post rent obligations, et cetera, north of $1 million per asset. And so, those were the best of the best assets that either of the two large operators have, that's part of our portfolio. And so, as to when can they get back to those levels, I did share with you that in China, even though they have some constraints in capacity, they're already at pre-pandemic levels. This is largely going to be a function of when the studios feel comfortable, releasing these assets to the theaters, and if they keep pushing the high budget content further in and further out, the further out, it will be when these assets when these theaters can generate that $1 million plus of EBITDAs. And right now this on December 24, we still have the Wonder Woman movie that is still scheduled to come out. The James Bond film got moved out to April of next year. If those start to remain, and if the content that has been pushed out next year does come in next year, and we have a vaccine over the next 60 days and people start to feel more comfortable about being able to go back to the theaters, I can see this rebounding fairly quickly. But the question remains there are so many ifs, right, when will the vaccine come out, when will the customers feel confident of coming back. And we have some data points to point to, we also believe that streaming is not going to be the preferred route for these high budget movies, just because the math doesn't play out. And so I think it really is directly tied to when the studios are going to release the content and the customers feel comfortable in being able to go back, and I think that's going to be a function of when we have a vaccine available. So, if those play out, I think very quickly thereafter, I can see these assets starting to go north of $1 million again. So a lot of these assets we have basically constructed through sale leasebacks that we entered into with both Regal as well as with AMC. And these were assets that AMC and Regal used to own on their balance sheet. And so they tend to be the better performing assets anyway. And what we have continue to do is to invest, we invested with them when they change the format to accommodate the better seating and the stadium seating and the food and beverage, et cetera. And as part of that, we entered into percentage rent, participation with some of these operators. And so, I don't have the precise number in terms of how many of these assets are on percentage rent, but I do know that, as part of entering into a capital contribution to repurpose some of these assets, we did have percentage rental. Yes, and that's why we continue to be positively surprised, Linda. So, unsolicited, we received some feedback on one of our theater assets where a developer shared with us that it could be positioned to a mixed-use multifamily side, it's very well located. Another one was identified as a potential last mile distribution center, because these tend to be 12, 13 acres parcels and so you could easily create 100,000 square foot last mile distribution center. Now, of course, you have to go through zoning, et cetera. But we feel that, because of where these assets are located, they can be repositioned and we will come out. Okay, it's just a matter of time and commitment and capital commitment. But unsolicited, the feedback we've received so far, because people are all tracking what's happening in the theatre business. We feel that we've come out okay, in the event that we need to position some of these assets. Sure. Hi, John, how are you? Good. Yes. Look, if they cease to exist, there is no doubt. They file Chapter 11. Chapter 11 filing in and of itself is not a triggering event. It's just like, what are they planning and doing? What's their path forward? But if it switches over into Chapter 7, then clearly, we're going to write off even the 41 assets that is not on cash accounting, right now, we immediately shift to cash accounting on that. So that's the quick answer on what you just suggested. And that is the reason why we are continuing to monitor AMC came out. I think it was yesterday, maybe we want to raise another $15 million through the ATM program. But this is about what's going to happen first, if they run out of liquidity, and they can't find alternative sources of capital. And this could become a very different kind of discussion. But the question that we keep asking ourselves is, how will the studios that have made the shift to producing these high budget films, they're making fewer films today and 60% of what they are making tends to be this high budget movies? How can they replicate the profitability model that they have through the theatrical distribution channel? We can't see that being replicated in PPOD [ph]. So time will tell, but yes, if situations change, and they do go down the path of filing, then we will have to revisit our analysis. The product that we're pursuing there's plenty of product on the grocery side, there is plenty of product on the single tenant industrial side. So there are funds that are going full cycle, they recognize that there's a market for essential retail, those have continued to do well. So we don't see the product that we are actively pursuing, necessarily dry up, because of the Prime Minister shutting down UK again. And I think, I've made the comments already on the industries that are being shut down. We are not pursuing those in the UK. So that does not impact us. And so I think we'd be okay. And it's a similar story here in the U.S. Even in the midst of the previous lockdown, there was product, I think there was this small window where everything was - there was a slight pause in the market, but then very quickly thereafter the product velocity took off and we started getting really busy, getting inbounds and seeing transactions that we wanted to pursue. So I think it'll be similar. And the big difference between now and then is that operators are better prepared, which doesn't mean that they're not going to feel some pain, but they're just better prepared to handle it. Casual dining is better prepared. Daycare centers are better prepared in terms of the operators, certainly quick service restaurants are better prepared. So I think it's going to be different. And unless there's a mandate that none of these facilities will be allowed to remain open, which could happen, but which a small probability of happening, I think these businesses will be okay. No, actually the 4Q numbers I think are - we are in the beginning of November, it's largely established at this point. So the question will really be if there is some hiccup in the market and sourcing dries up, which again, I want to reiterate, we don't see happening. But if it were to happen, it would probably impact some of first quarter 2021, second quarter 2021. Because you start to build up the portfolio today to close on assets in the first quarter of next year. And so far, so good. Sure. Sure. How are you, Joshua? So I'll tell you, it's very difficult to look at that particular market, when we are buying assets in that market and not match funded with the local currency. For us, it makes perfect sense. And then, obviously, even when we did our first sale leaseback that sort of got us into the UK with Sainsbury's, we try to match fund it with \u00a3300 odd million of local denominated British pounds. And even though we had to go down the 144 path to get there, the reason for doing that was essentially to match fund and not have to worry about trying to enter into cross currency hedges, et cetera, which we did on the remainder. But in doing so we left some economics on the table. And for us, we feel that the product that we are pursuing then has a profile that needs to be warranted with the cost of capital that we can raise there. And we would be a miss if we didn't take advantage of the fact that we have two A credit rating, and we can issue similar tenured paper at potentially 50 basis points, 60 basis points inside of what we can issue here in the U.S. And so our all-in cost was 1.7%. We have assets that have 10-year ship north of 10 years, in fact, on a portfolio basis, it's well north of that. And to be able to match fund it with \u00a3400 million at 1.71% all in costs, that just allows us to create more value for our shareholders. So that was the rationale. Thank you, Josh. Well, thank you everyone for joining us, and I look forward to seeing a lot of you at the upcoming NAREIT conference. Thank you very much. Bye-bye."

And we were patient, we weighted towards a point in time where the market covered, there's certainly a dearth of supply in the Sterling bond market. Pricing had recovered to a point where on an indicative basis, we're able to execute well inside of where 10-year U.S. paper would have priced. And then obviously, just the diversification of our investor base on the fixed income side and it's very high-quality order book. That was a strategic goal of ours for quite some time going all the way back to 2019, when we first entered the UK market. So it all kind of came together fairly nicely when it did."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Realty Income Second Quarter 2020 Operating Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would turn the call over to Mr. Andrew Crum, Associate Director of Realty Income. You may begin.\nAndrew Crum: Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income\u2019s second quarter 2020 operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jonathan Pong, Senior Vice President, Head of Capital Markets and Finance. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The company\u2019s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company\u2019s Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two question when they turning to Q&A portion of the call, in order to get everyone the opportunity to participate. If you\u2019d like to ask additional questions, you may re-enter the queue. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy.\nSumit Roy: Thanks, Andrew. Welcome, everyone. I\u2019d like to start by expressing my gratitude and appreciation towards my colleagues, whose resiliency and determination to remaining extremely productive in the face of the current pandemic continues to drive our business. We are one team, and all employees have embraced this concept through effective communication and collaboration while working remotely. Further, we empathize with the individuals and businesses impacted by COVID-19 and we continue to partner with our clients to seek mutually beneficial outcomes. Our operating results for the second quarter continue to demonstrate the stability and resiliency of our business as we generated AFFO per share of $0.86 and ended the quarter with a portfolio occupancy of 98.5%. During the quarter, we invested over $154 million in high-quality real estate, including $58 million invested internationally in the UK, which brings us to $640 million invested year-to-date. Our quarter end to date \u2013 end net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 5.1 times positions us well going forward with significant financial flexibility. While uncertainty remains due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our business, which primarily focuses on owning real estate leased to essential retail and industrial tenants continues to perform well. Rent collection since hitting a low of 84.9% in May has steadily improved. And as of July 31, we have collected 86.5% of contractual rent for the second quarter. We have collected 99.1% of contractual rent for the second quarter from investment-grade-rated tenants, which further validates the importance of a high-quality real estate portfolio leads to large, well capitalized clients. While we have not historically prioritized investment-grade-rated tenants as a primary objective, during the periods of economic uncertainty, high-grade credit tenants tend to provide more reliable streams of income as the last few months have proven out. For the month of July, we have collected 91.5% of contractual rent, which represents the second consecutive month of improved rent collection and the highest monthly rent collection since the pandemic began. Uncollected rent continues to be primarily in the theater, health and fitness and restaurant industries as these industries account for approximately 81% of uncollected rent during the second quarter. Importantly, we continue to expect to collect the vast majority of uncollected rent as we continue to consider and negotiate rent deferral agreements on a case-by-case basis. We disclosed in our financial supplement the percentage of contractual rent collected by industry. Our top four industries: convenience stores, drug stores, dollar stores and grocery stores, each sell essential goods and represents approximately 37% of rental revenue. And we have received almost all of the contractual rent due to us from tenants in these industries for the second quarter. Other industries, such as theaters, health and fitness and restaurants have been challenged due to store closures and social distancing guidelines, but we are encouraged by improved rent collection in recent months. We remain constructive on the long-term viability of these industries, particularly given our partnership with the top operators in each of these verticals. The success of the theater industry has largely been tied to the quality of films produced by Hollywood, and the U.S. box office reached an all-time high as recently as 2018. Additionally, the economic business model for studios continues to suggest, in our view, that the theater distribution channel will remain attractive going forward. We also expect the non-discretionary and low price point propositions of the quick service restaurant and health and fitness industries to support resiliency of their rent paying capabilities, particularly as their businesses begin to reopen in certain areas of the country. As we continue to manage our portfolio to support long-term value creation, we believe the breadth and depth of our asset management and real estate operations department, which is our company\u2019s largest department, is a key competitive advantage vis-a-vis our competitors. Moving on to investment activity during the first quarter. In the second quarter of 2020, we invested approximately $154 million in 32 properties located in 15 states and the United Kingdom at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of a 6.3% and with a weighted average lease term of 11.8 years. On a total revenue basis, approximately 41% of total acquisitions during the quarter were from investment-grade-rated tenants. 100% of the revenues were generated from retail tenants. These assets are leased to 14 different tenants in eight industries. We closed six discrete transactions in the second quarter and approximately 9% of second quarter investment volume for sale-leaseback transactions. Of the $154 million invested during the quarter, $96 million were invested domestically in 30 properties at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.5% and with a weighted average lease term of 12.8 years. During the quarter, $58 million was invested internationally in two properties located in the UK at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.1% and with a weighted average lease term of 9.9 years. Year-to-date, we\u2019ve invested $640 million in 94 properties located in 25 states in the United Kingdom at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.1% and with a weighted average initial lease term of 13.6 years. On a revenue basis, 37% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade-rated tenants, 97% of the revenues are generated from retail and 3% are from industrial assets. These assets are leased to 29 different tenants in 17 industries. We closed 23 independent transactions year-to-date and approximately 22% of year-to-date investment volume for a sale-leaseback transaction. Of the $640 million invested year-to-date, $416 million was invested domestically in 88 properties at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.5% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.3 years. Year-to-date, approximately $224 million was invested internationally in six properties located in the UK at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.3% and with a weighted average lease term of 11.8 years. Transaction flow remains healthy as we sourced approximately $14.5 billion in the second quarter. Of the $14.5 billion sourced during the quarter, $9 billion was domestic opportunities and $5.5 billion were international opportunities. Investment-grade opportunities represented 65% of the volume sourced for the second quarter. Of the opportunities sourced during the second quarter, 55% were portfolios and 45% or approximately $6.5 billion were one-off assets. Year-to-date, we sourced approximately $32.6 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of these opportunities, $19.3 billion were domestic opportunities and $13.3 billion were international opportunities. Investment-grade opportunities represented 49% of the volume sourced year-to-date. Of the $32.6 billion sourced year-to-date, 56% were portfolios and 44% were one-off assets. Of the $154 million in total acquisitions closed in the second quarter, 41% were one-off transactions. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital during the quarter averaged approximately 131 basis points. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. Looking forward, our investment pipeline remains robust, and we are well positioned with strong financial flexibility. Accordingly, we are reinstating 2020 acquisition guidance with a range of $1.25 billion to $1.75 billion. Moving on to dispositions. During the quarter, we sold 12 properties for net proceeds of $7.4 million and we realized an unlevered IRR of 6.1%. This brings us to 29 properties sold year-to-date for $133.6 million at a net cash cap rate of 6.2% and we realized an unlevered IRR of 10.5%. Our portfolio is well diversified by tenant, industry, geography and property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At quarter end, our properties were leased to approximately 600 tenants in 50 different industries located in 49 states, Puerto Rico and the UK. 84% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at approximately 11% of rental revenue. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6% rental revenue. Convenience stores remains our largest industry at 12% of rental revenue. Within our overall retail portfolio, approximately 95% of our rent comes from tenants with a service non-discretionary and/or low price point component to their business. We continue to believe these characteristics allow our tenants to operate in a variety of economic environments and to compete more effectively with e-commerce. These factors have been particularly relevant in today\u2019s retail climate, where the vast majority of recent U.S. retailer bankruptcies have been in industries that do not possess these characteristics. We continue to feel good about the credit quality in the portfolio with approximately half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment-grade-rated tenants. The weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties is 2.7 times on a four-wall basis, while the median is 2.5 times. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.5%, consistent with the prior quarter. During the quarter, we released 65 properties, recapturing 101.4% of the expiring rent. During the first half of 2020, we released 158 properties recapturing 100.1% of expiring rents. Since our listing in 1994, we have released or sold over 3,300 properties with leases expiring, recapturing over 100% of rent on those properties that were released. Our same-store rental revenue decreased 0.4% during the quarter and 0.2% year-to-date. Our reported same-store growth includes deferred rent and unpaid rent that we have deemed to be collectible over the existing lease term. The decrease in same-store rental revenue is primarily driven by write-offs, we recognized in the restaurant industry as well as partially due to a change in methodology, as we are now recognizing percentage rent during the period it is accrued rather than during the period it is paid. Moving on, I\u2019ll provide additional detail on our financial results for the quarter, starting with income statement. Our G&A expense as a percentage of rental and other revenue for the quarter was 4.8%. Our year-to-date G&A expense ratio excluding approximately $3.5 million severance related to the departure of our former CFO, was 4.6%. We continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector, reflecting our best in class efficiency and the scale benefits afforded to us given our size. Our non-reimbursable property expenses as a percentage of rental and other revenue was 1.4% for both the quarter and year-to-date periods. AFFO per share during the quarter was $0.86, which includes approximately $60.2 million or $0.17 per share on a fully diluted basis of deferred and unpaid rent that we deemed earned during the period and probable of being collected during the existing lease term. Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we have continued to maintain our conservative capital structure and remain only a handful of REITs with at least two A ratings. During the quarter, we issued $600 million of senior unsecured notes due 2031 within effective yield to maturity of 3.36%. And subsequent to quarter end, we add an additional $315 million at an effective yield to maturity of 2.34% blending out to just shy of 3% for the entire $950 million of notes. Additionally, we raised approximately $98.1 million of equity during the quarter, primarily through our ATM program. Year-to-date, we have raised over $1.8 billion of well-priced capital, including approximately $874 million of equity and $950 million of debt. We ended the quarter with low leverage and strong coverage metrics, but the net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 5.1 times and the fixed charge coverage ratio of 5.4 times. We continue to have very strong liquidity with approximately $400 million of cash on hand and $2.5 billion available under our revolving credit facility as of July 31, which provides us significant financial flexibility. Looking forward, overall debt maturity schedule remains in excellent shape, as a weighted average maturity of a bond is 8.3 years. Additionally, we have nest in $140 million of debt coming due through 2021. In summary, our balance sheet is in great shape and we continue to have low leverage, strong coverage metrics and ample liquidity. In June, we increase the dividend for the 107 time in our company\u2019s history. We have increased our dividend every year since the company\u2019s listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of approximately 4.5%. And we are proud to be one of only three REITs in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, but having increase the dividend every year for the last 25 consecutive years. Moving on, we have always managed the business with a focus on economic resiliency and generating stable and increasing cash flow through a variety of economic environments. And we continue to do so through the current climate of uncertainty driven by COVID-19. We deliberately designed a high quality real estate portfolio leased primarily to tenants providing non-discretionary or low price point goods or services, as well as with the focus on partnering with large well-capitalized operators who are leaders in their respective industries. Our judicious balance sheet management and the strength of our financial position are evidenced by 2A credit ratings and our current financial flexibility and liquidity positions us favorably to capitalize and growing opportunities going forward. And we have reinstated 2020 acquisitions guidance with a range of $1.25 billion to $1.75 billion. At this time, I\u2019d like to open it up for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Shivani Sood from Deutsche Bank.\nShivani Sood: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Touching on the investment pipeline, I\u2019m just curious, in terms of potential acquisitions, the depth of the buyer pool that you\u2019re seeing out there in terms of competition. And how it compares to pre-COVID levels? I guess, is it mostly public buyers or private and has it been different for larger portfolio transaction?\nSumit Roy: Yes, it\u2019s a very good question, Shivani. The way to answer it is, for the high quality essential retail product, the competition for that product remains fierce. And in fact, it\u2019s translating into cap rates that I would say has tightened vis-\u00e0-vis pre-COVID levels. And so in terms of number of potential buyers, looking at that product continues to be very strong. I would say that we don\u2019t see as many public net lease companies in the space today. And this is an overall comment as we did pre-COVID. But given what we\u2019ve heard in the recent second quarter earnings announcement, I expect that that\u2019s going to change. But at least over the second quarter and in transactions that we pursued more recently, the number of public buyers tend to be less. On the international side, however, the number of buyers and most of the time we\u2019re competing with private institutes has continued to be very strong. And in fact, there have been occasions where we walked away from transactions that were right down the fairway for us, but because of pricing getting very, very competitive. So in general, I would say that all the products that we are pursuing the competition remains strong and I expect that most of the public net lease buyers are going to stop playing in that space sooner now.\nShivani Sood: And then as a follow-up, in terms of the reinstated investment guidance, could that strengthen the UK markets suggest that more those investment volumes to be sourced in the U.S. versus the UK. Thank you.\nSumit Roy: Sure. Look, I think the UK market and I\u2019d say the overall European market has continued to be a very strong source of growth for us. There were about $650 million worth of sale lease back opportunities that basically take all of the criteria that you\u2019d be looking for outside of pricing. And given our disciplined approach to acquisitions, we chose to not continue to pursue those transactions. And if you look at the sourcing numbers, of the $34 billion, $13 billion was \u2013 has been sourced internationally. And that is well above what we had originally anticipated when we went into the UK market. And so the product remains strong in the international markets. I would say that even here in the U.S., our sourcing numbers is a testament to it. There remains plenty of products, both on the sale lease back side of the equation, as well as on the one off market. And the reason why we felt very comfortable reinstating our acquisition guidance is a testament to the pipeline that we currently have. The discussions that we currently have with our relationship tenants and what we are seeing on the sourcing side of the equation.\nShivani Sood: Thanks very much for that color.\nSumit Roy: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Nate Crossett with Berenberg.\nNate Crossett: Can you guys hear me?\nSumit Roy: There\u2019s a bit of static, but we can hear you.\nNate Crossett: You guys mentioned that you\u2019ve seen some tightening for the high quality product. Obviously, you guys have a lot of it. I\u2019m just wondering if you guys are considering selling some of it into this attractive pricing and maybe you\u2019re redeploying that capital elsewhere.\nSumit Roy: Look, our business philosophy has been that the products that we like we would like to hold it forever, and I\u2019m being a bit facetious there. But the idea being that, trying to time the market and sell when we believe that the cap rates are low and et cetera. Doesn\u2019t always play out and our history has proven that if we hold onto assets and continue to work with our partners or whom these assets are deemed critical, we will create value and we will create value with less volatility and of equivalent nominal terms. And that has sort of proven out to be the case, but that\u2019s not to say that opportunistically, we won\u2019t take advantage of the market like we did in the first quarter, where on the consumer electronic side of the business, we decided to sell the assets back to our tenants with whom we were having discussions of looking at other opportunities. But also looking to, to potentially help them address some of their own objectives, and we were able to generate 11% unlevered IRR based on selling those assets back. But our philosophy is, let\u2019s buy the assets that work for our tenants. Let\u2019s get into very long-term leases with minimal to zero capital invested in those assets. And we will create value, especially, if it continues to work for our tenants. And that continues to be our philosophy.\nNate Crossett: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just one on the pipeline, I was wondering, if you guys could just give a little color on how much of it is retail versus industrial. And then The same in the UK, you mentioned $13 billion sourcing, just curious how much of that is retail versus industrial?\nSumit Roy: Yes. I would say the vast majority is retail. It\u2019s not to say that we are not seeing industrial. Those are the only two products that we are really looking at right now, Nate. But I would say, anywhere between 60% to 70% of what we are sourcing is on the retail side of the ledger. And 30% to 40% is going to be on the industrial side. Look, it\u2019s no secret. We want to grow the industrial portion of our asset type. It\u2019s something that we are very much focused on. We have made a concerted effort to cultivate relationships with folks, who could potentially provide us with this product. And it is starting to take shape and we are being able to generate some transaction flow from that side of the business, but what\u2019s keeps us a little bit on the sidelines, continues to be the fact that our cost of capital is not quite where it was four months ago. And if that were no longer a constraint in terms of the product itself and what\u2019s available. There is plenty of very good product in the industries that we want to participate in with operators that we would love to grow our relationship with. And so yes, it\u2019s about 60% to 70%, 30% to 40% is the split.\nNate Crossett: Okay. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Christy McElroy with Citi.\nChristy McElroy: Hi, thank you so much. Sumit, just a follow-up on those comments and your comments on balance sheet and capital raising. Just in terms of your desire to do more of these deals. From a capital raising standpoint, you recently issued debt, you did an equity raise earlier this year or you just did some more on the ATM, but you tend to run at a conservative leverage level. So as you think about doing more deals and you mentioned cost of capital just from a funding standpoint, what should we expect in terms of further equity raises in the context of your guidance?\nSumit Roy: Yes, that\u2019s a good question, Christy. We believe that we can get to the midpoint of our guidance without having to necessarily rely upon the equity market \u2013 the capital markets. And still stay within what we would deem as conservative what our rating agencies would deem as being in line with the ratings that we have. Having said that, our hope is that with continued positive results on the operating side of the business and continuing to post information that will allow our cost of equity to improve that opportunistically, we will be happy to continue to raise equity capital. But the point I want to leave you with is, we don\u2019t have to do that. Part of the reason why we entered 2011 and we did the very large equity raise was to get in a situation, where we had created enough of a capacity and had under leveraged our balance sheet coming out in March, where if we needed to lean on the debt capital markets, which seem to have corrected a lot sooner than the equity markets have, we could lean on that side of the equation and still stay within levels that, that our rating agencies would continue to support the 2 A ratings. So that\u2019s where we are.\nChristy McElroy: And then just to follow-up on your comments on theater. Just to two things really, how much of the theater and non-payment of rents could ultimately turn into vacancy in your view. And then just from a broader perspective, you talked about the economic model, what are your thoughts on that economic model changing in light of the recent AMC universal deal and other deals that could follow that in terms of theater operator\u2019s ability to pay the kind of rent that they\u2019re paying today?\nSumit Roy: Yes. Look, let\u2019s talk about AMC. We\u2019ve just agreed to terms of AMC. They started paying partial rent in the month of July, which was a very good signal to us. We\u2019ve entered into a payback on the deferred rent that we\u2019ve entered into. And the payback is going to be longer. It\u2019s going to have \u2013 the average payback is going to be 2.7 years. But the fact that we were able to enter into an agreement with AMC, the fact that they were able to start paying us rent for the month of July. These are good signs. Look, we\u2019re seeing the same thing that you\u2019re seeing. The advantage that we have is we can pick up the phone and we can have a conversation with the AMC. And what they\u2019ve shared with us with regards to the agreement that they\u2019ve entered into with Universal is the basic premise for them doing this. Was that they believe that within the first 17 days, they get 75% to 90% of the box office revenues. And for the blockbusters, they generate 90% of the receipts within the first three weeks. So they didn\u2019t believe that there would be significant cannibalization since the movie will be advertised as PVOD only after the first two weeks of the theatrical release. And the fact that they also get a share of the PVOD revenues is another source of revenue stream that gave them comfort. But the basic premise was that the economic pie in entering into this sort of an agreement is actually going to increase for both parties. And so listen, time will tell, we\u2019ve run our own scenarios based on the information that AMC has shared. And at the corporate level, we believe that, they\u2019ll be either at 0% to negative 5% of the profitability creating this arrangement. And so we\u2019ll see. But they at least feel confident enough to have entered into an agreement with us. They started paying showing \u2013 they\u2019ve started paying rent for the month of July partial rent. But all of that continues to help support the thesis that we have that the AMC should come out, okay. Based on our own independent analysis, Christy, we think that they will be fine through November, even in the scenario where they have zero openings. And then obviously if we \u2013 if this slowdown continues and more and more theaters are shut down or they\u2019re unable to open that theaters as they\u2019ve shared with us, which is August 20th, they would like to start opening up some of their theaters. Then of course, there\u2019s a chance that they\u2019ll might come back and ask for more different grants. But that\u2019s the way we are currently. And this is an analysis that we are doing on a month to month basis, which is primarily the reason why we took the $8.5 million of write-off for the second quarter. So we continue to believe that this is from an industry perspective, the theater business is a sound business, but certainly going forward, if you look at our overall portfolio, we are revisiting in terms of what percentage of our overall portfolio should theaters constitute.\nMichael Bilerman: But Sumit, don\u2019t you \u2013 it\u2019s Michael Bilerman speaking. You don\u2019t share in the revenues that when I am going to stream the Universal movie in my house, there is a certain percentage of the revenues that this industry is producing that as a landlord to the box you don\u2019t have, right? So doesn\u2019t it ultimately diminish the value of a feed or a box that you own, right? So shouldn\u2019t it have a higher cap rate and lower rent? Just because the revenues that are going to be generated in that box are not what they used to be? Putting aside the whole COVID thing, right? This just \u2013 this goes to the original issue with theaters, which was PVOD was increasing. And now we\u2019ve had a massive change going from 75 to 17 days that nobody expected.\nSumit Roy: Yes. And Michael, that might turn out to be exactly the case. And from a theater perspective, I think you\u2019re right. The actual box will potentially be generating less profitability for EMC, the corporate. But here\u2019s the other piece that I want us to contemplate. And listen, these are all pieces that we are putting out and we are trying to run numbers, et cetera. But if you look at the math associated with something that is shown in the theater versus PVOD, even for the studios, the math is not going to pencil if it is PVOD only. The vast majority of their profitability comes from getting that 55% to 60% of revenues that are generated at the theaters. And it is much more for these big blockbuster movies, which tends to be where Hollywood is migrating towards. And I think this arrangement is more for movies that potentially are not quite as popular, its lower budget, how do we continue to maximize the revenue and perhaps PVOD is a better way to maximize that piece of movies that are being generated by studios. And so really, based on the conversations, we\u2019ve had, the idea here is that this is going to allow the studios to become more profitable, but it should also at the very least make theaters at the corporate level. Either home or potentially participate in some upside. And at least, the studios become healthier. They\u2019ll be able to generate better movies and be able to generate big tent movies, and that should translate to better content for the theater industry. But this is a thesis. So I get your concern, Michael. We are following this very closely and we\u2019ll see how all of this plays out.\nMichael Bilerman: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Nick Yulico with Scotiabank.\nNick Yulico: This is Greg McGinniss on with Nick. Sumit, the guiding level of acquisitions, inclusive or exclusive of any potential portfolio deals. And how do you think about your ability to underwrite those $200 million plus transactions given the number of tenants and leases in this more uncertain environment?\nSumit Roy: Yes. So even where we are today, Nick, I think we feel you\u2019re not super excited about our cost of equity, but our overall cost of capital still will allow us to continue to chase transactions that we otherwise believe checks all of the boxes. In terms of the industries, we want to focus on the operators within those industries, we want to be in and the real estate asset type. And that hasn\u2019t changed. What gave us confidence in being able to put out the acquisition numbers was really our pipeline. And the number of inbounds that we started to get over the last two and a half, three months. And the fact that, the volatility that was that we saw earlier on in the quarter, where our stock could move 8%, 9% on a day that seems to have gotten a bit more benign. It gave us the confidence to be able to go out and say, based on the pipeline we\u2019ve created, based on the discussions we having, that we\u2019ll be able to hit that $1.25 billion to $1.75 billion acquisition number. And our ability to do $200 million portfolio deals has not changed and the fact that we are today under leveraged. I think allows us to not have to rely on the most volatile of biggest component of our capital stack, which is equity. We can just lean on the debt side of the equation, it seems to have normalized considerably since the earlier month. And be able to finance our acquisition. So having that optionality is obviously what gave us a confidence to be able to go out with a number that we feel likely to need.\nNick Yulico: Okay. So the portfolio deals may be included within the guidance number at this point.\nSumit Roy: Absolutely. Sorry. I didn\u2019t answer that directly. That\u2019s correct.\nNick Yulico: Okay. Thanks. Shifting gears a little bit, just given the current presidential polls by looking to go after 1031 exchanges and the tax plan. Would you expect the removal of white kind exchanges to have a measurable impact on the business or maybe the types of assets that you look to acquire?\nSumit Roy: I wouldn\u2019t use the word measurable, but yes on the margin, do I expect you to have an impact, absolutely. We don\u2019t necessarily compete with 1031 buyers too much maybe on the quick service restaurant side of the business. We will run into some of these buyers on a one off transaction, but by and large, we are buying portfolios, even smaller portfolio transactions. And we have all of the usual suspects that are not 1031, who play in that market. Then switching over to the disposition market. Most of our dispositions tend to be vacant assets and you don\u2019t see 1031 buyers playing in that particular market. It tends to be developers or tenants who want to own their own space, who tend to play in that particular market. So the only area where we might see them is sending occupied assets on a one off basis. And that doesn\u2019t end to be a big part of our overall portfolio.\nNick Yulico: Great. Thank you.\nSumit Roy: Sure.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Spenser Allaway with Green Street Advisors.\nSpenser Allaway: Thank you. In terms of the rent deferrals, you guys granted to tenants so far this year. Has any of the terms changed since first negotiated and/or have any tenants indicated that they would be paying back run ahead of the original payback period?\nSumit Roy: Yes, actually \u2013 so I\u2019ll answer your first question. Second part of your question first, Spenser, that\u2019s, okay. We\u2019ve been sharing our monthly collection information pretty much on a monthly basis. And if you recall, when we first came out with April rents we had said it was 82.9% today. It\u2019s tracking at 88.4% for me rented with a similar trend. We originally came up with 82%. Today, it\u2019s at 84.9%. But similarly with June, we were at 85.7% and today it\u2019s at 86.1%. So in each one of these months, what happened was we\u2019ve had some of our tenants who went back and made us home. Some of them were on from the, on the restaurant side of the equation. Some of them were health and fitness businesses, and some were data centers that basically decided to make us hold for the month of April, may and June. So that\u2019s certainly happened where initially we thought we may have to pursue deferment agreements with some of these tenants. And they came back because the business has opened earlier than they expected and/or they felt better about the liquidity situation and decided to make us home. With respect to the first part of your question, Spenser around, did we have to alter the leases, the vast majority of what we have entered into, which is that $14 million worth of rent of the total $16 million that we entered into an agreement has been done without having to make amendments to the lease itself to the original lease term. And so that is the main reason why, we are being able to stay within the accounting rules to view these as different rents. So we haven\u2019t had to sort of request a longer duration or a payback, et cetera. We expect to be paid back during the original lease term, and therefore we didn\u2019t have to enter into any of lease modification. And that is a similar story on the remaining $46 million that we have entered into discussions with. Now around the edges, there have been some tenants where they requested a longer payback period, which went beyond the original lease term. And those have obviously been \u2013 they are not part of the deferred rent agreements, which didn\u2019t result in a lease amendment. And so \u2013 but that\u2019s a very, very small percentage. The vast majority has been with \u2013 without having to make amendments to the lease itself.\nSpenser Allaway: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Todd Stender with Wells Fargo.\nTodd Stender: Thanks. Sumit, if I heard you right, it sounds like you walked away from a portfolio transaction in the quarter. Just if I heard that right, just getting a sense of maybe what the cap rate was on that to see how low is too low for you guys? And maybe what the investment spread, just wasn\u2019t there.\nSumit Roy: Yes. Todd. Actually, there were a couple of transactions there in the $650 million that I talked about. Both were international and they were both products that we would have absolutely love to have owned. I don\u2019t want to speak to the specific cap rates because these are fairly large transactions. And if you do some amount of research, you\u2019ll be able to figure them out. And one\u2019s not public yet. So \u2013 but what I will say is if you look at, I\u2019ll answer your question slightly differently, Todd, if you look at the spreads we are making, we made about $135 million \u2013 135 basis points of spreads, which was 15 basis points inside of our average spread that we\u2019ve made in the history of our acquisitions. And so the point I want to make is, yes, we are willing to make smaller spread, but not to a point, which does not justify day one having enough of a positive uplift from these investments and take into account some of the risks that are inherent in these investments, though, if you look at the industry, you look at the operator, these are the types of businesses and operators that you feel a very high level of confidence that not only will they make it through the initial lease term, but will continue to operate these businesses post their initial lease term, and these lease terms tend to be 15 years to 20 years. So \u2013 but we have \u2013 we\u2019ve done up to 131 of basis point spread. So we are certainly willing to go south of what our average spread has been, but there is a point beyond which we won\u2019t go.\nTodd Stender: Got it, okay. Thank you. And I\u2019m not sure if I missed this, but just looking at the \u2013 when we look at the same-store revenue growth, quick service restaurants is what created the biggest hit. I wouldn\u2019t have guessed that, but maybe casual dining to that degree, but maybe just flesh out what happened there within QSR?\nSumit Roy: Sure. So there are a couple of operators that constituted the biggest chunk of that write-off. One\u2019s NPC that filed BK. And another one is continuing to pay rent, but it\u2019s just one that we feel we don\u2019t have the same level of confidence. And this is a name that has been on our watch list for over a year now. And in fact, they did end up paying July rent. But nevertheless, we feel like our level of confidence doesn\u2019t quite meet that 75% collectibility threshold, and so we decided to write those off. And so that\u2019s \u2013 those are the two names that constitute the QSR piece of the write-off.\nTodd Stender: Okay, thank you.\nSumit Roy: Sure.\nOperator: And our next question comes from John Massocca with Ladenburg Thalmann.\nJohn Massocca: Yes. So apologies if I missed this in the prepared remarks, but as you look into July, how much of the uncollected rent was deferred and how much was kind of not subject to an agreement? And are there any industries that are driving this portion and was it deferred?\nSumit Roy: Yes. We did not share with you, John, what the results are for July in terms of our negotiation. What I have shared with you is of the 86.5% that we collected for the second quarter, i.e. the 13.5% that remained uncollected, 9% of that is basically that $46.2 million that we\u2019ve shared with you in terms of rent that we are in the midst of negotiating. There isn\u2019t an agreement in place. $14.1 million or approximately 3% are our negotiations that have completed or are very close to being penciled. And then the remaining 1.3% of that 13.5% uncollected was written off. So that\u2019s the \u2013 those are the three buckets of that 13.5% that we didn\u2019t collect for the second quarter. We haven\u2019t shared for the month of July, the 8.5% of uncollected, what\u2019s the breakup there. But those numbers, obviously, the \u2013 what was being negotiated, that number has reduced because some of those negotiations have gotten over the finish line. But we will bring those \u2013 we will share that information at a later date.\nJohn Massocca: Okay. And then I guess this question could go towards your overall portfolio, maybe even specifically with regards to health and fitness. Have you seen any operators do that and concerned about increased commercial restrictions that came into place as you kind of saw regional pandemic spikes in July? And I guess, do you have any kind of initial take on how that may or may not impact August rent collection?\nSumit Roy: Yes. Look, thankfully, all of this was playing out in the month of July. How people felt at the beginning of July was very different from the end of July when the contraction rates have started to go up and were very concentrated in the small states, in Texas, in Florida, in Arizona, California. And clearly, there was, if not a slowing down, there was even potentially an unwinding of the openings. But outside of California where health and fitness were asked to reclose, Florida, Texas, they continue to basically just have the restrictive \u2013 the restrictions in place in terms of the number of potential members who could be visiting the clubs, et cetera, to stay in place. And where they unwinded were on the \u2013 more on the bars and beaches and things like that. And while all of this was playing out, we were in negotiations with one of our two largest health and fitness clients and we are close to an agreement with one of them. And the other largest operator has continued to pay rent throughout the pandemic to us. So look, does that mean that they may not come back to us and talk to us if the slowdown occurs or if there is an unwinding of some of the openings? Yes, that\u2019s a possibility. But it was happening real time. And at least as of today, we have not heard back from this particular operator. So \u2013 and by the way, they ended up paying July rent. So that\u2019s part of the reason why our collections in July has been as high as it has of 91.5%.\nJohn Massocca: And just a quick point of clarification, the tenant that you\u2019re negotiating with pay the July rent, not the ones who have paid rent through the entire period of 2Q and July?\nSumit Roy: Right. So we \u2013 of the two largest operators that part of our top 20. One has paid us rent all through. And the other one ended up paying July rent.\nJohn Massocca: Okay, very helpful. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you very much.\nSumit Roy: Sure.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho.\nHaendel St. Juste: Hey there, most of mine have been asked, but I wanted to get some clarification on something you mentioned earlier. You mentioned that some tenants paid partial rents. Can you talk about some of the tenants or maybe the industry that you\u2019ve moved to partial rents beyond, say, the movies? And do you also have tenants you\u2019ve moved to percentage rents and/or have abated rent for you yet? Thanks.\nSumit Roy: Sure, Haendel. Look, I think most of the negotiations on the deferred part of the equation was around us independently verifying the liquidity situation for some of these tenants and whether or not they were open, what was their balance sheet strength and their ability to pay and that is sort of how \u2013 and in speaking with them, we have concluded as to whether there needs to be some sort of a deferment or not. And then what shape is that deferment going to take? Should we have then pay partial rent for the next few months? Should we have them pay 100% of the rent for the next few months, but make us hold on the previous three months where we may not have collected any rent? All of that has been on a case-by-case basis, Haendel. And so with the \u2013 if you think about our portfolio and you look at the industries that have been most impacted by this COVID-19 induced pandemic, it\u2019s the ones we\u2019ve been talking about. It\u2019s the theater business, it\u2019s the health and fitness business, it\u2019s daycare to some extent and the restaurant business. And they all have a different profile attached to them. If you look at the theaters, we have almost 100% of our theaters close today with the expectation that they will start opening up in August 20 for EMC and August 21 for Regal. But that, again, is subject to change if things don\u2019t improve. If you look at the day care business, most of the day care business has either been \u2013 has been partially open. Because they still continue to have restrictions in terms of the number of what percentage of occupancy they can hit. Then you look at the health and fitness business, a lot of the health and fitness business is open, either fully open or partially open. But even these occupancy numbers of \u2013 you can\u2019t have more than 30% occupancy does not impact the health and fitness business as much as it impacts some of these other businesses because they tend to run at 30% occupancy anyway. So when you take all of that into account, then you create a profile of who can pay what rent. And that leads to the types of agreements that we\u2019ve entered into, which translates to that 91.5% collection for the month of July. And so the remaining piece that hasn\u2019t been collected, what shape is that going to take? Are some of them going to start paying partial rent in the coming months? That is the expectation. But I remain cautious because it is all subject to what we see happening with the contraction rates and the mortality rates. And as long as they are stable to contain, I think we are going to be okay. But if it continues to get worse, and there is a chance that we may see some of these shutdowns reoccur and some of these discussions revisited.\nHaendel St. Juste: Certainly, certainly. Appreciate that. And I have one more. I\u2019m not sure if I missed it earlier, I\u2019ve been in and off this call with power outages here, but did you talk about your inclination to invest oversea here and Europe. You talked about Canada in the past. Last year, that was, I believe, nearly half of your investment volumes. So curious on what your appetite here is how you perceive that risk? Or perhaps could we see the bulk of your investments be more domestic? Thank you.\nSumit Roy: Yes. Haendel, the vast majority of our investments, even last year, was here in the U.S. We had about $800 million of the $3.7 billion that we did, was in the UK market. This year, the mix is 1/3, 2/3. So 2/3 of it has been here in the U.S. and 1/3 has been in the UK, and we expect that mix to play out over the remainder. But when we first entered into the UK markets, what we had shared with the market at that time was that 25% of our acquisitions we thought was going to be in the UK and 75% was going to continue to be here in the U.S. And that has shifted slightly to 1/3, 2/3. And I expect it\u2019s going to be in between those two numbers for the remainder of the year.\nHaendel St. Juste: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Anthony Paolone with J.P. Morgan.\nAnthony Paolone: Thank you. So you have 12% of your revenue that you\u2019re either negotiating or you\u2019re done with the deferral agreement. So just trying to understand if everything plays out the way these are being drafted or have been written, what is \u2013 what do collections look like come, say, 1Q or 2Q 2021? Is it 92%? Is it 98%? Just trying to understand the cadence of this returning to par, so to speak.\nSumit Roy: Look, the first metric I\u2019m focused on, Anthony, is to see, can we start collecting 100% of what\u2019s owed to us. And the good news here is that at least we are trending in that direction with every month that has gone by. And the second element of the good news that I\u2019ve seen is, not only are we trending upwards in terms of what is owed for a given month, but some of these tenants have gone back and paid us on rents that they didn\u2019t pay in the months of April, May and June. And so that continues to give us confidence that, at least they are feeling confident enough to pay us back rents that we hadn\u2019t even agreed to in terms of a deferment agreement. But I want to put all of that in context here. Look, if the COVID-19 situation continues to deteriorate, it\u2019s not out of the realm of possibility that some of these guys would come back and talk to us and say, \"Hey, sorry, we have to pause again because all of our stores have been shut down again.\" But as long as that doesn\u2019t happen or that doesn\u2019t happen in scale, then I think these trends are going to continue. And the first thing I\u2019m going to be trying to look for is when are we reaching that 100% of the old rents for a given month, when are we getting that 100% collection? And as soon as we get that, then we start to focus on, okay, all the deferred amounts and the agreements that we have put in place, are they starting to pay back portions of it? Because if you look at the vast majority of the agreements that are already in place, most of the payback is 4.5 months, 4.7 months. Sorry, 4.5 months of deferred rent and the payback is within a 12-month period. So portions of it need to start getting paid back over the next few months. And so if we start to see them paying their monthly rent plus some of the deferred rent, that\u2019s when I know we are back to normal. And the rest of it is all noise as far as I can see. I mean, look, it\u2019s important to see what is happening in each state and all of that, but ultimately, it needs to translate to our operators being able to run their businesses and feel confident enough to make the call.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay, thank you. And then second question is on 7-Eleven, I think second largest tenant. Just given what they announced earlier in the week, can you just comment on your appetite for having substantially more exposure to, say, one tenant and balancing that against perhaps being like a very good credit, which has served you well right now.\nSumit Roy: Yes. So Anthony, look, we like the convenience store business. It is the industry that we have \u2013 to be 12% of our overall portfolio is convenience stores right now. And within that, we are very grateful to have a very good relationship with 7-Eleven. And the fact that they were able to buy another tenant of ours, which is Speedway, is a good thing in my mind. They\u2019re consolidating the industry. I was going through their investor presentation yesterday, and it\u2019s got some very interesting statistics, some of which continues to reconfirm what a good operator they are and some of the synergies that they can create. Having said that, we want to be mindful of being able to run a very prudent portfolio. And \u2013 but not every tenant and not every industry is created equal. If there is an industry and there is a particular operator that we would make exceptions for, it is absolutely 7-Eleven and it is absolutely the convenience store business. But we can\u2019t let convenience store dominate 40% of our portfolio and nor can we let a single-tenant dominate a big chunk of our register on a permanent basis. But are we willing to help support some of our clients with whom we\u2019ve had an amazing relationship and we believe in the industry and we believe in a particular tenant? The answer is yes. So this is like one of our \u2013 my colleagues told us. This is the [risk on detail] for Realty Income to be able to go out and do these very large-scale transactions and be able to help our clients and at the same time, create a portfolio that continues to become incredibly strong. And so these are the opportunities that we were hoping to have discussions around them. Yes, if it presents itself and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to be all $5 billion sale-leaseback that they have identified. But if it\u2019s portions of it, we\u2019d be happy to engage in that.\nAnthony Paolone: Great. Thank you for the color.\nSumit Roy: Sure.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies.\nLinda Tsai: Thank you for taking my questions. I just had one. Understanding is a function of acquisition mix and capital costs. How do you see the 131 basis points investment spread you generated this quarter? And how does that trend in the forthcoming quarters?\nSumit Roy: Linda, you were breaking up, and I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just me, but I think your question was around the spreads that we achieved in the second quarter and how do we see it going forward? Is that right?\nLinda Tsai: Yes, that\u2019s right.\nSumit Roy: Okay. Yes. So look, the \u2013 our cost of capital in the second quarter was obviously impacted by what happened to the cost of equity during the three months, where we were in the midst of the COVID-19 situation. And the fact that our stated spread was 131 basis points. It\u2019s largely being driven by 2/3 of the equity piece, being priced reflective of where we were trading in these three months. And the question of if our cost of equity is where it is today or continues to improve from where it is today, those spreads should improve. Because the product that we are seeing is very much along the lines of what we have done in the first half. There\u2019s just a lot more of it. And so our expectation is that our spreads will improve. Our expectation is that our overall cost of capital will improve. But the fact that we have optionality to not lean on one particular source of capital versus the other, I think just gives us more optionality in terms of how do we permanently finance our transaction? And then what ultimately turns out to be the permanent spread that we are able to trap? I think that is left to be seen, but the expectation is that it should continue to improve going forward.\nLinda Tsai: Thanks.\nSumit Roy: Sure.\nOperator: And this concludes the Q&A portion of Realty\u2019s Income conference call. I would now like to turn the call over to Sumit Roy for concluding remarks.\nSumit Roy: Thank you all for joining us today, and we\u2019ll keep everyone updated on the business going forward. Thank you, Keisha, for orchestrating this call. We really appreciate it.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Sumit Roy",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrew. Welcome, everyone. I'd like to start by expressing my gratitude and appreciation towards my colleagues, whose resiliency and determination to remaining extremely productive in the face of the current pandemic continues to drive our business. We are one team, and all employees have embraced this concept through effective communication and collaboration while working remotely. Further, we empathize with the individuals and businesses impacted by COVID-19 and we continue to partner with our clients to seek mutually beneficial outcomes. Our operating results for the second quarter continue to demonstrate the stability and resiliency of our business as we generated AFFO per share of $0.86 and ended the quarter with a portfolio occupancy of 98.5%. During the quarter, we invested over $154 million in high-quality real estate, including $58 million invested internationally in the UK, which brings us to $640 million invested year-to-date. Our quarter end to date \u2013 end net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 5.1 times positions us well going forward with significant financial flexibility. While uncertainty remains due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our business, which primarily focuses on owning real estate leased to essential retail and industrial tenants continues to perform well. Rent collection since hitting a low of 84.9% in May has steadily improved. And as of July 31, we have collected 86.5% of contractual rent for the second quarter. We have collected 99.1% of contractual rent for the second quarter from investment-grade-rated tenants, which further validates the importance of a high-quality real estate portfolio leads to large, well capitalized clients. While we have not historically prioritized investment-grade-rated tenants as a primary objective, during the periods of economic uncertainty, high-grade credit tenants tend to provide more reliable streams of income as the last few months have proven out. For the month of July, we have collected 91.5% of contractual rent, which represents the second consecutive month of improved rent collection and the highest monthly rent collection since the pandemic began. Uncollected rent continues to be primarily in the theater, health and fitness and restaurant industries as these industries account for approximately 81% of uncollected rent during the second quarter. Importantly, we continue to expect to collect the vast majority of uncollected rent as we continue to consider and negotiate rent deferral agreements on a case-by-case basis. We disclosed in our financial supplement the percentage of contractual rent collected by industry. Our top four industries: convenience stores, drug stores, dollar stores and grocery stores, each sell essential goods and represents approximately 37% of rental revenue. And we have received almost all of the contractual rent due to us from tenants in these industries for the second quarter. Other industries, such as theaters, health and fitness and restaurants have been challenged due to store closures and social distancing guidelines, but we are encouraged by improved rent collection in recent months. We remain constructive on the long-term viability of these industries, particularly given our partnership with the top operators in each of these verticals. The success of the theater industry has largely been tied to the quality of films produced by Hollywood, and the U.S. box office reached an all-time high as recently as 2018. Additionally, the economic business model for studios continues to suggest, in our view, that the theater distribution channel will remain attractive going forward. We also expect the non-discretionary and low price point propositions of the quick service restaurant and health and fitness industries to support resiliency of their rent paying capabilities, particularly as their businesses begin to reopen in certain areas of the country. As we continue to manage our portfolio to support long-term value creation, we believe the breadth and depth of our asset management and real estate operations department, which is our company's largest department, is a key competitive advantage vis-a-vis our competitors. Moving on to investment activity during the first quarter. In the second quarter of 2020, we invested approximately $154 million in 32 properties located in 15 states and the United Kingdom at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of a 6.3% and with a weighted average lease term of 11.8 years. On a total revenue basis, approximately 41% of total acquisitions during the quarter were from investment-grade-rated tenants. 100% of the revenues were generated from retail tenants. These assets are leased to 14 different tenants in eight industries. We closed six discrete transactions in the second quarter and approximately 9% of second quarter investment volume for sale-leaseback transactions. Of the $154 million invested during the quarter, $96 million were invested domestically in 30 properties at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.5% and with a weighted average lease term of 12.8 years. During the quarter, $58 million was invested internationally in two properties located in the UK at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.1% and with a weighted average lease term of 9.9 years. Year-to-date, we've invested $640 million in 94 properties located in 25 states in the United Kingdom at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.1% and with a weighted average initial lease term of 13.6 years. On a revenue basis, 37% of total acquisitions are from investment-grade-rated tenants, 97% of the revenues are generated from retail and 3% are from industrial assets. These assets are leased to 29 different tenants in 17 industries. We closed 23 independent transactions year-to-date and approximately 22% of year-to-date investment volume for a sale-leaseback transaction. Of the $640 million invested year-to-date, $416 million was invested domestically in 88 properties at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.5% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.3 years. Year-to-date, approximately $224 million was invested internationally in six properties located in the UK at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.3% and with a weighted average lease term of 11.8 years. Transaction flow remains healthy as we sourced approximately $14.5 billion in the second quarter. Of the $14.5 billion sourced during the quarter, $9 billion was domestic opportunities and $5.5 billion were international opportunities. Investment-grade opportunities represented 65% of the volume sourced for the second quarter. Of the opportunities sourced during the second quarter, 55% were portfolios and 45% or approximately $6.5 billion were one-off assets. Year-to-date, we sourced approximately $32.6 billion in potential transaction opportunities. Of these opportunities, $19.3 billion were domestic opportunities and $13.3 billion were international opportunities. Investment-grade opportunities represented 49% of the volume sourced year-to-date. Of the $32.6 billion sourced year-to-date, 56% were portfolios and 44% were one-off assets. Of the $154 million in total acquisitions closed in the second quarter, 41% were one-off transactions. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital during the quarter averaged approximately 131 basis points. We define investment spreads as initial cash yield less our nominal first year weighted average cost of capital. Looking forward, our investment pipeline remains robust, and we are well positioned with strong financial flexibility. Accordingly, we are reinstating 2020 acquisition guidance with a range of $1.25 billion to $1.75 billion. Moving on to dispositions. During the quarter, we sold 12 properties for net proceeds of $7.4 million and we realized an unlevered IRR of 6.1%. This brings us to 29 properties sold year-to-date for $133.6 million at a net cash cap rate of 6.2% and we realized an unlevered IRR of 10.5%. Our portfolio is well diversified by tenant, industry, geography and property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At quarter end, our properties were leased to approximately 600 tenants in 50 different industries located in 49 states, Puerto Rico and the UK. 84% of our rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at approximately 11% of rental revenue. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 6% rental revenue. Convenience stores remains our largest industry at 12% of rental revenue. Within our overall retail portfolio, approximately 95% of our rent comes from tenants with a service non-discretionary and/or low price point component to their business. We continue to believe these characteristics allow our tenants to operate in a variety of economic environments and to compete more effectively with e-commerce. These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate, where the vast majority of recent U.S. retailer bankruptcies have been in industries that do not possess these characteristics. We continue to feel good about the credit quality in the portfolio with approximately half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment-grade-rated tenants. The weighted average rent coverage ratio for our retail properties is 2.7 times on a four-wall basis, while the median is 2.5 times. Occupancy based on the number of properties was 98.5%, consistent with the prior quarter. During the quarter, we released 65 properties, recapturing 101.4% of the expiring rent. During the first half of 2020, we released 158 properties recapturing 100.1% of expiring rents. Since our listing in 1994, we have released or sold over 3,300 properties with leases expiring, recapturing over 100% of rent on those properties that were released. Our same-store rental revenue decreased 0.4% during the quarter and 0.2% year-to-date. Our reported same-store growth includes deferred rent and unpaid rent that we have deemed to be collectible over the existing lease term. The decrease in same-store rental revenue is primarily driven by write-offs, we recognized in the restaurant industry as well as partially due to a change in methodology, as we are now recognizing percentage rent during the period it is accrued rather than during the period it is paid. Moving on, I'll provide additional detail on our financial results for the quarter, starting with income statement. Our G&A expense as a percentage of rental and other revenue for the quarter was 4.8%. Our year-to-date G&A expense ratio excluding approximately $3.5 million severance related to the departure of our former CFO, was 4.6%. We continue to have the lowest G&A ratio in the net lease REIT sector, reflecting our best in class efficiency and the scale benefits afforded to us given our size. Our non-reimbursable property expenses as a percentage of rental and other revenue was 1.4% for both the quarter and year-to-date periods. AFFO per share during the quarter was $0.86, which includes approximately $60.2 million or $0.17 per share on a fully diluted basis of deferred and unpaid rent that we deemed earned during the period and probable of being collected during the existing lease term. Briefly turning to the balance sheet, we have continued to maintain our conservative capital structure and remain only a handful of REITs with at least two A ratings. During the quarter, we issued $600 million of senior unsecured notes due 2031 within effective yield to maturity of 3.36%. And subsequent to quarter end, we add an additional $315 million at an effective yield to maturity of 2.34% blending out to just shy of 3% for the entire $950 million of notes. Additionally, we raised approximately $98.1 million of equity during the quarter, primarily through our ATM program. Year-to-date, we have raised over $1.8 billion of well-priced capital, including approximately $874 million of equity and $950 million of debt. We ended the quarter with low leverage and strong coverage metrics, but the net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 5.1 times and the fixed charge coverage ratio of 5.4 times. We continue to have very strong liquidity with approximately $400 million of cash on hand and $2.5 billion available under our revolving credit facility as of July 31, which provides us significant financial flexibility. Looking forward, overall debt maturity schedule remains in excellent shape, as a weighted average maturity of a bond is 8.3 years. Additionally, we have nest in $140 million of debt coming due through 2021. In summary, our balance sheet is in great shape and we continue to have low leverage, strong coverage metrics and ample liquidity. In June, we increase the dividend for the 107 time in our company's history. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of approximately 4.5%. And we are proud to be one of only three REITs in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, but having increase the dividend every year for the last 25 consecutive years. Moving on, we have always managed the business with a focus on economic resiliency and generating stable and increasing cash flow through a variety of economic environments. And we continue to do so through the current climate of uncertainty driven by COVID-19. We deliberately designed a high quality real estate portfolio leased primarily to tenants providing non-discretionary or low price point goods or services, as well as with the focus on partnering with large well-capitalized operators who are leaders in their respective industries. Our judicious balance sheet management and the strength of our financial position are evidenced by 2A credit ratings and our current financial flexibility and liquidity positions us favorably to capitalize and growing opportunities going forward. And we have reinstated 2020 acquisitions guidance with a range of $1.25 billion to $1.75 billion. At this time, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator? Yes, it's a very good question, Shivani. The way to answer it is, for the high quality essential retail product, the competition for that product remains fierce. And in fact, it's translating into cap rates that I would say has tightened vis-a\u0300-vis pre-COVID levels. And so in terms of number of potential buyers, looking at that product continues to be very strong. I would say that we don't see as many public net lease companies in the space today. And this is an overall comment as we did pre-COVID. But given what we've heard in the recent second quarter earnings announcement, I expect that that's going to change. But at least over the second quarter and in transactions that we pursued more recently, the number of public buyers tend to be less. On the international side, however, the number of buyers and most of the time we're competing with private institutes has continued to be very strong. And in fact, there have been occasions where we walked away from transactions that were right down the fairway for us, but because of pricing getting very, very competitive. So in general, I would say that all the products that we are pursuing the competition remains strong and I expect that most of the public net lease buyers are going to stop playing in that space sooner now. Sure. Look, I think the UK market and I'd say the overall European market has continued to be a very strong source of growth for us. There were about $650 million worth of sale lease back opportunities that basically take all of the criteria that you'd be looking for outside of pricing. And given our disciplined approach to acquisitions, we chose to not continue to pursue those transactions. And if you look at the sourcing numbers, of the $34 billion, $13 billion was \u2013 has been sourced internationally. And that is well above what we had originally anticipated when we went into the UK market. And so the product remains strong in the international markets. I would say that even here in the U.S., our sourcing numbers is a testament to it. There remains plenty of products, both on the sale lease back side of the equation, as well as on the one off market. And the reason why we felt very comfortable reinstating our acquisition guidance is a testament to the pipeline that we currently have. The discussions that we currently have with our relationship tenants and what we are seeing on the sourcing side of the equation. Thank you. There's a bit of static, but we can hear you. Look, our business philosophy has been that the products that we like we would like to hold it forever, and I'm being a bit facetious there. But the idea being that, trying to time the market and sell when we believe that the cap rates are low and et cetera. Doesn't always play out and our history has proven that if we hold onto assets and continue to work with our partners or whom these assets are deemed critical, we will create value and we will create value with less volatility and of equivalent nominal terms. And that has sort of proven out to be the case, but that's not to say that opportunistically, we won't take advantage of the market like we did in the first quarter, where on the consumer electronic side of the business, we decided to sell the assets back to our tenants with whom we were having discussions of looking at other opportunities. But also looking to, to potentially help them address some of their own objectives, and we were able to generate 11% unlevered IRR based on selling those assets back. But our philosophy is, let's buy the assets that work for our tenants. Let's get into very long-term leases with minimal to zero capital invested in those assets. And we will create value, especially, if it continues to work for our tenants. And that continues to be our philosophy. Yes. I would say the vast majority is retail. It's not to say that we are not seeing industrial. Those are the only two products that we are really looking at right now, Nate. But I would say, anywhere between 60% to 70% of what we are sourcing is on the retail side of the ledger. And 30% to 40% is going to be on the industrial side. Look, it's no secret. We want to grow the industrial portion of our asset type. It's something that we are very much focused on. We have made a concerted effort to cultivate relationships with folks, who could potentially provide us with this product. And it is starting to take shape and we are being able to generate some transaction flow from that side of the business, but what's keeps us a little bit on the sidelines, continues to be the fact that our cost of capital is not quite where it was four months ago. And if that were no longer a constraint in terms of the product itself and what's available. There is plenty of very good product in the industries that we want to participate in with operators that we would love to grow our relationship with. And so yes, it's about 60% to 70%, 30% to 40% is the split. Yes, that's a good question, Christy. We believe that we can get to the midpoint of our guidance without having to necessarily rely upon the equity market \u2013 the capital markets. And still stay within what we would deem as conservative what our rating agencies would deem as being in line with the ratings that we have. Having said that, our hope is that with continued positive results on the operating side of the business and continuing to post information that will allow our cost of equity to improve that opportunistically, we will be happy to continue to raise equity capital. But the point I want to leave you with is, we don't have to do that. Part of the reason why we entered 2011 and we did the very large equity raise was to get in a situation, where we had created enough of a capacity and had under leveraged our balance sheet coming out in March, where if we needed to lean on the debt capital markets, which seem to have corrected a lot sooner than the equity markets have, we could lean on that side of the equation and still stay within levels that, that our rating agencies would continue to support the 2 A ratings. So that's where we are. Yes. Look, let's talk about AMC. We've just agreed to terms of AMC. They started paying partial rent in the month of July, which was a very good signal to us. We've entered into a payback on the deferred rent that we've entered into. And the payback is going to be longer. It's going to have \u2013 the average payback is going to be 2.7 years. But the fact that we were able to enter into an agreement with AMC, the fact that they were able to start paying us rent for the month of July. These are good signs. Look, we're seeing the same thing that you're seeing. The advantage that we have is we can pick up the phone and we can have a conversation with the AMC. And what they've shared with us with regards to the agreement that they've entered into with Universal is the basic premise for them doing this. Was that they believe that within the first 17 days, they get 75% to 90% of the box office revenues. And for the blockbusters, they generate 90% of the receipts within the first three weeks. So they didn't believe that there would be significant cannibalization since the movie will be advertised as PVOD only after the first two weeks of the theatrical release. And the fact that they also get a share of the PVOD revenues is another source of revenue stream that gave them comfort. But the basic premise was that the economic pie in entering into this sort of an agreement is actually going to increase for both parties. And so listen, time will tell, we've run our own scenarios based on the information that AMC has shared. And at the corporate level, we believe that, they'll be either at 0% to negative 5% of the profitability creating this arrangement. And so we'll see. But they at least feel confident enough to have entered into an agreement with us. They started paying showing \u2013 they've started paying rent for the month of July partial rent. But all of that continues to help support the thesis that we have that the AMC should come out, okay. Based on our own independent analysis, Christy, we think that they will be fine through November, even in the scenario where they have zero openings. And then obviously if we \u2013 if this slowdown continues and more and more theaters are shut down or they're unable to open that theaters as they've shared with us, which is August 20th, they would like to start opening up some of their theaters. Then of course, there's a chance that they'll might come back and ask for more different grants. But that's the way we are currently. And this is an analysis that we are doing on a month to month basis, which is primarily the reason why we took the $8.5 million of write-off for the second quarter. So we continue to believe that this is from an industry perspective, the theater business is a sound business, but certainly going forward, if you look at our overall portfolio, we are revisiting in terms of what percentage of our overall portfolio should theaters constitute. Yes. And Michael, that might turn out to be exactly the case. And from a theater perspective, I think you're right. The actual box will potentially be generating less profitability for EMC, the corporate. But here's the other piece that I want us to contemplate. And listen, these are all pieces that we are putting out and we are trying to run numbers, et cetera. But if you look at the math associated with something that is shown in the theater versus PVOD, even for the studios, the math is not going to pencil if it is PVOD only. The vast majority of their profitability comes from getting that 55% to 60% of revenues that are generated at the theaters. And it is much more for these big blockbuster movies, which tends to be where Hollywood is migrating towards. And I think this arrangement is more for movies that potentially are not quite as popular, its lower budget, how do we continue to maximize the revenue and perhaps PVOD is a better way to maximize that piece of movies that are being generated by studios. And so really, based on the conversations, we've had, the idea here is that this is going to allow the studios to become more profitable, but it should also at the very least make theaters at the corporate level. Either home or potentially participate in some upside. And at least, the studios become healthier. They'll be able to generate better movies and be able to generate big tent movies, and that should translate to better content for the theater industry. But this is a thesis. So I get your concern, Michael. We are following this very closely and we'll see how all of this plays out. Yes. So even where we are today, Nick, I think we feel you're not super excited about our cost of equity, but our overall cost of capital still will allow us to continue to chase transactions that we otherwise believe checks all of the boxes. In terms of the industries, we want to focus on the operators within those industries, we want to be in and the real estate asset type. And that hasn't changed. What gave us confidence in being able to put out the acquisition numbers was really our pipeline. And the number of inbounds that we started to get over the last two and a half, three months. And the fact that, the volatility that was that we saw earlier on in the quarter, where our stock could move 8%, 9% on a day that seems to have gotten a bit more benign. It gave us the confidence to be able to go out and say, based on the pipeline we've created, based on the discussions we having, that we'll be able to hit that $1.25 billion to $1.75 billion acquisition number. And our ability to do $200 million portfolio deals has not changed and the fact that we are today under leveraged. I think allows us to not have to rely on the most volatile of biggest component of our capital stack, which is equity. We can just lean on the debt side of the equation, it seems to have normalized considerably since the earlier month. And be able to finance our acquisition. So having that optionality is obviously what gave us a confidence to be able to go out with a number that we feel likely to need. Absolutely. Sorry. I didn't answer that directly. That's correct. I wouldn't use the word measurable, but yes on the margin, do I expect you to have an impact, absolutely. We don't necessarily compete with 1031 buyers too much maybe on the quick service restaurant side of the business. We will run into some of these buyers on a one off transaction, but by and large, we are buying portfolios, even smaller portfolio transactions. And we have all of the usual suspects that are not 1031, who play in that market. Then switching over to the disposition market. Most of our dispositions tend to be vacant assets and you don't see 1031 buyers playing in that particular market. It tends to be developers or tenants who want to own their own space, who tend to play in that particular market. So the only area where we might see them is sending occupied assets on a one off basis. And that doesn't end to be a big part of our overall portfolio. Sure. Yes, actually \u2013 so I'll answer your first question. Second part of your question first, Spenser, that's, okay. We've been sharing our monthly collection information pretty much on a monthly basis. And if you recall, when we first came out with April rents we had said it was 82.9% today. It's tracking at 88.4% for me rented with a similar trend. We originally came up with 82%. Today, it's at 84.9%. But similarly with June, we were at 85.7% and today it's at 86.1%. So in each one of these months, what happened was we've had some of our tenants who went back and made us home. Some of them were on from the, on the restaurant side of the equation. Some of them were health and fitness businesses, and some were data centers that basically decided to make us hold for the month of April, may and June. So that's certainly happened where initially we thought we may have to pursue deferment agreements with some of these tenants. And they came back because the business has opened earlier than they expected and/or they felt better about the liquidity situation and decided to make us home. With respect to the first part of your question, Spenser around, did we have to alter the leases, the vast majority of what we have entered into, which is that $14 million worth of rent of the total $16 million that we entered into an agreement has been done without having to make amendments to the lease itself to the original lease term. And so that is the main reason why, we are being able to stay within the accounting rules to view these as different rents. So we haven't had to sort of request a longer duration or a payback, et cetera. We expect to be paid back during the original lease term, and therefore we didn't have to enter into any of lease modification. And that is a similar story on the remaining $46 million that we have entered into discussions with. Now around the edges, there have been some tenants where they requested a longer payback period, which went beyond the original lease term. And those have obviously been \u2013 they are not part of the deferred rent agreements, which didn't result in a lease amendment. And so \u2013 but that's a very, very small percentage. The vast majority has been with \u2013 without having to make amendments to the lease itself. Yes. Todd. Actually, there were a couple of transactions there in the $650 million that I talked about. Both were international and they were both products that we would have absolutely love to have owned. I don't want to speak to the specific cap rates because these are fairly large transactions. And if you do some amount of research, you'll be able to figure them out. And one's not public yet. So \u2013 but what I will say is if you look at, I'll answer your question slightly differently, Todd, if you look at the spreads we are making, we made about $135 million \u2013 135 basis points of spreads, which was 15 basis points inside of our average spread that we've made in the history of our acquisitions. And so the point I want to make is, yes, we are willing to make smaller spread, but not to a point, which does not justify day one having enough of a positive uplift from these investments and take into account some of the risks that are inherent in these investments, though, if you look at the industry, you look at the operator, these are the types of businesses and operators that you feel a very high level of confidence that not only will they make it through the initial lease term, but will continue to operate these businesses post their initial lease term, and these lease terms tend to be 15 years to 20 years. So \u2013 but we have \u2013 we've done up to 131 of basis point spread. So we are certainly willing to go south of what our average spread has been, but there is a point beyond which we won't go. Sure. So there are a couple of operators that constituted the biggest chunk of that write-off. One's NPC that filed BK. And another one is continuing to pay rent, but it's just one that we feel we don't have the same level of confidence. And this is a name that has been on our watch list for over a year now. And in fact, they did end up paying July rent. But nevertheless, we feel like our level of confidence doesn't quite meet that 75% collectibility threshold, and so we decided to write those off. And so that's \u2013 those are the two names that constitute the QSR piece of the write-off. Sure. Yes. We did not share with you, John, what the results are for July in terms of our negotiation. What I have shared with you is of the 86.5% that we collected for the second quarter, i.e. the 13.5% that remained uncollected, 9% of that is basically that $46.2 million that we've shared with you in terms of rent that we are in the midst of negotiating. There isn't an agreement in place. $14.1 million or approximately 3% are our negotiations that have completed or are very close to being penciled. And then the remaining 1.3% of that 13.5% uncollected was written off. So that's the \u2013 those are the three buckets of that 13.5% that we didn't collect for the second quarter. We haven't shared for the month of July, the 8.5% of uncollected, what's the breakup there. But those numbers, obviously, the \u2013 what was being negotiated, that number has reduced because some of those negotiations have gotten over the finish line. But we will bring those \u2013 we will share that information at a later date. Yes. Look, thankfully, all of this was playing out in the month of July. How people felt at the beginning of July was very different from the end of July when the contraction rates have started to go up and were very concentrated in the small states, in Texas, in Florida, in Arizona, California. And clearly, there was, if not a slowing down, there was even potentially an unwinding of the openings. But outside of California where health and fitness were asked to reclose, Florida, Texas, they continue to basically just have the restrictive \u2013 the restrictions in place in terms of the number of potential members who could be visiting the clubs, et cetera, to stay in place. And where they unwinded were on the \u2013 more on the bars and beaches and things like that. And while all of this was playing out, we were in negotiations with one of our two largest health and fitness clients and we are close to an agreement with one of them. And the other largest operator has continued to pay rent throughout the pandemic to us. So look, does that mean that they may not come back to us and talk to us if the slowdown occurs or if there is an unwinding of some of the openings? Yes, that's a possibility. But it was happening real time. And at least as of today, we have not heard back from this particular operator. So \u2013 and by the way, they ended up paying July rent. So that's part of the reason why our collections in July has been as high as it has of 91.5%. Right. So we \u2013 of the two largest operators that part of our top 20. One has paid us rent all through. And the other one ended up paying July rent. Sure. Sure, Haendel. Look, I think most of the negotiations on the deferred part of the equation was around us independently verifying the liquidity situation for some of these tenants and whether or not they were open, what was their balance sheet strength and their ability to pay and that is sort of how \u2013 and in speaking with them, we have concluded as to whether there needs to be some sort of a deferment or not. And then what shape is that deferment going to take? Should we have then pay partial rent for the next few months? Should we have them pay 100% of the rent for the next few months, but make us hold on the previous three months where we may not have collected any rent? All of that has been on a case-by-case basis, Haendel. And so with the \u2013 if you think about our portfolio and you look at the industries that have been most impacted by this COVID-19 induced pandemic, it's the ones we've been talking about. It's the theater business, it's the health and fitness business, it's daycare to some extent and the restaurant business. And they all have a different profile attached to them. If you look at the theaters, we have almost 100% of our theaters close today with the expectation that they will start opening up in August 20 for EMC and August 21 for Regal. But that, again, is subject to change if things don't improve. If you look at the day care business, most of the day care business has either been \u2013 has been partially open. Because they still continue to have restrictions in terms of the number of what percentage of occupancy they can hit. Then you look at the health and fitness business, a lot of the health and fitness business is open, either fully open or partially open. But even these occupancy numbers of \u2013 you can't have more than 30% occupancy does not impact the health and fitness business as much as it impacts some of these other businesses because they tend to run at 30% occupancy anyway. So when you take all of that into account, then you create a profile of who can pay what rent. And that leads to the types of agreements that we've entered into, which translates to that 91.5% collection for the month of July. And so the remaining piece that hasn't been collected, what shape is that going to take? Are some of them going to start paying partial rent in the coming months? That is the expectation. But I remain cautious because it is all subject to what we see happening with the contraction rates and the mortality rates. And as long as they are stable to contain, I think we are going to be okay. But if it continues to get worse, and there is a chance that we may see some of these shutdowns reoccur and some of these discussions revisited. Yes. Haendel, the vast majority of our investments, even last year, was here in the U.S. We had about $800 million of the $3.7 billion that we did, was in the UK market. This year, the mix is 1/3, 2/3. So 2/3 of it has been here in the U.S. and 1/3 has been in the UK, and we expect that mix to play out over the remainder. But when we first entered into the UK markets, what we had shared with the market at that time was that 25% of our acquisitions we thought was going to be in the UK and 75% was going to continue to be here in the U.S. And that has shifted slightly to 1/3, 2/3. And I expect it's going to be in between those two numbers for the remainder of the year. Look, the first metric I'm focused on, Anthony, is to see, can we start collecting 100% of what's owed to us. And the good news here is that at least we are trending in that direction with every month that has gone by. And the second element of the good news that I've seen is, not only are we trending upwards in terms of what is owed for a given month, but some of these tenants have gone back and paid us on rents that they didn't pay in the months of April, May and June. And so that continues to give us confidence that, at least they are feeling confident enough to pay us back rents that we hadn't even agreed to in terms of a deferment agreement. But I want to put all of that in context here. Look, if the COVID-19 situation continues to deteriorate, it's not out of the realm of possibility that some of these guys would come back and talk to us and say, \"Hey, sorry, we have to pause again because all of our stores have been shut down again.\" But as long as that doesn't happen or that doesn't happen in scale, then I think these trends are going to continue. And the first thing I'm going to be trying to look for is when are we reaching that 100% of the old rents for a given month, when are we getting that 100% collection? And as soon as we get that, then we start to focus on, okay, all the deferred amounts and the agreements that we have put in place, are they starting to pay back portions of it? Because if you look at the vast majority of the agreements that are already in place, most of the payback is 4.5 months, 4.7 months. Sorry, 4.5 months of deferred rent and the payback is within a 12-month period. So portions of it need to start getting paid back over the next few months. And so if we start to see them paying their monthly rent plus some of the deferred rent, that's when I know we are back to normal. And the rest of it is all noise as far as I can see. I mean, look, it's important to see what is happening in each state and all of that, but ultimately, it needs to translate to our operators being able to run their businesses and feel confident enough to make the call. Yes. So Anthony, look, we like the convenience store business. It is the industry that we have \u2013 to be 12% of our overall portfolio is convenience stores right now. And within that, we are very grateful to have a very good relationship with 7-Eleven. And the fact that they were able to buy another tenant of ours, which is Speedway, is a good thing in my mind. They're consolidating the industry. I was going through their investor presentation yesterday, and it's got some very interesting statistics, some of which continues to reconfirm what a good operator they are and some of the synergies that they can create. Having said that, we want to be mindful of being able to run a very prudent portfolio. And \u2013 but not every tenant and not every industry is created equal. If there is an industry and there is a particular operator that we would make exceptions for, it is absolutely 7-Eleven and it is absolutely the convenience store business. But we can't let convenience store dominate 40% of our portfolio and nor can we let a single-tenant dominate a big chunk of our register on a permanent basis. But are we willing to help support some of our clients with whom we've had an amazing relationship and we believe in the industry and we believe in a particular tenant? The answer is yes. So this is like one of our \u2013 my colleagues told us. This is the [risk on detail] for Realty Income to be able to go out and do these very large-scale transactions and be able to help our clients and at the same time, create a portfolio that continues to become incredibly strong. And so these are the opportunities that we were hoping to have discussions around them. Yes, if it presents itself and I don't know if it's going to be all $5 billion sale-leaseback that they have identified. But if it's portions of it, we'd be happy to engage in that. Sure. Linda, you were breaking up, and I don't know if it's just me, but I think your question was around the spreads that we achieved in the second quarter and how do we see it going forward? Is that right? Okay. Yes. So look, the \u2013 our cost of capital in the second quarter was obviously impacted by what happened to the cost of equity during the three months, where we were in the midst of the COVID-19 situation. And the fact that our stated spread was 131 basis points. It's largely being driven by 2/3 of the equity piece, being priced reflective of where we were trading in these three months. And the question of if our cost of equity is where it is today or continues to improve from where it is today, those spreads should improve. Because the product that we are seeing is very much along the lines of what we have done in the first half. There's just a lot more of it. And so our expectation is that our spreads will improve. Our expectation is that our overall cost of capital will improve. But the fact that we have optionality to not lean on one particular source of capital versus the other, I think just gives us more optionality in terms of how do we permanently finance our transaction? And then what ultimately turns out to be the permanent spread that we are able to trap? I think that is left to be seen, but the expectation is that it should continue to improve going forward. Sure. Thank you all for joining us today, and we'll keep everyone updated on the business going forward. Thank you, Keisha, for orchestrating this call. We really appreciate it."

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to Bonni Rosen, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nBonni Rosen: Thank you for joining us today for the VEREIT 2020 First Quarter Earnings Call. Joining me today are Glenn Rufrano, our Chief Executive Officer; Paul McDowell, our Chief Operating Officer; Mike Bartolotta, our Chief Financial Officer and Tom Roberts, our Chief Investment Officer. Today's call is being webcast on our website at vereit.com in the Investor Relations section. There will be a replay of the call beginning at approximately 2:30 p.m. Eastern Time today. Dial-in for the replay is 1-877-344-7529 with the confirmation code of 10143075. Before I turn the call over to Glenn, I would like to remind everyone that certain statements in this earnings call, which are not historical facts, will be forward looking. VERIET's actual results may differ materially from these forward-looking statement and factors that could cause these differences are detailed in our SEC filings, including the quarterly report filed today. In addition, as stated more fully in our SEC reports, VERIET disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statement except as expressly required by law. Let me quickly review the format of today's call. First, Glenn will begin by providing a brief business summary, followed by Paul who will give an operational update with Mike then presenting our financial and balance sheet. Glenn will then wrap up with closing remarks. We will conclude today's call by opening the line for questions, where we will be joined by our Chief Investment Officer, Tom Roberts. Glenn, let me turn the call over to you.\nGlenn Rufrano: Thanks Bonni. And thanks for joining us today. The world has changed and while we know that normal first quarter results will not be at the forefront of this call, there are a few quick highlights. AFFO per diluted share for the quarter was $0.17. Year-to-date acquisitions totaled $146 million. In addition, the office partnership acquired a $33 million property of which the company cash contribution was $2.7 million. Dispositions totaled $188 million including the Company\u2019s share of dispositions contributed to the office partnership of $70.2 million. As the impact of Covid-19 grew in March, we paused balance sheet acquisitions to better understand the current environment. Net debt to normalize EBITDA was unchanged from last quarter at 5.7x. What have we been thinking about since the quarter end? We are certainly happy that our team together since 2015 executed a number of strategies and transactions as a prerequisite to begin growth in 2020. We believed it was prudent to sell the nontraded REIT business, Cole Capital, greatly reduced the concentration in our largest tenant and generally diversify the portfolio. Settle all outstanding litigation and obtain an investment grade rating balance sheet. Our business model diversifies our capital sources to include institutional partnerships, picking assets which pose no conflict. However, here we are in a disrupted economy. And we now have four overriding goals. Keep our employees safe and provide a work environment and tools to be productive. Recognize the extent of challenges and interact in a collaborative fashion. Maintain the progress we work so hard for especially the resulting investment grade balance sheets and use the business model we built to grow AFFO when the market stabilizes. We understand there are a number of portfolio factors you are interested in and I will let our Chief Operating Officer, Paul McDowell, who has been working closely with our tenants, bring you up to date. Paul?\nPaul McDowell: Thanks Glenn. As already mentioned, we know the focal point for this call is how the portfolio is performing during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, our teams are still very focused on normal asset management which is also very important. Leasing for the quarter was very strong with over 2 million square feet leased of which 1.4 million square feet were early renewals. Total activity included 1.3 million square feet of industrial, 498,000 square feet of office; a 190,000 square feet of retail and 73,000 square feet of restaurants. For renewal leases, we recaptured approximately 94% of prior rents on an initial cash basis. And many of these newly extended leases have additional built in rent increases. Importantly, we were able to finalize leases we had in process prior to the pandemic disruption along with some dispositions and some of that activity has carried further into Q2. Occupancy ended the quarter at a healthy 99.1%. Now let's talk more specifically about our portfolio performance and where we are today. Our April rent receipt came in at 81% and so far rent for May is at 78% which includes 2% to be paid from a government agency tenant that pays in arrears. The underpinnings of these relatively strong collection results were driven by our property type diversification, industry breakdown, investment grade tenancy; public versus private ownership and geographic diversity. Our allocation to office, industrial and necessity based retail including our top industry exposures such as discount, pharmacy, grocery warehouse clubs and convenience has helped in our rental collection. Overall, 17 of our Top 20 tenants effectively paid full rent in April. In May so far 16 of our Top 20 tenants have paid rent.  Or approximately 37% of investment-grade tenancy for the total portfolio and 46% within retail were a strong component of April rent collections at almost a 100%. And well over 95% so far in May. Over 60% of our tenants are public in the overall portfolio and over 68% are public within the retail portfolio which we view very positively. Fortunately, we have a lot of geographic diversity with many of our properties spread out in areas of the country that have had less impact from the virus and many are in states that have started to reopen for business. Although, they remain a patchwork of restrictions based on regions of the country open now or opening soon in some capacity, we have 3,393 properties or 88% in these open locations. Only about 9.6% of our portfolio is in the hard-hit northeast with 2.3% and 3.1% in the hardest-hit states of New York and New Jersey respectively. The largest real estate teams in our company have always been our strong and our very experienced asset management and property management departments, which have served us well. These teams have been augmented in the past two months with personnel from underwriting and acquisitions. Collectively, they have been doing an outstanding job in trying circumstances and our collections to date are partially reflective of those efforts. And I will take this opportunity to thank them. Our dedicated property type asset management teams have been in discussion with our tenants to understand the impact of Covid-19 on their businesses. Rent relief requests have been received from tenants representing approximately 34% of rental income on an annualized basis. We have been evaluating each request on a case-by-case basis based on each tenant's unique financial and operating situation, analyzing metrics such as industry segments, geographic locations where they are operating; corporate financial health, rent coverage and the tenants' liquidity. Our goal has been to help those tenants we think need and deserve it in the short run, while at the same time pressing for payment from those tenants who we judge do not merit rent relief, have access to other forms of capital or being opportunistic. Of the received requests to date, a little over a third have been approved, about a third are in negotiations and about a third have either been denied or we have taken no action. The deferral agreements we have made generally have been in a two to four month range and pay back within 12-months with interest as appropriate. While we have generally structured any rent relief as deferral not abatement, in a small number of cases we have created rent per term for tenants we think will be here in the long term and where we think we've created value in a longer lease. It is worth noting again that the vast majority of our ARI comes from large public and private companies that have the financial resources and access to capital necessary to weather this storm. We do, however, have some smaller tenants and so we've also been monitoring the various government assistance programs, which we think can be helpful to some of our most impacted industries such as franchise restaurants and entertainment related retail. About half of the tenants with in the restaurant portfolio have applied to the Paycheck Protection Program and we expect some amount will have access to these funds. We also have been monitoring the new governmental initiatives such as the Main Street Lending Program which may help some of our larger tenants. Finally, as I noted above rent collections so far for May are 78% which is about 1% ahead of where we were during the same time period in April. As others have pointed out, many tenants went into April with some momentum from the first quarter with May be in the month where the full impact of the shutdown has been felt. With that in mind, we are very gratified with our collection levels so far for May. Our current expectation is that total collections for May will be approximately where April ended. Industrial is so far coming in a bit lower than April primarily to one tenant which paid in April and we believe can continue to pay. We are currently in discussions with that tenant. At this point, we think June collections will be in the range of collections for April and May. Further portfolio segment information and details can be found in our Investor presentation file today. I will now turn the call over to Mike. Mike?\nMike Bartolotta: Thanks Paul and thank you all for joining us today. Our first quarter numbers really were on target. However, we recognize that going forward for some time it's a different environment and what's most important is our balance sheet and liquidity. Before I get into that though let me quickly discuss how we prepared as a company to ensure the smoothest transition to our virtual environment. We're currently operating essentially 100% remotely. Anticipating that an office shutdown was probable, our IT team quickly mobilized our business continuity plans and made sure we had equipment for all employees who are able to work effectively from home. Employees are utilizing virtual private networks in their homes to maintain a high level of security and we prepared training and awareness materials for employees to help them get set up and they continue to have access to a 24x7 IT support desk. In addition, the management committee participates in daily virtual meetings to make sure the business is operating efficiently. I've been impressed with how well everyone has been able to adapt during this difficult period and I'd like to thank our entire team for all of their efforts in keeping the business running as normal as possible. Turning to our balance sheet now. The company remains well positions with net debt to normalize EBITDA unchanged from year-end at 5.7x. A key focal point for us as a company has been maintaining a strong and liquid balance sheet and we worked very hard over the last few years to gain back our investment grade rating. As Covid-19 pandemic continued to unfold, we initiated an additional draw in excess of normal operating requirements of $600 million on our revolving line of credit to enhance our cash position. As of May 15, VEREIT had corporate liquidity of approximately $1.2 billion comprised of $601 million in cash and cash equivalents and $588 million of availability under our credit facility. Our fixed charge coverage ratio remained healthy increasing to 3.3x and our net debt to gross real estate investment ratio was 39%. Our unencumbered asset ratio increased to 81%; the weighted average duration of our debt was 4.4 years and we are 86% fixed, which reflects the higher utilization of our line of credit this quarter. Additionally, we a very manageable amount of debt coming due in the near term. As of quarter end, we had $90 million in mortgage notes payable due this year at a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5%. And we had a $322 million convertible bond due at the end of December. In 2021, we have $299 million in mortgage notes payable due throughout next year but no other corporate bonds coming due until 2024j. Based on what I see now, we see no issues with our covenants. Moving to our outlook. We withdrew guidance in April and are not providing an update at this time due to the uncertain market we all face; the Board of Directors is reducing the second quarter dividend from $0.1375 to $0.077 representing a decrease of 44%. The reduction was determined after extensive financial analysis. This allows us to prudently manage our debt levels and the balance sheet stability we work so hard for over the last five years. Board of Directors has not made any decisions with respect to its dividend policy beyond the second quarter and we'll continue to monitor the current environment and its impact on our tenants and business. Based on our estimate of taxable net income today, we see no issues with this reduction and satisfy our REIT requirements. And with that I will turn the call back to Glenn.\nGlenn Rufrano: Thanks Mike. Our defined corporate commitment is to always serve to the best of our ability, three main constituencies. Our stakeholders, tenants and employees. Our combined efforts continue to focus on all three. We transitioned our employees to a fully virtual work from home environment in the middle of March quickly new processes and business intelligence tracking tools were developed to assist and monitoring our tenants and potential risks that can come our way. We have a deeply experienced team here at the company not only on the executive management side, but within all of our real estate groups. As leasing and asset management becomes even more important during this time, we have transitioned some of our acquisition personnel as well as others to assist with navigating the challenges our tenants will be facing. Our legal staff, attorneys and paralegals are working to support our efforts. I also said on daily calls where we strive to come up with the best tenant solutions. Every request goes through a process and ends with a sign-off from our investment committee consisting of myself, Paul, Tom and Mike. Our dedicated employee teams have collectively exhibited great energy and resolve and we thank them. Mike presented our current balance sheet statistics. Of note we maintain net debt to EBITDA 5.7x. Our cash and revolving liquidity remains sufficient and our assets are highly liquid with 81% unencumbered. But the exception of our converts later this year. We have no corporate bonds due until 2024. The Board's decision to reduce the dividend for this quarter is not based generally upon a micro review of our business, but more importantly on a macro view when uncertain economy. The difficulty in predicting the duration of this economic disturbance is glaring. Possibilities are extraordinarily wide. When you know where you are, you can better judge what to do and how to do it. While we are getting a better view of tenant receipts with April and May, duration can have a variety of outcomes.  Our view is that with such uncertainties strong balance sheet maintains stakeholder value. The sizing of the dividend was based upon a series of financial analyses, dissecting a range of possible outcomes throughout this year and next. We chose this base amount on which to build the dividend while protecting against any increase in debt. As more information is available in each of the next two quarters, this decision will be under constant review. As you heard in Paul's presentation, our portfolio diversification is serving us well not only by property type, but also investment grade parentage, credit, industry and geographic limits, as well as a high percentage of public companies. We will of course reevaluate the portfolio parameters as we move throughout this year. While we are in a very difficult environment, our business model provides the ability to grow and thrive once we get past this. Although disappointed that 2020 will be a transition year, our experience in transforming the company over the last five years will provide strength to get us through this. Our expectations for the future is that our liquid balance sheet, diversified portfolio, experienced team and partnerships will all perform and reignite hopefully in 2021. Before ending, I would like to applaud those in the healthcare profession and all first responders who have made such a difference in our lives, certainly mine. I also want to take this time to thank everyone for their kind notes during my recovery from the virus. They were great pick me ups, and very much appreciate it. I'll now open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Haendel Juste from Mizuho. Go ahead.\nHaendelJuste: Hey, good afternoon. And Glenn, good to hear your voice again. Glad that budget back and well again. So first question is more high level to think about the portfolio and curious on how Covid and life in the aftermath of Covid might be impacting your view on your portfolio allocation and subcategory exposures going forward. Clearly having a bit more office and industrial has been beneficial. So I'm curious how the thinking yours, the board might be evolving here on portfolio balance effect or allocation post Covid? Thank you.\nGlennRufrano: Sure. Thank Haendel. And thanks for your kind note. As you know, we -- as you followed us, Haendel, and others we've been pretty disciplined since 2018. The portfolio at that time we generally not understood and so we try to make sure the market understood what we were thinking in the future. We put metrics around a number of elements here, percentages of property type, tenant credit, investment grade rating, geography and a number of others, all to provide diversification. So we have always thought that understanding the portfolio long term is the right thing to do. And we will continue due to that in future. So that's before. Now let's if I took us to just January first and we thought about where our portfolio should be, we'd be saying certain things like experiential real estates a good idea because it's a bridge against e-commerce and restaurants and entertainment is pretty good. We also had a number of conversations on these calls about pharmacies. Well, would pharmacies be best or not be best in the portfolio, that's turned around today. We have all turned around today based upon this pandemic in terms of what property types may or may not perform over periods of time. The one thing that I say for us now thinking about the portfolio is that we're not going to make decisions based upon what's happened today. We're in the middle of the storm. We're going to wait for some of this storm to subside before we make decisions on where the metrics will be and how we will reshape the portfolio. I believe there will be some reshaping but how we will shape is very hard for us to judge right now. To your point some property types like office are now performing well. Our industrial performance is very good and the only thing -- the only constant denominator that I can take out of what's happened over the last five to six years is that diversification is a plus, will always be diversified but we may change some of our metrics in the future. We're just not ready to do that yet, Haendel.\nHaendelJuste: Got it. And thank you for the perspective, appreciated. And then a bit more on the dividend, appreciate your comments earlier but I was hoping if you could give us a bit more perspective on the process to cut the second quarter specifically at 44%. Some reason other sectors have opted to cut the dividend or suspend until the end of the year and make a final determination; others have credit immediately, so I'm curious on why 44% to second quarter versus these other options and perhaps are we trying to read too much into it to suggest or to think that this suggests an estimated recovery of maybe 90-ish percent of your cash flows, prior cash flow pre Covid. So any other context around your thinking here and what maybe we should be reading into it. Thank you.\nGlennRufrano: No, good, another good question. Certainly that was a difference this quarter. The first, I'd say it's not easy -- it's not an easy decision to reduce a dividend, it's just not. Make your feet burn and your stomachs turn when you have to make a decision like that but we as a company and the board thought it was necessary to make that decision. The decision itself as I mentioned wasn't only based upon the macro review what's happening today, it's more importantly it was really based upon the uncertainty of what's happening in the economy. It's a very difficult to predict duration here and we have -- will all have a hard time on duration and that will play a very important role in what and how our tenants will run their businesses. But what we decided was that we would take a look at various outcomes of what can happen over the next year or two. We have a basis in April and May which is helpful that it was better than the sort of April. I'm not sure we knew what was going to happen. We have a better feel for April and May and you've heard Paul talk about June and if we looked at the uncertainties in the future, the common denominator we saw was that we needed to maintain a strong balance sheet. But at the same time since we had, I'd say substantial cash flow over the last couple of months not a 100% which is what we wanted, but cash flow we thought it was fair to pay some of that cash flow to the shareholder. The question now was the balance of the two. The balance of the two comes with the sizing of the dividend, which is really a question. And we did that by starting and reviewing a series of financial analyses. We really did dissect possible outcomes through this year and next. And our guiding light was can we come up with a base amount of a dividend build on but at the same time protect against any increase in debt. And those were the two relationships that we work towards. And if you, if I were to try to describe our analyses, I would try to describe them in terms of a V, a U and a W. The V being a quick recovery; U being a slower recovery and perhaps the beginning of the U higher than the end of U and a W where clearly the middle of the W is not going to be equal to the left-hand side of it. I was just reading an article and it's almost the discussion between Minuchin and Powell. Minuchin would say it's a V; Powell would say it's a U or W. We seriously looked at all three of those which is really used on duration and based upon those views, we thought dividend which was $0.077 this quarter represented a sustainable dividend to build on. Now we're not -- we just provided second quarter dividend. We're not approving the third or fourth quarter dividend by any means and clearly if there's any real big disturbance in the economy, we're not sure that base but right now we think that's a very solid base on which to build a dividend. And that build will occur when we think it's appropriate relative to what we're seeing in the environment on a day to day basis.\nOperator: Our next question is from Sheila McGrath from Evercore. Go ahead.\nSheilaMcGrath: Yes. Good afternoon. Welcome back, Glenn. Can you give us give us some perspective on credit loss typically for your portfolio maybe historically over time? And how you view the credit loss for the portfolio in the near term? And just following on that do you expect to be converting some leases to cash accounting in the near term?\nGlennRufrano: Good. I think that those are two very good questions, Sheila and I'm going to pass the first one on credit to Paul and then Paul I would ask you to pass on in terms of accounting to Mike. So Paul, you take that first one.\nPaulMcDowell: Sure. Of course. Hi, Sheila. With respect to credit losses in the portfolio we've been pretty fortunate and that we've had very low credit losses over the past few years. So we haven't had much in the way of credit losses. We have had the few small bankruptcies as you know from time to time and we generally, we've lost that credit but we've also been able to relet the properties and regain cash flows. From a going-forward perspective here, we don't know exactly where this all ends up and as Glenn mentioned in his remarks the key here duration. We went into this pandemic with a credit watch list that generally runs between 2% and 2% of adjusted rents and now suddenly we have a lot of credits in our portfolio that are very healthy companies that are through no fault of their own suddenly under a significant amount of credit stress. And the question is how long does that stress last. We're fortunate in that most of the portfolio is made up of public companies and they've got access to capital. So we're pretty confident that most of our tenants will be able to jump the ditch here and resume being the healthy companies they were before. But it's a little too early to give you a sense at this moment about where we expect credit losses to come to rest since we don't yet know the duration. And I think with that I'll give Mike the accounting question.\nMikeBartolotta: Hi, Sheila. It's Mike. I think the accounting question is really going to come down to the fact that typically before we have the pandemic if we had some deferrals or some changes to any of our leases, we would have treated it as a lease modification under 842, but the FASB came out with what they're calling an expediency because they understood that everyone is going to or many people were going to be dealing with deferral situations and what the new FASB says is the expediency says if you have a situation where you have no real substantial change in the original contracts cash flow, but rather just typically you have a two, three, four months deferral and then you collect that rent, let's say over the next six months or a year so that can be handled under this new expediency and the expediency has a couple of decision points. One is it reasonable that you're going to be able to make that collection during that period. If the answer is yes, you can then simply treat the revenue as you normally would and establish a receivable during those deferral periods and you would record the revenue during the deferral periods as regular revenue, you set up a receivable and your AFFO, your NOI and your normalized EBITDA would all reflect it as if it were included in those amounts which is different than if there was a lease amendment. They do give you the option of something called variable accounting which is very similar to cash accounting. I'm not quite sure why one would want to use that given this other treatment, but you do have to first make a decision about collectability if you think there's some doubt about collectability then you account for it on a cash basis. And then the last option is if you're actually changing the terms of the lease and that could be typically a blend and extended for some reason, someone is getting a month or two of free rent and extreme say for three to five year extension on the lease, you do have to go back and do the normal 842 lease modification accounting. So that decision tree is something we'll be going through every completed transaction and deciding which bucket it belongs in and how we account for it.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jeremy Metz from BMO. Go ahead.\nJeremyMetz: Hey, guys. Paul, I was hoping you could -- two parts. Just one could you give us an update on the latest with Art Van and your boxes there? And then going back to the rent relief request, I guess I'm just curious how you balance the fine line between granting deferrals and not granting. I mean arguably just because someone could pay many retailers see others getting deferral, so how do you balance keeping those tenants healthy, happy and in place so giving others breathing room particularly on the retail and restaurants.\nPaulMcDowell: You just want me to go straight into this, Glenn?\nGlennRufrano: Yes. Go. Paul, yes, I thought Jeremy -- thanks Jeremy for -- he directed it and I should have redirected it to make sure Paul gets it, I don't answer it because Paul, he'll answer that question better than I will.\nPaulMcDowell: Sure. With respect to Art Van, as you may remember we have eight stores, Art Van declared bankruptcy pre Covid and their bankruptcy had nothing to do with Covid. But subsequently they have decided to liquidate. We have got all those stores on the market and we have an LOI in place at the moment with a very experienced operator for four of the eight and had about 70% of the previous rents and the remaining four are on the market. With respect to the delicate balance between how do we manage deferral request from tenants, I touched on it in the script and I think you're accurate in calling it a delicate balance because there's a lot of things at play. We have what is the size of our balance sheet and liquidity and on the one hand what is the size of the tenants' balance sheet and their liquidity on the other. What are their likelihood of getting capital from other sources and we also have tenant relationships to think about how often do we interact with that tenant, how often -- when do we have renewals coming up and so on and so forth. All of those factors come into play. So and I say we've had deferral request across the range. We've had some sort of deferral requests that have been launched from tenants who clearly have got the ability to pay and are just asking for deferrals because everyone else seems to be asking for deferrals. And those we generally just simply deny and then we have other tenants where they're clearly in significant distress. And we have to make a judgment about whether or not we are in a position to really help them. And if we can help them for how much and for how long. And so we make those judgments every day. We have a committee that meets several times a week. I meet with our asset managers virtually every day to talk about each and every one of these. And we go through a committee process and once we make a judgement it goes up and then Mike, Glenn and I make a judgement about what to do.\nJeremyMetz: I appreciate the color. And if I could just go back and ask one follow-up on the Art Van based on your comments that four are going with the very experienced operator. It sounds like this is a different operator than the one we heard a couple of your net lease peers shuck a deal, is that correct? \nPaulMcDowell: That's correct.\nJeremyMetz: All right. And then, Tom, I was just wondering on the deal front, it seems like there are still assets that are out there. You saw some 10.31 money sloshing around that we're hearing about. We're about two months into this, so I just wanted it if any color on what's happening on the ground? Are you seeing deals go under contract and what's the sort of early read on pricing? How much our yields resetting at this point? If there is activity, that's still happening.\nGlennRufrano: You got it, Tom.\nTomRoberts: Sure. So as Glenn mentioned we're on pause as well as most of our peers, so not a lot of activity in the market right now particularly in the retail sector. I just think that's too early to pick up -- pick an impact on the market. Although you did mention there is 10.31 exchange activities in the market which we've been active selling some assets to those type buyers. But despite, by far the strongest product type is industrial which is what we buy in our partnership with our Korean partner. There we've seen some pause in the market but probably just maybe 10%, 20% impact on pricing. Seller expectations have moderated slightly but we think there's going to be activity in that market as well. Office would be the same for single tenant long-term investment grade credits. I think the market is held up pretty well probably in that same price range. And we hope to be active in both those front end partnerships in the second half of the year. We do have a partnership transaction that we announced in our last call. A very large industrial project about 2.3 million square feet at $247 million transaction that we anticipate will close here mid-year. We also have two other builder suits that were under contract with that would close in that third or fourth quarter. So we remain active. They have been impacted by Covid but certainly we hope that both partnerships will be active in the second half of the year. So I think generally too soon too early to tell, but we, I think generally in our space and the industrial and office side and even the investment grade or higher quality retail will have very little impact on pricing, very small.\nJeremyMetz: And so no VEREIT price --sorry, Glenn. Go ahead.\nGlennRufrano: No. I just wanted to make sure, Jeremy, what Tom said I think I misunderstood. Tom you had mentioned 10 to 25 in cap rates and not percent decline.\nTomRoberts: Yes. Very small percent.\nGlennRufrano: I misunderstood, sorry I just misunderstood. \nTomRoberts: 10 or 20 basis point which is far less than 5% impact on pricing and a lot of it just has to do with deal that's in place at the time. How badly does the seller want to sell? But I think generally this type product type is very stable long-term credit leases no matter what the product type is, has held up pretty well I think at this point.\nOperator: Our next question is from Anthony Paolone from J.P. Morgan. Go ahead.\nAnthonyPaolone: Okay. Thanks and glad you are well, Glenn. Question for Paul. You mentioned your view that June should look pretty close to April and May. I was wondering if you could just talk with a little more detail in terms of as you look inside the portfolio and what's happening at the asset level, where things look like they might be improving versus areas of the portfolio where it could be worse if things linger for a few more months like this.\nPaulMcDowell: Sure. Yes. So we're -- we've been building up our point of view about where tenants are coming out. We're very lucky in that most of our portfolio is very steady right. It's necessity based retail. It's office and industrial so most of our cash flows we feel very, very comfortable about. We will continue no matter kind of no matter what then it's really at the margin here where we're looking which tenants have paid, which tenants haven't paid. We're in negotiations with pretty much every single tenant who's asked for a deferral request. So we are talking to them and by talking to them, the asset management teams are able to make a judgment about where they see payment streams coming in the coming months. So we've got April and May under our belts now. We predicted where we thought those would come out. They come out close to where we predicted they would. And so we feel we have pretty decent insight into June, June so far. With respect to areas where we see improvement I think when we look operationally, the most market improvement is in the one that we would like to see improve the most that is in the restaurant portfolio. Initially many of our restaurant tenants were hit very significantly by the pandemic slowdown. And now many of them particularly in the QSR portfolio, sales are only down 10% to 20% which while still very, very significant they can operate profitably at those levels. We've also seen improvement in casual dining. A lot of our tenants didn't really have large to go infrastructures in place or we're just developing them when the pandemic hit. They have hit obviously the fast-forward button on those and it varies across the different brands, but they are improving their to-go performance and so their sales while down initially sort of in the 80% range are now down sort of in the 50% range. So we are seeing some significant cash flow improvements in the casual dining in a casual dining sector so and in the QSR sectors. So I think that's encouraging as we start to open back up.\nAnthonyPaolone: Okay. Thank you for that. And then another question as I look at your expiration schedule. You got a couple points this year about 7% next year, is there any portion of that you know at this point is going to vacate that could be a challenge or that's notable for us?\nGlennRufrano: Yes. I mean nothing particular as you know that we do have 7% coming due next year and we work hard at chipping away at that stuff in advance. So you noticed in my prepared remarks that we had some early renewals and those early renewals actually hits even further out in 2022 and 2023. In 2021m the expirations are pretty granular. We have sort of 180 leases in total that will expire, 70 to 75 each in retail and restaurants. So at this stage, don't see any particularly large holes where we say, oh, we think a large number those will not renew. We will move through the renewal process and we've been doing renewals even during the pandemic and even in some of the restaurants portfolio have been reasonably routine so far. So we'll see how that plays out in the coming months and I think you'll see us beginning to pull our 2021 expirations down as this year as a remainder of 2020 progresses.\nAnthonyPaolone: Okay. Thanks and just last question for, Mike, with about 80% -81% collections seems like it's where you think the quarter will end up. Is anything you need to do from a debt or line covenant point of view that we should watch now for?\nMikeBartolotta: No. We are fine on the covenants. I mentioned that in my remarks and we're fine from that perspective. And we believe that where we are right now, we've drawn down the line so that we have about $600 million of cash and quite $600 million available so we feel comfortable with that mix of having $1.2 billion of liquidity broken into those two pieces. So I don't see any issues on that. We have some debt coming due about $400 million in total this year. Most of that is $320 some-odd million right at the end of December on a convert. So obviously we'll be looking at how we'll refinance that going forward. A month ago the IG markets were BBB or BBB minus, were not as good in the last three weeks or so. They've gotten much better still a little bit pricey, but we have a lot of time between now and then to make that decision plus a lot of liquidity. As we've always tried, we'll keep our options open so that we make the right decision as to how we refining that obligation.\nOperator: Our next question is from Chris Lucas from Capital One Securities. Go ahead.\nChrisLucas: Well. Hey, Glenn. Thanks. It's good to hear your voice and then I guess just generally a couple quick questions for you guys. Mike you mentioned about how you're thinking about the debt that's coming due at the end of the year. If you had to price your long-term debt today what sort of spread over treasuries do you think it would be at?\nMikeBartolotta: I think today we're somewhere for a 10-year or somewhere around $450 million over Treasuries. I mean that there's been kind of a tremendous --the spread between the spreads of say A and BBB plus and then we're a mix of BBB minus and BBB right. We have one BBB and two BBB minus rating. So that's spread within the net lease group is pretty wide. So I would say right now we're somewhere in the 400 range on a 10-year between say 400 --\nGlennRufrano: And, Chris, could I make one comment there because it's a very, very important subject for us in terms of pricing our capital and part of the balancing of the dividend that I discussed earlier. We hope will help us in the debt markets if we have to get into lease markets and we'd like to potentially this year so the spread and our ability to provide more cash flow in the balance sheet, we're hoping we get some momentum that it helps us there.\nChrisLucas: Okay. Thanks for that. And then, Mike, just on the credit facility. Can you remind us is your EBITDA test, is that a single quarter, two quarters, annualized, four quarter trailing, what's that look like?\nMikeBartolotta: It's a quarter annualized right now. That's the way we do the total asset test. You take the NOI and it's a 7% gross up and then you times it by four.\nChrisLucas: Okay. Were -well, and then I guess just going, Paul, maybe on the rent relief mechanics just so I understand them. You're basically offering two to four months then there's like a one-year pay back period. I guess I am just trying to understand when you guys starting to expect the payback period to start? Would it be after the end of the rent relief period or would there be some sort of interim period before that would start up?\nPaulMcDowell: That's a good question and I would say that the answer to that runs the gamut. So, we have a variety of deferral requests and sometimes those deferral requests are for a 100% of rent; sometimes they're for percentages of the rent; 25% or 50% of the rent. We obviously negotiate each and every one and payback periods are sort of the same kind of ilk. Some payback periods we have running almost immediately after the deferral is over. And they run sometimes a pretty short period of time, a couple of months. Other payback periods we have where they start up after a couple of months with the tenant back at their normal rents to give them some breathing room. And build up some capital and then start to pay them again. A few we have deferred out into 2021 at least that's the idea right now, but again it's very, very dependent upon the tenants circumstance; the tenants financial situation and sort of our idea of how quickly we think they will recover and we as mentioned in my remarks too, we typically charge interest on deferral and sometimes that has an impact on the tenants\u2019 desire to pay back their deferred balances more quickly.\nChrisLucas: Okay. Thanks for that. And then I guess just when you're talking to tenants about their rent deferral request does the PPP program or Main Street Lending Program become a prerequisite for that conversation or how is that -- how are you factoring that into the conversation, if at all?\nPaulMcDowell: Yes. No. We do factor it in and as I said before most of our tenants are large public companies or large private companies. So a lot of them except in the restaurant portfolio most didn't really qualify for PPP, but what we have in our agreements that we're working on with our various tenants at the moment is generally if they receive funds from the government that can be earmarked for rent. They need to pay those funds to us in rent and that's not generally controversial as we talk to these tenants. So they say, look, we get money from the government, we're happy to send it to you in the form of rent.\nChrisLucas: Okay. And then my last question just as it relates to the leasing activity particularly the early renewals, were there any sort of rent relief structures that were part of that or is it truly just early renewal type activity?\nPaulMcDowell: No. Yes, the early renewal activity we had was sort of the standard early renewal activity that we have and we mentioned no recapture rates and so and so forth. And so very often when we do what we would call a blended colloquially, a blend and extend. We typically or we occasionally will grant some free rent or some rent reductions upfront in exchange for a much, much longer lease, which gives us obviously an improved net asset value. So sometimes we'll trade a little of upfront rent in exchange for the longer-term lease, but the activity that we had in the first quarter on early renewals in that vein was completely routine.\nOperator: Our next question is from Sheila McGrath from Evercore. Go ahead.\nSheilaMcGrath: I guess I was wondering I know it's early but I was just wondering what your expectations are for pricing on acquisition? Do you expect cap rates to increase despite the low interest rate environment? And do you expect any differentiation between like restaurant or experiential tenants to widen out more than grocery or pharmacy?\nGlennRufrano: Tom, maybe I'll start and then I may kick it to you. Tom as mentioned before which I would agree with retail is really tough. I'm not sure how you would price some of the entertainment properties today or even I'm sure there's some pricing on a grocer-anchored shopping center, but I think that's pretty difficult and I don't think there's a lot of comps there. So I would agree with what Tom said before retail right now if there is a bid-ask, it's wide and so very difficult to figure out. The only assets that I think Tom has been looking at where there is some pricing is investment-grade, industrial and investment-grade office. And Tom, why don't you just kind of come back on those two -- we see those two more often now because we're still looking at them for industrial partnership and our office partnerships. So Tom?\nTomRoberts: Yes. Glenn, I would agree an experiential retail any type of fitness entertainment is just -- there's just not a lot of activity in the market. So I would agree that just not been priced. As Glenn mentioned, we are very active in the industrial and the office fronts with our partners and there again there's not a lot of trades. I think generally unless you really had to sell it you're going to put things on hold for 60-90 days. There has been some transactions that have awarded a bidder and I think as I mentioned earlier probably 10-20 basis point adjustment upward in the cap rate which is a very small percentage below 5%. So we think those are held up really well. I mean just the product types industrial is generally probably the number one product type in the market that has fared very well with e-commerce.  So those prices as you would expect have maintained very strong by comparison. And I think offices as well generally long term, decent credit, and good credit tenants that pricing hasn't moved much. And I think going forward we're obviously on hold and we'll just see where the market goes between now and year end.\nSheilaMcGrath: Okay. Thank you. I guess we need new business interruption insurance.\nGlennRufrano: Well, the ICFC as you probably know, Sheila, is working very hard on that. It's called -- they don't want to call it business interruption insurance because the insurance companies don't want to think of it that way, but so it's called the Recovery Act, a business Recovery Act and we've been before Congress as part of the ICFC. I've been helpful there at least in the last few weeks trying to in the fourth phase of government subsidy, provide for some of what you're asking for. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Glenn Rufrano for closing remarks.\nGlenn Rufrano: I thank everybody for joining us today. And look forward to speaking to many of you over the next few months. We'll talk certainly at NAREIT. And I wish you the best. Thank you very much.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Glenn Rufrano",
            "content": "Thanks Bonni. And thanks for joining us today. The world has changed and while we know that normal first quarter results will not be at the forefront of this call, there are a few quick highlights. AFFO per diluted share for the quarter was $0.17. Year-to-date acquisitions totaled $146 million. In addition, the office partnership acquired a $33 million property of which the company cash contribution was $2.7 million. Dispositions totaled $188 million including the Company's share of dispositions contributed to the office partnership of $70.2 million. As the impact of Covid-19 grew in March, we paused balance sheet acquisitions to better understand the current environment. Net debt to normalize EBITDA was unchanged from last quarter at 5.7x. What have we been thinking about since the quarter end? We are certainly happy that our team together since 2015 executed a number of strategies and transactions as a prerequisite to begin growth in 2020. We believed it was prudent to sell the nontraded REIT business, Cole Capital, greatly reduced the concentration in our largest tenant and generally diversify the portfolio. Settle all outstanding litigation and obtain an investment grade rating balance sheet. Our business model diversifies our capital sources to include institutional partnerships, picking assets which pose no conflict. However, here we are in a disrupted economy. And we now have four overriding goals. Keep our employees safe and provide a work environment and tools to be productive. Recognize the extent of challenges and interact in a collaborative fashion. Maintain the progress we work so hard for especially the resulting investment grade balance sheets and use the business model we built to grow AFFO when the market stabilizes. We understand there are a number of portfolio factors you are interested in and I will let our Chief Operating Officer, Paul McDowell, who has been working closely with our tenants, bring you up to date. Paul? Thanks Mike. Our defined corporate commitment is to always serve to the best of our ability, three main constituencies. Our stakeholders, tenants and employees. Our combined efforts continue to focus on all three. We transitioned our employees to a fully virtual work from home environment in the middle of March quickly new processes and business intelligence tracking tools were developed to assist and monitoring our tenants and potential risks that can come our way. We have a deeply experienced team here at the company not only on the executive management side, but within all of our real estate groups. As leasing and asset management becomes even more important during this time, we have transitioned some of our acquisition personnel as well as others to assist with navigating the challenges our tenants will be facing. Our legal staff, attorneys and paralegals are working to support our efforts. I also said on daily calls where we strive to come up with the best tenant solutions. Every request goes through a process and ends with a sign-off from our investment committee consisting of myself, Paul, Tom and Mike. Our dedicated employee teams have collectively exhibited great energy and resolve and we thank them. Mike presented our current balance sheet statistics. Of note we maintain net debt to EBITDA 5.7x. Our cash and revolving liquidity remains sufficient and our assets are highly liquid with 81% unencumbered. But the exception of our converts later this year. We have no corporate bonds due until 2024. The Board's decision to reduce the dividend for this quarter is not based generally upon a micro review of our business, but more importantly on a macro view when uncertain economy. The difficulty in predicting the duration of this economic disturbance is glaring. Possibilities are extraordinarily wide. When you know where you are, you can better judge what to do and how to do it. While we are getting a better view of tenant receipts with April and May, duration can have a variety of outcomes.  Our view is that with such uncertainties strong balance sheet maintains stakeholder value. The sizing of the dividend was based upon a series of financial analyses, dissecting a range of possible outcomes throughout this year and next. We chose this base amount on which to build the dividend while protecting against any increase in debt. As more information is available in each of the next two quarters, this decision will be under constant review. As you heard in Paul's presentation, our portfolio diversification is serving us well not only by property type, but also investment grade parentage, credit, industry and geographic limits, as well as a high percentage of public companies. We will of course reevaluate the portfolio parameters as we move throughout this year. While we are in a very difficult environment, our business model provides the ability to grow and thrive once we get past this. Although disappointed that 2020 will be a transition year, our experience in transforming the company over the last five years will provide strength to get us through this. Our expectations for the future is that our liquid balance sheet, diversified portfolio, experienced team and partnerships will all perform and reignite hopefully in 2021. Before ending, I would like to applaud those in the healthcare profession and all first responders who have made such a difference in our lives, certainly mine. I also want to take this time to thank everyone for their kind notes during my recovery from the virus. They were great pick me ups, and very much appreciate it. I'll now open the line for questions. Sure. Thank Haendel. And thanks for your kind note. As you know, we -- as you followed us, Haendel, and others we've been pretty disciplined since 2018. The portfolio at that time we generally not understood and so we try to make sure the market understood what we were thinking in the future. We put metrics around a number of elements here, percentages of property type, tenant credit, investment grade rating, geography and a number of others, all to provide diversification. So we have always thought that understanding the portfolio long term is the right thing to do. And we will continue due to that in future. So that's before. Now let's if I took us to just January first and we thought about where our portfolio should be, we'd be saying certain things like experiential real estates a good idea because it's a bridge against e-commerce and restaurants and entertainment is pretty good. We also had a number of conversations on these calls about pharmacies. Well, would pharmacies be best or not be best in the portfolio, that's turned around today. We have all turned around today based upon this pandemic in terms of what property types may or may not perform over periods of time. The one thing that I say for us now thinking about the portfolio is that we're not going to make decisions based upon what's happened today. We're in the middle of the storm. We're going to wait for some of this storm to subside before we make decisions on where the metrics will be and how we will reshape the portfolio. I believe there will be some reshaping but how we will shape is very hard for us to judge right now. To your point some property types like office are now performing well. Our industrial performance is very good and the only thing -- the only constant denominator that I can take out of what's happened over the last five to six years is that diversification is a plus, will always be diversified but we may change some of our metrics in the future. We're just not ready to do that yet, Haendel. No, good, another good question. Certainly that was a difference this quarter. The first, I'd say it's not easy -- it's not an easy decision to reduce a dividend, it's just not. Make your feet burn and your stomachs turn when you have to make a decision like that but we as a company and the board thought it was necessary to make that decision. The decision itself as I mentioned wasn't only based upon the macro review what's happening today, it's more importantly it was really based upon the uncertainty of what's happening in the economy. It's a very difficult to predict duration here and we have -- will all have a hard time on duration and that will play a very important role in what and how our tenants will run their businesses. But what we decided was that we would take a look at various outcomes of what can happen over the next year or two. We have a basis in April and May which is helpful that it was better than the sort of April. I'm not sure we knew what was going to happen. We have a better feel for April and May and you've heard Paul talk about June and if we looked at the uncertainties in the future, the common denominator we saw was that we needed to maintain a strong balance sheet. But at the same time since we had, I'd say substantial cash flow over the last couple of months not a 100% which is what we wanted, but cash flow we thought it was fair to pay some of that cash flow to the shareholder. The question now was the balance of the two. The balance of the two comes with the sizing of the dividend, which is really a question. And we did that by starting and reviewing a series of financial analyses. We really did dissect possible outcomes through this year and next. And our guiding light was can we come up with a base amount of a dividend build on but at the same time protect against any increase in debt. And those were the two relationships that we work towards. And if you, if I were to try to describe our analyses, I would try to describe them in terms of a V, a U and a W. The V being a quick recovery; U being a slower recovery and perhaps the beginning of the U higher than the end of U and a W where clearly the middle of the W is not going to be equal to the left-hand side of it. I was just reading an article and it's almost the discussion between Minuchin and Powell. Minuchin would say it's a V; Powell would say it's a U or W. We seriously looked at all three of those which is really used on duration and based upon those views, we thought dividend which was $0.077 this quarter represented a sustainable dividend to build on. Now we're not -- we just provided second quarter dividend. We're not approving the third or fourth quarter dividend by any means and clearly if there's any real big disturbance in the economy, we're not sure that base but right now we think that's a very solid base on which to build a dividend. And that build will occur when we think it's appropriate relative to what we're seeing in the environment on a day to day basis. Good. I think that those are two very good questions, Sheila and I'm going to pass the first one on credit to Paul and then Paul I would ask you to pass on in terms of accounting to Mike. So Paul, you take that first one. Yes. Go. Paul, yes, I thought Jeremy -- thanks Jeremy for -- he directed it and I should have redirected it to make sure Paul gets it, I don't answer it because Paul, he'll answer that question better than I will. You got it, Tom. No. I just wanted to make sure, Jeremy, what Tom said I think I misunderstood. Tom you had mentioned 10 to 25 in cap rates and not percent decline. I misunderstood, sorry I just misunderstood. Yes. I mean nothing particular as you know that we do have 7% coming due next year and we work hard at chipping away at that stuff in advance. So you noticed in my prepared remarks that we had some early renewals and those early renewals actually hits even further out in 2022 and 2023. In 2021m the expirations are pretty granular. We have sort of 180 leases in total that will expire, 70 to 75 each in retail and restaurants. So at this stage, don't see any particularly large holes where we say, oh, we think a large number those will not renew. We will move through the renewal process and we've been doing renewals even during the pandemic and even in some of the restaurants portfolio have been reasonably routine so far. So we'll see how that plays out in the coming months and I think you'll see us beginning to pull our 2021 expirations down as this year as a remainder of 2020 progresses. And, Chris, could I make one comment there because it's a very, very important subject for us in terms of pricing our capital and part of the balancing of the dividend that I discussed earlier. We hope will help us in the debt markets if we have to get into lease markets and we'd like to potentially this year so the spread and our ability to provide more cash flow in the balance sheet, we're hoping we get some momentum that it helps us there. Tom, maybe I'll start and then I may kick it to you. Tom as mentioned before which I would agree with retail is really tough. I'm not sure how you would price some of the entertainment properties today or even I'm sure there's some pricing on a grocer-anchored shopping center, but I think that's pretty difficult and I don't think there's a lot of comps there.

And Tom, why don't you just kind of come back on those two -- we see those two more often now because we're still looking at them for industrial partnership and our office partnerships. So Tom? Well, the ICFC as you probably know, Sheila, is working very hard on that. It's called -- they don't want to call it business interruption insurance because the insurance companies don't want to think of it that way, but so it's called the Recovery Act, a business Recovery Act and we've been before Congress as part of the ICFC. I've been helpful there at least in the last few weeks trying to in the fourth phase of government subsidy, provide for some of what you're asking for. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Glenn Rufrano for closing remarks. I thank everybody for joining us today. And look forward to speaking to many of you over the next few months. We'll talk certainly at NAREIT. And I wish you the best. Thank you very much."

            "content": "Thanks Glenn. As already mentioned, we know the focal point for this call is how the portfolio is performing during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, our teams are still very focused on normal asset management which is also very important. Leasing for the quarter was very strong with over 2 million square feet leased of which 1.4 million square feet were early renewals. Total activity included 1.3 million square feet of industrial, 498,000 square feet of office; a 190,000 square feet of retail and 73,000 square feet of restaurants. For renewal leases, we recaptured approximately 94% of prior rents on an initial cash basis. And many of these newly extended leases have additional built in rent increases. Importantly, we were able to finalize leases we had in process prior to the pandemic disruption along with some dispositions and some of that activity has carried further into Q2. Occupancy ended the quarter at a healthy 99.1%. Now let's talk more specifically about our portfolio performance and where we are today. Our April rent receipt came in at 81% and so far rent for May is at 78% which includes 2% to be paid from a government agency tenant that pays in arrears. The underpinnings of these relatively strong collection results were driven by our property type diversification, industry breakdown, investment grade tenancy; public versus private ownership and geographic diversity. Our allocation to office, industrial and necessity based retail including our top industry exposures such as discount, pharmacy, grocery warehouse clubs and convenience has helped in our rental collection. Overall, 17 of our Top 20 tenants effectively paid full rent in April. In May so far 16 of our Top 20 tenants have paid rent.  Or approximately 37% of investment-grade tenancy for the total portfolio and 46% within retail were a strong component of April rent collections at almost a 100%. And well over 95% so far in May. Over 60% of our tenants are public in the overall portfolio and over 68% are public within the retail portfolio which we view very positively. Fortunately, we have a lot of geographic diversity with many of our properties spread out in areas of the country that have had less impact from the virus and many are in states that have started to reopen for business. Although, they remain a patchwork of restrictions based on regions of the country open now or opening soon in some capacity, we have 3,393 properties or 88% in these open locations. Only about 9.6% of our portfolio is in the hard-hit northeast with 2.3% and 3.1% in the hardest-hit states of New York and New Jersey respectively. The largest real estate teams in our company have always been our strong and our very experienced asset management and property management departments, which have served us well. These teams have been augmented in the past two months with personnel from underwriting and acquisitions. Collectively, they have been doing an outstanding job in trying circumstances and our collections to date are partially reflective of those efforts. And I will take this opportunity to thank them. Our dedicated property type asset management teams have been in discussion with our tenants to understand the impact of Covid-19 on their businesses. Rent relief requests have been received from tenants representing approximately 34% of rental income on an annualized basis. We have been evaluating each request on a case-by-case basis based on each tenant's unique financial and operating situation, analyzing metrics such as industry segments, geographic locations where they are operating; corporate financial health, rent coverage and the tenants' liquidity. Our goal has been to help those tenants we think need and deserve it in the short run, while at the same time pressing for payment from those tenants who we judge do not merit rent relief, have access to other forms of capital or being opportunistic. Of the received requests to date, a little over a third have been approved, about a third are in negotiations and about a third have either been denied or we have taken no action. The deferral agreements we have made generally have been in a two to four month range and pay back within 12-months with interest as appropriate. While we have generally structured any rent relief as deferral not abatement, in a small number of cases we have created rent per term for tenants we think will be here in the long term and where we think we've created value in a longer lease. It is worth noting again that the vast majority of our ARI comes from large public and private companies that have the financial resources and access to capital necessary to weather this storm. We do, however, have some smaller tenants and so we've also been monitoring the various government assistance programs, which we think can be helpful to some of our most impacted industries such as franchise restaurants and entertainment related retail. About half of the tenants with in the restaurant portfolio have applied to the Paycheck Protection Program and we expect some amount will have access to these funds. We also have been monitoring the new governmental initiatives such as the Main Street Lending Program which may help some of our larger tenants. Finally, as I noted above rent collections so far for May are 78% which is about 1% ahead of where we were during the same time period in April. As others have pointed out, many tenants went into April with some momentum from the first quarter with May be in the month where the full impact of the shutdown has been felt. With that in mind, we are very gratified with our collection levels so far for May. Our current expectation is that total collections for May will be approximately where April ended. Industrial is so far coming in a bit lower than April primarily to one tenant which paid in April and we believe can continue to pay. We are currently in discussions with that tenant. At this point, we think June collections will be in the range of collections for April and May. Further portfolio segment information and details can be found in our Investor presentation file today. I will now turn the call over to Mike. Mike? Sure. Of course. Hi, Sheila. With respect to credit losses in the portfolio we've been pretty fortunate and that we've had very low credit losses over the past few years. So we haven't had much in the way of credit losses. We have had the few small bankruptcies as you know from time to time and we generally, we've lost that credit but we've also been able to relet the properties and regain cash flows. From a going-forward perspective here, we don't know exactly where this all ends up and as Glenn mentioned in his remarks the key here duration. We went into this pandemic with a credit watch list that generally runs between 2% and 2% of adjusted rents and now suddenly we have a lot of credits in our portfolio that are very healthy companies that are through no fault of their own suddenly under a significant amount of credit stress. And the question is how long does that stress last. We're fortunate in that most of the portfolio is made up of public companies and they've got access to capital. So we're pretty confident that most of our tenants will be able to jump the ditch here and resume being the healthy companies they were before. But it's a little too early to give you a sense at this moment about where we expect credit losses to come to rest since we don't yet know the duration. And I think with that I'll give Mike the accounting question. You just want me to go straight into this, Glenn? Sure. With respect to Art Van, as you may remember we have eight stores, Art Van declared bankruptcy pre Covid and their bankruptcy had nothing to do with Covid. But subsequently they have decided to liquidate. We have got all those stores on the market and we have an LOI in place at the moment with a very experienced operator for four of the eight and had about 70% of the previous rents and the remaining four are on the market. With respect to the delicate balance between how do we manage deferral request from tenants, I touched on it in the script and I think you're accurate in calling it a delicate balance because there's a lot of things at play. We have what is the size of our balance sheet and liquidity and on the one hand what is the size of the tenants' balance sheet and their liquidity on the other. What are their likelihood of getting capital from other sources and we also have tenant relationships to think about how often do we interact with that tenant, how often -- when do we have renewals coming up and so on and so forth. All of those factors come into play. So and I say we've had deferral request across the range. We've had some sort of deferral requests that have been launched from tenants who clearly have got the ability to pay and are just asking for deferrals because everyone else seems to be asking for deferrals. And those we generally just simply deny and then we have other tenants where they're clearly in significant distress. And we have to make a judgment about whether or not we are in a position to really help them. And if we can help them for how much and for how long. And so we make those judgments every day. We have a committee that meets several times a week. I meet with our asset managers virtually every day to talk about each and every one of these. And we go through a committee process and once we make a judgement it goes up and then Mike, Glenn and I make a judgement about what to do. That's correct. Sure. Yes. So we're -- we've been building up our point of view about where tenants are coming out. We're very lucky in that most of our portfolio is very steady right. It's necessity based retail. It's office and industrial so most of our cash flows we feel very, very comfortable about. We will continue no matter kind of no matter what then it's really at the margin here where we're looking which tenants have paid, which tenants haven't paid. We're in negotiations with pretty much every single tenant who's asked for a deferral request. So we are talking to them and by talking to them, the asset management teams are able to make a judgment about where they see payment streams coming in the coming months. So we've got April and May under our belts now. We predicted where we thought those would come out. They come out close to where we predicted they would. And so we feel we have pretty decent insight into June, June so far. With respect to areas where we see improvement I think when we look operationally, the most market improvement is in the one that we would like to see improve the most that is in the restaurant portfolio. Initially many of our restaurant tenants were hit very significantly by the pandemic slowdown. And now many of them particularly in the QSR portfolio, sales are only down 10% to 20% which while still very, very significant they can operate profitably at those levels. We've also seen improvement in casual dining. A lot of our tenants didn't really have large to go infrastructures in place or we're just developing them when the pandemic hit. They have hit obviously the fast-forward button on those and it varies across the different brands, but they are improving their to-go performance and so their sales while down initially sort of in the 80% range are now down sort of in the 50% range. So we are seeing some significant cash flow improvements in the casual dining in a casual dining sector so and in the QSR sectors. So I think that's encouraging as we start to open back up. That's a good question and I would say that the answer to that runs the gamut. So, we have a variety of deferral requests and sometimes those deferral requests are for a 100% of rent; sometimes they're for percentages of the rent; 25% or 50% of the rent. We obviously negotiate each and every one and payback periods are sort of the same kind of ilk. Some payback periods we have running almost immediately after the deferral is over. And they run sometimes a pretty short period of time, a couple of months. Other payback periods we have where they start up after a couple of months with the tenant back at their normal rents to give them some breathing room. And build up some capital and then start to pay them again. A few we have deferred out into 2021 at least that's the idea right now, but again it's very, very dependent upon the tenants circumstance; the tenants financial situation and sort of our idea of how quickly we think they will recover and we as mentioned in my remarks too, we typically charge interest on deferral and sometimes that has an impact on the tenants' desire to pay back their deferred balances more quickly. Yes. No. We do factor it in and as I said before most of our tenants are large public companies or large private companies. So a lot of them except in the restaurant portfolio most didn't really qualify for PPP, but what we have in our agreements that we're working on with our various tenants at the moment is generally if they receive funds from the government that can be earmarked for rent. They need to pay those funds to us in rent and that's not generally controversial as we talk to these tenants. So they say, look, we get money from the government, we're happy to send it to you in the form of rent. No. Yes, the early renewal activity we had was sort of the standard early renewal activity that we have and we mentioned no recapture rates and so and so forth. And so very often when we do what we would call a blended colloquially, a blend and extend. We typically or we occasionally will grant some free rent or some rent reductions upfront in exchange for a much, much longer lease, which gives us obviously an improved net asset value. So sometimes we'll trade a little of upfront rent in exchange for the longer-term lease, but the activity that we had in the first quarter on early renewals in that vein was completely routine."

            "name": "Mike Bartolotta",
            "content": "Thanks Paul and thank you all for joining us today. Our first quarter numbers really were on target. However, we recognize that going forward for some time it's a different environment and what's most important is our balance sheet and liquidity. Before I get into that though let me quickly discuss how we prepared as a company to ensure the smoothest transition to our virtual environment. We're currently operating essentially 100% remotely. Anticipating that an office shutdown was probable, our IT team quickly mobilized our business continuity plans and made sure we had equipment for all employees who are able to work effectively from home. Employees are utilizing virtual private networks in their homes to maintain a high level of security and we prepared training and awareness materials for employees to help them get set up and they continue to have access to a 24x7 IT support desk. In addition, the management committee participates in daily virtual meetings to make sure the business is operating efficiently. I've been impressed with how well everyone has been able to adapt during this difficult period and I'd like to thank our entire team for all of their efforts in keeping the business running as normal as possible. Turning to our balance sheet now. The company remains well positions with net debt to normalize EBITDA unchanged from year-end at 5.7x. A key focal point for us as a company has been maintaining a strong and liquid balance sheet and we worked very hard over the last few years to gain back our investment grade rating. As Covid-19 pandemic continued to unfold, we initiated an additional draw in excess of normal operating requirements of $600 million on our revolving line of credit to enhance our cash position. As of May 15, VEREIT had corporate liquidity of approximately $1.2 billion comprised of $601 million in cash and cash equivalents and $588 million of availability under our credit facility. Our fixed charge coverage ratio remained healthy increasing to 3.3x and our net debt to gross real estate investment ratio was 39%. Our unencumbered asset ratio increased to 81%; the weighted average duration of our debt was 4.4 years and we are 86% fixed, which reflects the higher utilization of our line of credit this quarter. Additionally, we a very manageable amount of debt coming due in the near term. As of quarter end, we had $90 million in mortgage notes payable due this year at a weighted average interest rate of approximately 5%. And we had a $322 million convertible bond due at the end of December. In 2021, we have $299 million in mortgage notes payable due throughout next year but no other corporate bonds coming due until 2024j. Based on what I see now, we see no issues with our covenants. Moving to our outlook. We withdrew guidance in April and are not providing an update at this time due to the uncertain market we all face; the Board of Directors is reducing the second quarter dividend from $0.1375 to $0.077 representing a decrease of 44%. The reduction was determined after extensive financial analysis. This allows us to prudently manage our debt levels and the balance sheet stability we work so hard for over the last five years. Board of Directors has not made any decisions with respect to its dividend policy beyond the second quarter and we'll continue to monitor the current environment and its impact on our tenants and business. Based on our estimate of taxable net income today, we see no issues with this reduction and satisfy our REIT requirements. And with that I will turn the call back to Glenn. Hi, Sheila. It's Mike. I think the accounting question is really going to come down to the fact that typically before we have the pandemic if we had some deferrals or some changes to any of our leases, we would have treated it as a lease modification under 842, but the FASB came out with what they're calling an expediency because they understood that everyone is going to or many people were going to be dealing with deferral situations and what the new FASB says is the expediency says if you have a situation where you have no real substantial change in the original contracts cash flow, but rather just typically you have a two, three, four months deferral and then you collect that rent, let's say over the next six months or a year so that can be handled under this new expediency and the expediency has a couple of decision points. One is it reasonable that you're going to be able to make that collection during that period. If the answer is yes, you can then simply treat the revenue as you normally would and establish a receivable during those deferral periods and you would record the revenue during the deferral periods as regular revenue, you set up a receivable and your AFFO, your NOI and your normalized EBITDA would all reflect it as if it were included in those amounts which is different than if there was a lease amendment. They do give you the option of something called variable accounting which is very similar to cash accounting. I'm not quite sure why one would want to use that given this other treatment, but you do have to first make a decision about collectability if you think there's some doubt about collectability then you account for it on a cash basis. And then the last option is if you're actually changing the terms of the lease and that could be typically a blend and extended for some reason, someone is getting a month or two of free rent and extreme say for three to five year extension on the lease, you do have to go back and do the normal 842 lease modification accounting. So that decision tree is something we'll be going through every completed transaction and deciding which bucket it belongs in and how we account for it. No. We are fine on the covenants. I mentioned that in my remarks and we're fine from that perspective. And we believe that where we are right now, we've drawn down the line so that we have about $600 million of cash and quite $600 million available so we feel comfortable with that mix of having $1.2 billion of liquidity broken into those two pieces. So I don't see any issues on that. We have some debt coming due about $400 million in total this year. Most of that is $320 some-odd million right at the end of December on a convert. So obviously we'll be looking at how we'll refinance that going forward. A month ago the IG markets were BBB or BBB minus, were not as good in the last three weeks or so. They've gotten much better still a little bit pricey, but we have a lot of time between now and then to make that decision plus a lot of liquidity. As we've always tried, we'll keep our options open so that we make the right decision as to how we refining that obligation. I think today we're somewhere for a 10-year or somewhere around $450 million over Treasuries. I mean that there's been kind of a tremendous --the spread between the spreads of say A and BBB plus and then we're a mix of BBB minus and BBB right. We have one BBB and two BBB minus rating. So that's spread within the net lease group is pretty wide. So I would say right now we're somewhere in the 400 range on a 10-year between say 400 -- It's a quarter annualized right now. That's the way we do the total asset test. You take the NOI and it's a 7% gross up and then you times it by four."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Realty Income's Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2021 Operating [Technical Difficulty]. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Julie Hasselwander, Senior Manager, Investor Relations at Realty Income. You may begin.\nJulie Hasselwander: Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's Fourth Quarter and 2021 Year-End Operating Results Conference Call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Christie Kelly, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements.  We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company's Form 10-K. [Operator Instructions]..  I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy.\nSumit Roy: Thanks, Julie. Welcome, everyone. As I reflect on the past year at Realty Income, I remain inspired by the dedication of our colleagues who continue to relentlessly pursue numerous profitable growth initiatives while contributing to a record year of acquisitions for our company.  During the fourth quarter, we closed on the merger with VEREIT, welcoming many talented new colleagues that will further help drive our ambitious goals while amplifying our competitive position in the industry. We are committed to a seamless and successful transition as we collectively work to integrate our one team, processes and systems. We remain on track to achieve over 75% of our annualized G&A cost synergies in year one post-merger, as we outlined upon announcing the merger in April of last year. Specifically, we have achieved over $42 million of our $37.5 million targeted synergies in year one, representing full year 2022, with over $50 million in G&A synergies expected in year two, representing full year 2023. Also, I continue to be impressed by the talent and dedication of our new team members as we work to integrate our two platforms and further strengthen our one team. And while we creatively bring together the best practices of VEREIT and Realty Income with our integration efforts to productively scale our operations, I'm encouraged by our integration work completed to date and our journey ahead.  Beyond the merger, our business set a quarterly record for investment volume in the fourth quarter. During the quarter, we strengthened our foothold in Spain through additional high-quality acquisitions, including our second acquisition of properties leased to a key partner in Carrefour, one of the world's leading grocery retailers.  Our strategic expansion into Continental Europe meaningfully increases our total addressable universe, as we estimate the total addressable market in Europe to be $8 trillion, nearly double that of the U.S. We expect our investment activity in Europe to continue contributing to our competitive cost of capital as we look to further hedge our currency risk with debt priced at meaningfully lower yields than in the U.S.  Looking forward, we are well positioned to continue creating value by capitalizing on our portable competitive advantages globally to deliver favorable risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. With regards to recent developments, as previously disclosed this month, we announced our intent to acquire the Encore Boston Harbor, the East Coast's leading integrated resort and casino located less than 5 miles from downtown Boston. The $1.7 billion acquisition is being consummated at a 5.9% cash cap rate with a 30-year initial lease term. The property represents our first investment in the gaming industry and would represent less than 3.5% of our pro forma annual rent. While the property type is new, the lens we use to pursue the merits of the transaction is not. Our investment strategy centers around partnership with best-in-class operators occupying high-quality real estate locations, which is particularly important when entering a new business vertical and geography. We followed this strategy with the Diageo sale leaseback in 2010 when executing our first transaction in the Vineyard space, with the Sainsbury's sale leaseback in 2019 when expanding our business internationally. And more recently, with the Carrefour sale leaseback when we entered into Spain last year.  Our debut transaction in the gaming industry with Wynn Resorts represents the same commitment to partnering with the premier leaders in the respective industries together with a commitment to our overall investment strategy. The Encore Boston Harbor acquisition will add further diversification to our industry and client roster. After closing this transaction, we expect Wynn Resorts will become one of our top 10 clients. Our capacity to pursue and absorb a transaction of this size with a single client was supported by the enhanced size and scale that we gained through the VEREIT merger. And it is a testament to our ability to complete large-scale transactions without significantly impacting our prudent portfolio diversification metrics.  The Encore Boston Harbor transaction meets our key investment criteria and illustrates that our investment opportunity set is not constrained by a particular property type. The merits of this transaction are first, the real estate. We're acquiring 3.1 million square feet of high-quality real estate strategically located on the banks of the Mystic River. After opening in 2019, the property is still ramping but already generates $210 million in annual EBITDAR, resulting in 2.1x rent coverage initially.  Second, the client lease. We are entering into a 30-year triple net lease with attractive annual rent escalators at 1.75% annually for the first 10 years and the greater of 1.75% or CPI thereafter capped at 2.5%. Wynn Resorts is one of the largest premier gaming operators in the U.S. with an enterprise value of approximately $20 billion. They maintain a healthy balance sheet, moderate leverage and significant liquidity. Third, the industry performance. The gaming industry in the U.S. has recovered to pre-COVID levels. And in Massachusetts, gaming revenues grew 17% in the fourth quarter of 2021 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, outperforming the aggregate regional gaming market that grew 8% during the same time frame. Pending regulatory procedures, we expect to close the transaction in the fourth quarter of 2022. Craig and his team have been a pleasure to work with, and we are pleased to cultivate this new relationship with Wynn Resorts as we expand our universe of net lease investments across many industries. Now turning to the results for the quarter. We are pleased with the continued strength of our core operations. We ended the quarter with our portfolio at 98.5% occupancy based on property count. Bolstered by the inherent quality of our real estate and enhanced by the proactive efforts of our talented and experienced asset management team, we re-leased 232 leases this quarter, recapturing 101.8% of expiring rent and bringing our full year 2021 recapture rate to 103.4%.  Since our public listing in 1994, we have executed over 4,100 re-leases or sales on expiring leases, recapturing over 100% of rent on those re-leased contracts. We continue to report our quarterly recapture rates and believe this is one of the most objective ways to measure underlying portfolio quality in the net lease industry and is a testament to the merit of our asset management team.  After closing the VEREIT merger, we look forward with an enhanced key competitive advantage of size and scale. With an enterprise value of more than $57 billion, our portfolio now includes over 11,100 properties leased to approximately 1,040 clients in the United States and Europe across a diversified set of 60 distinct industries.  Our total portfolio annualized contractual rent increased by over 50% since the end of the third quarter, ending the year at over $2.9 billion. With our expanded size and scale, we have greater client and industry diversification, which further improves our competitive positioning to pursue large portfolio or sale-leaseback transactions in the fragmented net lease industry and be a one-stop solution for multibillion-dollar opportunities. Since the end of the third quarter, our top 10 client concentration has decreased to 29.1% from 34.8%, and we believe it represents one of the highest quality portfolios in the net lease industry. Additionally, our top industry concentration has decreased, creating additional investment capacity. Our top 5 industries now comprise 40% of our annualized contractual rent compared to over 43% at the end of the third quarter and a top industry exposure, which includes convenience stores and grocery stores have declined meaningfully. With the growth in concentration of our targeted industries, theater and health and fitness industry concentrations have naturally declined. In terms of the casual dining contribution from our VEREIT merger, the majority of their concentration is with Red Lobster that has experienced improved operating performance is now owned by Thai Union an established strong financial sponsor.  Our international geographic concentration also declined pursuant to our VEREIT transaction, providing further room to achieve profitable growth in Europe and beyond. We have already started to see the benefits of our expanded platform through increased sourcing and acquisition volume. In 2021, we sourced approximately $84.5 billion of acquisition opportunities and approximately 39% was sourced from international markets. Reflecting our stringent investment criteria, we closed on approximately 8% of the total opportunities, bringing our total 2021 property level acquisitions to $6.4 billion, an annual record for our company. Of the $6.4 billion invested in 2021, over 40% or approximately $2.6 billion was invested during the fourth quarter. Over $1 billion of our volume in the fourth quarter was the result of international investments, bringing our total international portfolio to nearly $4.3 billion of invested capital at the end of the year. We believe the market is efficient, and we're experiencing a competitive environment for high-quality assets leased to strong operators. Accordingly, the quality of our acquisition is reflected in our average initial cash cap rate during the fourth quarter of 5.4% and 5.5% for the year.  The largest industries represented in our fourth quarter acquisition were European grocery stores and U.S. automotive services, which represent a continued investment in industries well positioned to perform in a variety of economic cycles, given its necessity-based retail proposition for consumers. The weighted average remaining lease term of assets added to our portfolio during the quarter was 14.2 years. We continue to generate healthy investment spreads of approximately 140 basis points during the quarter and 150 basis points during the year, consistent with our historical average, while acquiring, in our view, the highest quality product in the marketplace.  Inflation has been an important topic to investors in the last few months. I want to emphasize that we believe our business is, by design, well positioned to drive shareholder value in this climate.  From a balance sheet perspective, having a well-staggered fixed-rate debt maturity schedule with no corporate bond maturities until 2024, limits our debt refinancing risk in a potentially rising rate environment. And we believe we actually benefit from an inflationary environment given our lease expiration schedule and our proven ability to recapture more than the value of expiring rent upon re-leasing.  Finally, the value of our business is largely tied to current income as a recurring cash flow vehicle, which makes the value proposition of owning realty income comparatively more attractive during inflationary periods, as compared to other sectors in the marketplace whose value is high to growth in future years.  At this time, I'll pass it over to Christie, who will further discuss results from the quarter.\nChristie Kelly: Thank you, Sumit. We continue to prioritize a conservative balance sheet structure while procuring attractively priced capital. During the quarter, our capital markets activity was highlighted by the issuance of over $1.7 billion of equity, primarily through our ATM program, which enabled us to simultaneously complete the VEREIT merger and finance a record quarter for acquisitions while finishing the year within our targeted leverage parameters. As we emphasized when we announced the merger in April, we intended to close the transaction in a leverage-neutral manner relative to our target leverage level, which we are pleased to have accomplished. One of the benefits of our enhanced size and scale is daily trading liquidity in our stock that provides us with the ability to issue significant amounts of equity through the ATM in a cost-efficient manner without disrupting the market price of our stock.  As a result, we entered 2022 from a position of strength with a net debt to annualized pro forma adjusted EBITDAR of 5.3x. Subsequent to year-end, we issued $500 million in sterling-denominated senior unsecured notes, pricing 5-year and 20-year notes at a blended all-in yield of 2.28%, with a weighted average term of 12.5 years.  This was the third sterling-denominated debt offering we have priced in the last 16 months, and we could not be more appreciative of the support we have received from the Sterling fixed income investor base.  Moving on to the financial results for the quarter. In fourth quarter, our business generated $0.94 of AFFO per share, supported by our healthy portfolio, closing of the VEREIT merger, strong acquisition pace and collection of almost 100% of contractual rent during the fourth quarter. Going forward, we will no longer be providing COVID-19 disclosures as we believe portfolio operating performance has returned to pre-pandemic levels in terms of overall collection. In 2021, our business generated $3.59 of AFFO per share, finishing near the high end of guidance and representing 5.9% annual growth. Given the health of our portfolio and our active global investment pipeline, we remain comfortable with our previously announced 2022 AFFO per share guidance of $3.84 to $3.97, representing 8.8% annual growth at the midpoint.  Realty Income was founded on the principles of income generation and capital preservation. We remain committed to delivering monthly dividends that increase over time as part of a consistently attractive total shareholder return proposition. In December, we were pleased to have increased our dividend by 5.1% as compared to the same period last year. The increase in the dividend was intended to share with our shareholders, the accretion from the recently closed VEREIT merger, together with continued earnings accretion that we were able to generate throughout the year from our business.  We have now increased the dividend 114x since our 1994 listing and remain proud to be 1 of only 3 REITs in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index for having raised our dividend for at least 25 consecutive years.  Now I would like to hand the call back to Sumit.\nSumit Roy: Thank you, Christie. We remain humbled by our collective accomplishments in 2021, including the completion of the merger, but also with the strength of our full year results and our attention now turns to the path forward.  Realty Income has a bright outlook for 2022 and beyond, and we look forward to continuing to build a strong and resilient platform as we embrace the opportunities that lie ahead. As we enter a new year of possibilities, we remain steadfast in our purpose of building enduring relationships and brighter financial futures, while relentlessly pursuing ways to provide shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns over the long run.  At this time, I'd like to open it up for any questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nBradley Heffern: Can you talk quickly about how you got comfortable with the risk profile of the Wynn acquisition? Obviously, it's a very large single asset. There are some different regulatory risks involved. So do you see that as being fully compensated for by the higher cap rate and the higher escalators?\nSumit Roy: Yes. The short answer, Brad, is yes, we do. For us, our thesis is quite simple. We want to try to partner with the best-in-class operators and get the premier assets that they operate. If you look at the Boston Harbor asset, it is the premier superregional asset in the United States. If you look at the coverage, and this is an asset that is still not fully stabilized, it's at 2.1x. If you think about Wynn, they are an S&P 500 company that is arguably the best operator in the space. If you look at regional gaming and compare it to the volatility associated with the strip, it tends to be a lot less volatile. And more specifically, if you look at the Massachusetts market, which has grown at almost 18% in the fourth quarter of 2021. Even compared to the national average on the gaming side, it was almost 2x that.  If you look at the actual asset itself and you see what we've paid for the asset and compare it to what was actually invested in the asset, and these are all public numbers, you'll start to get very comfortable with the fact that we feel very comfortable about what we've paid in terms of replacement cost.  And we've been very open with the market with respect to our desire to continue to explore new avenues of growth and this is one that completely fits that profile of trying to partner with the best-in-class operators and trying to add best-in-class real estate to our portfolio.  If you look at the lease structure, it's a 30-year lease with growth that is in excess of what we are able to generate on the rest of the portfolio. And those are the reasons why we felt this was the right opportunity for us to sort of enter into the gaming space, with the right operator as a partner and with the right asset.\nBradley Heffern: Okay. Thanks for that. And sticking with Wynn, if you did another transaction with them of the same size, obviously, that would likely make them the #1 client. So how do you think about the future of gaming? Is it likely that we'll see another transaction with Wynn? Is it likely that we'll see another one with another operator?\nSumit Roy: Look, we did our first transaction in this particular space. So we are very hopeful that we can continue to grow this area. And as long as we feel like we can structure transactions for the right properties with the right operators, we are very happy to grow this area of our business. We've been very open with the market about playing across the risk spectrum with regards to yield, and yield for us is a proxy for the risk associated with it.  And if we feel like on a risk-adjusted basis, we're able to grow our portfolio even within gaming, we'll be very happy to do so. We continue to talk about how important partnerships are for us and Wynn is that. It's a long-term partner. And in the event they decide that they would like to pursue other transactions, we would like to be there for them and continue to grow our exposure to gaming and in particular, our exposure to Wynn.\nOperator: The next question is from Nate Crossett with Berenberg. Your line is open.\nNathan Crossett: Maybe just following up on those questions a bit. Can you tell us anything about -- was this a competitive bid process? How many bidders? How many rounds? And then I'm assuming there's no other gaming assets in the pipeline right now, but is there a way you could confirm or deny that?\nSumit Roy: I'm not going to answer your second question. But the first one, there was no process. This is -- like we said, we emphasize relationship above all else. And we wanted to partner with Wynn. And this came about through a conversation that started towards the end of last year. And so there were no rounds. There were no other folks. It was purely a relationship-driven transaction.\nNathan Crossett: Okay. Interesting. Thank you. Maybe just a question on pricing more broadly. Cap rates continue to come down. I think the commentary across the space is that there remains a lot of pressure there, even with funding costs kind of going up. So what are you kind of seeing, I guess, in your pipeline right now? And what's kind of your expectation, I guess, for the numerator side of the equation this year?\nSumit Roy: Yes. That's a very interesting question, Nate. We continue to see a very aggressive cap rate market, especially for the type of products that we are pursuing. We would have thought that given the fact that we've been in this -- expectation of higher inflation, higher interest rate environment that would start to sort of percolate into the rest of the acquisitions market, we haven't seen that yet.  Now history would suggest that cap rates do tend to adjust, especially if some of these increases become more than just an expectation. But at least the current market situation is one where we are not seeing even a stabilization of the cap rate, we continue to see downward pressure.  And this is where being able to partner and lean on relationships, et cetera, is going to allow us to potentially get that 5, 10, 15 basis points above market. And that is the hope. But I do think that in the next six months to nine months when interest rates do rise, that cap rates will follow suit. This is a phenomenon that we have seen played out in the past, and there is no expectation that it's not going to play out, but we don't see that currently.  In terms of what are we underwriting for the rest of the year? Our hope is that it is slightly above where we ended up last year, but we can't guarantee that. Our pipeline is incredibly robust with, again, opportunities that we love. And like I said, at least in the current market, we are not seeing cap rates move.  The one point I will add, and I think I covered that in my prepared remarks is the fact that we have inherited a team that was very used to focusing on the higher yielding side of the market. And that's part of our business. And that particular team has already started to produce results, above and beyond what we were being able to do pre-merger. And so could we see that help us on being able to achieve slightly higher cap rates? Potentially, but it's still too early to tell. But that is a team that is -- has hit the ground running and is performing as we had expected, and it's great to have them as part of the broader team.\nOperator: The next question is from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank.\nGreg McGinniss: You're going to hear Encore a bit more here. Hope you don't mind. Just curious how you went about getting expertise on the gaming space that was necessary for underwriting this new vertical? And then who from the team is getting licensed to allow for the acquisition in Massachusetts?\nSumit Roy: Greg, like a lot of things. We are so blessed to have a set of colleagues who are capable of understanding a new industry, are capable of underwriting the risk associated with that particular industry. And the fact that a lot of us have come from previous backgrounds that lends itself to a much wider realm of industry focus than what we were doing here at Realty Income also allows us greater confidence.  The fact that we partnered with Wynn and to work with Craig and his team, that tool allowed us to continue to refine our thesis around the risks associated with this business. And we are very comfortable that we have underwritten this particular opportunity appropriately. And we have leaned on experts where needed and also obviously leaned a lot on our own research department that continues to be the best-in-class in my opinion, across the street.  And that's how we got very comfortable with this new vertical that we are pursuing and more specifically with the operator that we have partnered with over the long term.  In terms of your second question with regards to who's going to go through the licensing process? Too early to tell. I know Michelle, our General Counsel and Chief Legal Officer, is working very closely with the MCG and is trying to figure the answers to those questions. But I don't have a precise answer on that for you yet.\nGreg McGinniss: Okay. And then Craig Billings mentioned that in terms of the deal only achievable due to the unique way the Realty being structured, are you able to further elaborate on that comment? And then also, why are you comfortable not requiring the CapEx minimum where the gaming REITs do typically require one?\nSumit Roy: Yes. Again, this was very important to Craig and his team. The fact that we were able to create a bespoke lease that works for them and works for us was very important to both partners. And for us, we are not in the habit of going out there and essentially copying leases that our precedents within this space. We approach this as a relationship, and we try to address what their pressure points were. We try to understand what causes those pressure points. And therefore, came up with a very bespoke lease that works for our partner at Wynn and works for us.  With respect to minimum capital requirements, et cetera, we feel like the entire brand of Wynn is associated with their investments in their properties. And you don't have to take my words for it. You just -- you can go and actually visit the property and see for yourself what I mean when I say that. And the fact that we don't have that specifically outlined in the lease is one that we were very comfortable with. Plus there are other protections that supported to us through the gaming licenses that you get in the Massachusetts. And so we feel like looking at it holistically, we are very well protected. Partnering with somebody like Wynn who invests in their properties above and beyond what most other operators do plus certain other provisions that we could lean on I think, gave us the comfort and allowed us to partner with them because that was a pressure point for them. So we are very, very comfortable with where we ended up. And we were glad we could do it and structure it so that Craig and his team were very comfortable moving forward.\nOperator: The next question is from Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs.\nCaitlin Burrows: Maybe moving to a different topic. Sumit, you mentioned earlier that lower-cost European debt helps to support investment activity in Europe. However, taxes do seem to be another piece to consider. So just wondering if you could give an update on how you consider the tax impact on your decision to acquire in the U.S. versus abroad?\nSumit Roy: Yes, Caitlin. That is certainly a cost of doing business in Europe and one that we take into account when we are underwriting assets and looking at long-term return profiles of opportunities that we ultimately end up pursuing.  And one of the ways we try to protect ourselves is by essentially match funding with local denominated currency these acquisitions, which is why if you look at it, the international portfolio on a stand-alone basis, you will find that we have raised a lot more debt to finance that business while not compromising obviously, on a fully consolidated basis, the overall leverage profile of our business. And the interest expense associated with that debt is a natural hedge and a natural protection to minimize the effective tax rate that we end up paying. So that's a very important point in our capital strategy of how we want to continue to grow our European business.  Having said that, it is true that the cost of debt in Europe, even in this increasing rate environment, continues to be less than what we can achieve here in the U.S. Today, I would say, if you were to look at a 10-year unsecured, it's probably in the 3.1%, 3.2% ZIP code for us. Whereas we can probably get 2.8%, 2.7-ish percent in the U.K. and 1.9%, potentially even slightly less in Mainland Europe in terms of 10-year unsecured bond. So that's what I meant when I said that our cost of capital is very portable and the advantages that accrue to us due to this cost of capital and our ratings essentially, gets inflated when we are able to take advantage of markets such as Mainland Europe and the U.K. So that's the strategy, and that's what we feel most comfortable with.\nCaitlin Burrows: Got it. Okay. And then maybe on the tenant side, you guys ended the fourth quarter with occupancy at 98.5% guidance is for about 98% this year. So I realize that's a potential small shift, but we do hear how healthy tenants are these days. So wondering if there's something in particular that you're expecting or if it's more of a general buffer, which then could you just comment on the watch list maybe more broadly?\nSumit Roy: Yes. That's a good question, Caitlin. And it's the last statement that you made, which is how we think about occupancy. We say it's roughly around 98%. Keep in mind, we've also just inherited 3,000 assets through the merger that we have digested and we feel very comfortable saying that it's right around 98%.  If you look at where we were last year, you look at the year before that, that tends to be the guidance that we gave to the market. Look, we could flex that number. We could try to have a higher occupancy number, if that was a target for us. But what we are trying to balance Caitlin, and I'm just sharing a little bit about how we think about our business, is trying to optimize the economic outcome on each one of these assets that is coming through to us. And we try to figure out whether it makes sense to sell it and maximize our total return profile, even vacant or invest capital and try to capture the rents and create a profile that is superior to selling it vacant or completely repositioned that asset. And all of those elements are on the table, and we go through and we try to figure out what is the best outcome. And the reason why we say 98% is because there will be a few assets that we want to hold on to and reposition and/or take the time to find the right tenant so that we maximize the total return profile. And that does sort of put downward pressure on our occupancy number. So when we talk about approximately 98%, it's to give us the flexibility to do what we want to do on the asset management side.  And you probably have tracked this, you can see that we have, more often they've not beaten that. So it really is more a mindset rather than a very precise point that we are trying to strike with regards to occupancy is to give us this flexibility that we need to maximize economic outcome.\nOperator: The next question is from Spenser Allaway with Green Street.\nSpenser Allaway: Given the strength of tenant credit within gaming, you mentioned the coverage levels, the attractive lease terms. As you consider additional gaming deals, does your view on tenant concentration change? Or said differently, how high would you allow any one gaming tenant to go given you could argue it is a superior credit relative to some other traditional retail tenants?\nSumit Roy: That's a great question, Spenser. Look, we obviously have certain speed bumps that's part of our investment policy that imposes certain restrictions on tenant concentration as well as industry concentration. Just so you have it, with regards to client concentration, it's 5%. And with regards to industry concentration, it's 15% as per our investment policy. So you have those speed bumps, if you will, to sort of make sure that we continue to be a very diversified portfolio. Having said that, we just executed on a -- well, it's not closed yet, but we've announced a $1.7 billion transaction. And yet, it's going to represent less than 3.5% of our overall client concentration. So we clearly have more room here, both on the industry side as well as on the specific client side to grow this business. We haven't entered into the gaming industry to basically say this is one transaction and we are done. This does become a new avenue of growth.  However, we will continue to remain very selective in terms of how we decide to grow this particular area. But those are the metrics that you can look to sort of to help us through the concentrating, both on the industry side as well as on the client side. But we certainly would like to grow this business. And for the right opportunity, we are more than willing to compromise some of these limits that we have in our investment policy. Of course, it will require Board approval, but we've done that in the past.  If you recall, Walgreens used to be north of 5% at one point. So was 7-Eleven. And post the merger, both of them have dropped below 5% today. But for the right clients and the right opportunity, we are more than happy to make compromises on those limits.\nSpenser Allaway: Okay. That actually answered all my follow-up questions. And but -- so maybe one more. As you continue to identify new lanes of external growth, just curious if you've explored the possibility of expanding into ground leases similar to what we've seen ABC do?\nSumit Roy: Yes, Spenser, I think this is a question that's been asked before. I want to say about 2.5% of our revenues come from ground leases. But let me tell you that when you go into this market today and a particular opportunity is being marketed as a ground lease, i.e., there's a building, but you don't really own the building. If you look at the pricing, the expectation of the seller is that you're paying for both the building as well as the ground because the building is going to come with the ground at the expiration of the lease term. And so yes, it's -- you can claim that this is a ground lease that you are purchasing, but the actual proceeds being paid for those opportunities, are essentially a fee simple opportunities. So we don't talk about the fact that a certain portion of our rent concentration comes from ground leases, primarily because we recognize that more often than not, we are paying for the building as well. And so yes, I'd love to be able to start talking about ground leases that we have, but the cost base is on those ground leases, you recognize to be fee simple transactions.\nOperator: The next question is from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley.\nRonald Kamdem: Just a quick question. Following up on sort of the sale-leaseback opportunities. Just want to get a sense of sort of post the merger closing. Just what resources has been allocated in terms of personnel or structure to going after these sort of opportunities and so forth?\nSumit Roy: Well, if you track our personnel count, and I think Shannon started posting those, but I don't know. You will see that we have grown our team quite a bit. And some of that has sort of translated into a more normalized G&A number. And if you look at where we ended up in 2021, it's at 371 people. If you compare that to where we were at the end of 2020, it was closer to 230-odd folks. And so the team has grown. Part of it obviously came through the VEREIT merger, but also organically in order to continue to pursue and expand the avenues of growth, we have rightsized the team both on the research side, on the acquisition side, on the asset management side, on the property management side, et cetera, et cetera.  And so I think this is a reflection of a business that is continuing to grow and not only grow in its traditional routes, but also continue to increase new avenues of growth. And so that is going to translate into a broader personnel base as can be seen by these numbers.\nRonald Kamdem: Great. And then my second question is just on your thinking about sort of external growth opportunities. You've talked about sort of looking at higher-yielding structures and so forth. Just curious how much thought goes into potentially looking at higher escalator structures similar to sort of the transaction that went through?\nSumit Roy: A lot is the short answer. If you look at our straight-line cap rate for 2021, the headline number was I think 5 4 for the fourth quarter, but there's 80 basis points of straight line. So it's really a 6.2% straight-line cap rate for the fourth quarter. And so you can imagine the only way to generate 80 basis points of straight-line rent on an annual basis is through these higher growth rates embedded in the leases. And so that is a conscious effort on the part of Mark and Neil's teams who continue to generate that inherent growth profile that we have traditionally and make that a much higher number going forward.  And so part of how we think about looking at new opportunities, new verticals, is to see the profile of the existing leases that are percolating in the market within those spaces. And that is certainly an element that we take into consideration before deciding to pursue routes.\nOperator: The next question is from Katy McConnell with Citigroup.\nMary McConnell: Just wanted to follow up on an earlier question on taxes. I'm just wondering what the higher tax expense guidance for the year is factoring in, in terms of your targeted U.S. versus international acquisition mix for this year?\nSumit Roy: Christie, do you want to take that?\nChristie Kelly: Sure. Thanks, Sumit. Thanks, Katy. Yes, the higher taxes are incorporating our international growth, Katy, which is very similar to what we experienced this year as well, as Neil and the team are making some great progress.\nMary McConnell: So just in terms of a targeted mix for U.S. versus international, what should we be thinking about this year relative to last?\nChristie Kelly: I think that international, you could be looking at 35%, 65%, 60-40 U.S. international.\nMary McConnell: Great. That's helpful. And then just regarding the acquisition pipeline, are there any other new investment categories that you're still actively exploring outside of gaming that you can speak to or update us on? Where you're finding similarly attractive investment or opportunities today?\nSumit Roy: Yes, Katy, I won't go through the areas that we are internally discussing, exploring, underwriting, because that becomes an exercise in futility, right? We talk about certain avenues and they don't materialize, and then it becomes a constant question in every subsequent call as to when we are going to go into it. We'd much rather consummate a transaction, get it over the finish line and then discuss our rationale as to why we chose to go down the path of entering into that new area. But suffice to say, Katy, we are exploring multiple avenues of growth. And some of the discussions that we've had on this call should give you an insight into what is driving our thought process around new avenues that we would like to consider going forward. But I just don't want to engage in a conversation right now, Katy, with respect to going into too much details on what those are because some may never materialize. And so just bear with us, and I want to be very clear, there are new areas that we are constantly looking at. And if and when we are able to get something over the finish line, we will absolutely talk to you, and you can grill us on the details as to the why we chose to pursue those routes.\nOperator: The next question is from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America.\nJoshua Dennerlein: A question on what percent of your ABR is on cash accounting basis? And then could you provide some color on the rent repay that you got in 4Q on the previously uncollected amounts?\nSumit Roy: Christie, you want to take that?\nChristie Kelly: Sure. Yes, of course. So essentially, when we're taking a look at the overall deferred rents and impact of -- essentially, collections have been exceedingly strong. The total deferral amount is about $140 million, $150 million as of 12/31/21 at the end of the year. And we're achieving a very strong collections in that regard. As we also noted in the fourth quarter all of our theater clients are current. And so great progress.  And then in terms of what you would have seen in the fourth quarter, because of those strong theater collections, we actually recorded total bad debt expense of less than $1 million and less than $15 million for the entire year because of the fact that we had those strong collections.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. And sorry, did I miss what percent of your ABR is on cash accounting basis or...\nChristie Kelly: We have overall cash accounting basis on ABR, modest I want to say. Yes, it's less than 2%.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. Perfect. And then sorry if I missed this in the opening remarks, but the Encore acquisition, it came with an expansion opportunity. Could you maybe walk us through this opportunity and the additional economics it would offer?\nSumit Roy: Sure, Joshua. So there is a parking lot that is across the street from where the main building is located. Today, if you talk to Craig and his team, they're actually having to pass on some of the patrons given the lack of parking space that is required to accommodate this increase in traffic. So the goal is for them to develop a multistoried aboveground, potentially even below ground parking that is going to not just be a parking lot, but also it's going to have an entertainment venue of up to 1,000 seats, maybe it's 999 seats. Plus a few other entertainment areas right in that -- in the same building that is going to get constructed across the street. And it's going to have an enclosed tunnel, aboveground tunnel pathway that leads right into the casino into the Encore Boston Harbor building from this building. And so the expectation is that this is going to get built over the next couple of years and will actually add to the overall performance of the building.  And clearly, this is a very symbiotic relationship between this parking lot, this enclosed pathway that's going to connect the 2 buildings. And so we -- they have the ability -- once constructed, and there's a 6-year time frame within which they have to do this, which gives them plenty of time to be able to consummate their current plans. We will buy this building at a 7% yield. And obviously, this should translate into even better coverages than we currently have at the particular building. But that is the option that you're referencing that's there in the lease. Josh, did that answer your question? Josh, I think, you're muted.\nOperator: His line is now closed. And the next question is from John Massocca with Ladenburg Thalmann.\nJohn Massocca: First, just a quick kind of detailed question. Was the Wynn transaction kind of contemplated in your prior guidance? I just think, obviously, the per share results won't be heavily impacted given the expected timing, but it was just notable that there wasn't really a change in acquisition outlook.\nSumit Roy: John, I think you've been covering us for many, many years, and you probably have a very good understanding of when we talk about acquisitions, when we talk about guidance, it really does not have the underlying opportunities perfectly laid out because we don't have that visibility. There's a confidence level, there's a feel for the market. There's a feel for the opportunities that we are seeing. And that is the reason why based on the earnings guidance that came out, the underlying acquisitions guidance was above $5 billion. We don't know what the makeup or the composition of $5 billion worth of transactions are going to look like, some of which could be assets like the gaming asset that we just announced. But that's a very big asset.  So we feel now even more confident that above $5 billion is very much an achievable number, assuming that we are able to close on this transaction by the fourth quarter. But it is very difficult to say, oh, you should completely exclude this number from the $5 billion or it was inclusive of the entire $1.7 billion, just given the sheer size of this. But what it does allow us to do is stand in front of you today and say with a high level of confidence -- a higher level of confidence that achieving a north of $5 billion number for this year is, in fact, something that we feel very good about. So that's how I would answer that question.\nJohn Massocca: Okay. Understood. And then maybe thinking bigger picture, you've obviously been in the net lease space for a long period of time. As you look back to other periods of times where you've been in a rising interest rate environment, and you compare it to the kind of current environment we're in, what do you think are kind of the factors, if you will, that will drive cap rates to be more reflective of kind of rising rates?  And I guess maybe as you look at kind of the competitive set that you compete with for these net lease investments, how kind of interest rate sensitive maybe are they today versus kind of the competitive set in other periods of time kind of similar to the one we're in today?\nSumit Roy: Yes. That's a very good question, John. I can tell you that based on our own internal analysis, we have obviously seen the cycle before. Rising interest rate environments, what happens to cap rates then. And what we found is that there is a positive correlation between rising interest rate environments and cap rates, but there tends to be a bit of a lag now. Is it 6 months, 9 months, 12 months? It's somewhere in that ZIP code, but there is. And if you think about it fundamentally, obviously, if cap rates are rising, especially in the private markets that leans on the debt environment a lot more, the cost of that debt is going up.  And so at some point, there's a mismatch between existing cap rates and the cost of financing that particular opportunity. And so those do tend to sort of balance out and reach an equilibrium point. That's what we've seen in years past.  There is one difference in today's environment, and that is that net lease as a product has become much, much more institutional. And we have seen a plethora of capital coming into our space on the private equity side, on the sovereign wealth side and, of course, with the preponderance of public net lease companies that have recently come into the floor.  So I think that wall of capital that is now interested in net lease is going to potentially put a curve on how quickly we get to this equilibrium point going forward. And I think in this sort of environment, once again, the fact that we are an A-, A3-rated company. And yes, our cost of debt will certainly go up and has gone up. But it will tend to go up less than a lot of our competitors who are perhaps not as rated as highly. And also in the private markets, the folks that lean on leverage a lot more and therefore, there -- the impact to their cost of capital will be much higher than the impact to ours, I think is an advantage that should allow us to continue to do transactions that others might have to step away from. So even though I believe in today's environment, that the equilibrium point might take a little bit longer to achieve. I believe that some of the advantages that Realty Income as a platform is able to sort of embrace. I do think that, that will play out more in our favor and will allow us to do things that others might not be able to get to as quickly.\nOperator: The next question is from Linda Tsai with Jefferies.\nLinda Tsai: I believe the later 4Q closing of the Wynn transaction is typical for the industry, given regulatory considerations, but what are your general thoughts around buying high-value assets or portfolios that close at a later date to create more visibility in terms of funding and hitting investment targets, do you see advantages to this approach?\nSumit Roy: Yes. Linda, that's a very good question. And I think I've received questions around, \"Hey, this is a very large transaction, it's $1.7 billion. How are you going to finance it?\" For us, yes, it's a single transaction, but that the size of that transaction is -- it's not unprecedented. We just did $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter of last year. And -- just in that quarter, and we're able to match fund our acquisitions by raising our equity, $1.7 billion of equity in the fourth quarter through the ATM.  And obviously, we did some more debt on the unsecured side post the fourth quarter. So for us, I think, again, one of the big advantages that we have is the liquidity that our stock affords us. We are trading close to $200 million in stock on a daily basis and are able to very easily raise capital to match fund, what might seem nominally as being a very large number, we are able to match fund it without this overhang situation. So we -- if it closes in the third quarter or whether it closes in the fourth quarter, it doesn't really matter to us because we'll have a much better feel for it internally.  And we'll be able to match fund accordingly. So yes, it's a big number on a single asset, but I don't think we see this as necessarily causing any overhang or should not cause any overhang issues for us.\nLinda Tsai: And then in terms of vacated boxes, you talked about weighing the decision between selling and maybe putting some capital back in to maximize value. Could you give us some examples of how you've repositioned boxes in the past and maybe what type might be more amenable to the strategy currently?\nSumit Roy: Yes, Linda, that is very much a function of the type of box that we are talking about, a convenience store could be converted into a car wash or could remain a convenience store. A 10,000 square foot box could be turned into a 2 or 3-tenant box that actually generates 150%, 160% of expiring rents.  We've had examples of Pizza Hut that have been converted into Starbucks in multiple places. And there are a lot of coffee chains that are aggressively growing their portfolio and are more than willing to pay for repositioning of either previous QSRs or Pizza Hut et cetera given the location, et cetera, and are more than willing to pay us rents that are in excess of what the expiring rents were in their previous life. So those are some of the repositionings that we have accomplished to date and what we hope to be able to do because these can be quite positive from a rent per square foot perspective is to grow that part of our business going forward, and that is the goal. But yes, so far, so good.\nOperator: The next question is from Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities.\nChristopher Lucas: Just a quick question on the balance sheet, if I may. And Sumit, thank you for the sort of current pricing on 10-year debt that you see out there. I guess just curious as to what the capacity you think you have today is for additional sterling-denominated and/or euro-denominated bonds given the portfolio at this point?\nSumit Roy: Christie, do you want to?\nChristie Kelly: Yes -- sure, Sumit. Yes, Chris, I think from that perspective, we've got plenty of runway for 2022 in order to be able to execute in alignment with our capital strategy. And further to this, realize it wasn't part of your question, but we're also looking forward to executing on the euro market, too.\nChristopher Lucas: Okay. I guess the point of the question really gets to -- you've got a number of bonds. They're not near term, but they're sort of intermediate terms that are coming due at above market relative to sort of what you think you could do today. Just curious as to how you think about how aggressive you'll be in terms of looking to essentially refinance that debt?\nChristie Kelly: Yes. And I think Chris that's -- for example, in 2022, we have a very modest debt maturities. And in terms of what we articulated as it relates to the VEREIT transaction, we're very focused on that here in the coming years, and we will be aggressive in that regard.\nSumit Roy: The only other thing I'll add, Chris, is we've done liability management throughout the years. Even last year, we went ahead and we paid the 2023s and the '24s out. So this is something that we will continue to monitor. And if it makes sense, we are more than happy to prepay our unsecured bonds and take advantage of interest rate environments that we find ourselves in. So I just wanted to leave you with that, but that is certainly a tool available to us, and we will avail of it at the appropriate times.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income's conference call. I'll now turn the call over to Sumit Roy for concluding remarks.\nSumit Roy: Thanks, Chris. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with many of you soon at the upcoming investor conferences. Take care. Bye-bye.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Sumit. We continue to prioritize a conservative balance sheet structure while procuring attractively priced capital. During the quarter, our capital markets activity was highlighted by the issuance of over $1.7 billion of equity, primarily through our ATM program, which enabled us to simultaneously complete the VEREIT merger and finance a record quarter for acquisitions while finishing the year within our targeted leverage parameters. As we emphasized when we announced the merger in April, we intended to close the transaction in a leverage-neutral manner relative to our target leverage level, which we are pleased to have accomplished. One of the benefits of our enhanced size and scale is daily trading liquidity in our stock that provides us with the ability to issue significant amounts of equity through the ATM in a cost-efficient manner without disrupting the market price of our stock.  As a result, we entered 2022 from a position of strength with a net debt to annualized pro forma adjusted EBITDAR of 5.3x. Subsequent to year-end, we issued $500 million in sterling-denominated senior unsecured notes, pricing 5-year and 20-year notes at a blended all-in yield of 2.28%, with a weighted average term of 12.5 years.  This was the third sterling-denominated debt offering we have priced in the last 16 months, and we could not be more appreciative of the support we have received from the Sterling fixed income investor base.  Moving on to the financial results for the quarter. In fourth quarter, our business generated $0.94 of AFFO per share, supported by our healthy portfolio, closing of the VEREIT merger, strong acquisition pace and collection of almost 100% of contractual rent during the fourth quarter. Going forward, we will no longer be providing COVID-19 disclosures as we believe portfolio operating performance has returned to pre-pandemic levels in terms of overall collection. In 2021, our business generated $3.59 of AFFO per share, finishing near the high end of guidance and representing 5.9% annual growth. Given the health of our portfolio and our active global investment pipeline, we remain comfortable with our previously announced 2022 AFFO per share guidance of $3.84 to $3.97, representing 8.8% annual growth at the midpoint.  Realty Income was founded on the principles of income generation and capital preservation. We remain committed to delivering monthly dividends that increase over time as part of a consistently attractive total shareholder return proposition. In December, we were pleased to have increased our dividend by 5.1% as compared to the same period last year. The increase in the dividend was intended to share with our shareholders, the accretion from the recently closed VEREIT merger, together with continued earnings accretion that we were able to generate throughout the year from our business.  We have now increased the dividend 114x since our 1994 listing and remain proud to be 1 of only 3 REITs in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index for having raised our dividend for at least 25 consecutive years.  Now I would like to hand the call back to Sumit. Sure. Thanks, Sumit. Thanks, Katy. Yes, the higher taxes are incorporating our international growth, Katy, which is very similar to what we experienced this year as well, as Neil and the team are making some great progress. I think that international, you could be looking at 35%, 65%, 60-40 U.S. international. Sure. Yes, of course. So essentially, when we're taking a look at the overall deferred rents and impact of -- essentially, collections have been exceedingly strong. The total deferral amount is about $140 million, $150 million as of 12/31/21 at the end of the year. And we're achieving a very strong collections in that regard. As we also noted in the fourth quarter all of our theater clients are current. And so great progress.  And then in terms of what you would have seen in the fourth quarter, because of those strong theater collections, we actually recorded total bad debt expense of less than $1 million and less than $15 million for the entire year because of the fact that we had those strong collections. We have overall cash accounting basis on ABR, modest I want to say. Yes, it's less than 2%. Yes -- sure, Sumit. Yes, Chris, I think from that perspective, we've got plenty of runway for 2022 in order to be able to execute in alignment with our capital strategy. And further to this, realize it wasn't part of your question, but we're also looking forward to executing on the euro market, too. Yes. And I think Chris that's -- for example, in 2022, we have a very modest debt maturities. And in terms of what we articulated as it relates to the VEREIT transaction, we're very focused on that here in the coming years, and we will be aggressive in that regard."

            "name": "Sumit Roy",
            "content": "Thanks, Julie. Welcome, everyone. As I reflect on the past year at Realty Income, I remain inspired by the dedication of our colleagues who continue to relentlessly pursue numerous profitable growth initiatives while contributing to a record year of acquisitions for our company.  During the fourth quarter, we closed on the merger with VEREIT, welcoming many talented new colleagues that will further help drive our ambitious goals while amplifying our competitive position in the industry. We are committed to a seamless and successful transition as we collectively work to integrate our one team, processes and systems. We remain on track to achieve over 75% of our annualized G&A cost synergies in year one post-merger, as we outlined upon announcing the merger in April of last year. Specifically, we have achieved over $42 million of our $37.5 million targeted synergies in year one, representing full year 2022, with over $50 million in G&A synergies expected in year two, representing full year 2023. Also, I continue to be impressed by the talent and dedication of our new team members as we work to integrate our two platforms and further strengthen our one team. And while we creatively bring together the best practices of VEREIT and Realty Income with our integration efforts to productively scale our operations, I'm encouraged by our integration work completed to date and our journey ahead.  Beyond the merger, our business set a quarterly record for investment volume in the fourth quarter. During the quarter, we strengthened our foothold in Spain through additional high-quality acquisitions, including our second acquisition of properties leased to a key partner in Carrefour, one of the world's leading grocery retailers.  Our strategic expansion into Continental Europe meaningfully increases our total addressable universe, as we estimate the total addressable market in Europe to be $8 trillion, nearly double that of the U.S. We expect our investment activity in Europe to continue contributing to our competitive cost of capital as we look to further hedge our currency risk with debt priced at meaningfully lower yields than in the U.S.  Looking forward, we are well positioned to continue creating value by capitalizing on our portable competitive advantages globally to deliver favorable risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. With regards to recent developments, as previously disclosed this month, we announced our intent to acquire the Encore Boston Harbor, the East Coast's leading integrated resort and casino located less than 5 miles from downtown Boston. The $1.7 billion acquisition is being consummated at a 5.9% cash cap rate with a 30-year initial lease term. The property represents our first investment in the gaming industry and would represent less than 3.5% of our pro forma annual rent. While the property type is new, the lens we use to pursue the merits of the transaction is not. Our investment strategy centers around partnership with best-in-class operators occupying high-quality real estate locations, which is particularly important when entering a new business vertical and geography. We followed this strategy with the Diageo sale leaseback in 2010 when executing our first transaction in the Vineyard space, with the Sainsbury's sale leaseback in 2019 when expanding our business internationally. And more recently, with the Carrefour sale leaseback when we entered into Spain last year.  Our debut transaction in the gaming industry with Wynn Resorts represents the same commitment to partnering with the premier leaders in the respective industries together with a commitment to our overall investment strategy. The Encore Boston Harbor acquisition will add further diversification to our industry and client roster. After closing this transaction, we expect Wynn Resorts will become one of our top 10 clients. Our capacity to pursue and absorb a transaction of this size with a single client was supported by the enhanced size and scale that we gained through the VEREIT merger. And it is a testament to our ability to complete large-scale transactions without significantly impacting our prudent portfolio diversification metrics.  The Encore Boston Harbor transaction meets our key investment criteria and illustrates that our investment opportunity set is not constrained by a particular property type. The merits of this transaction are first, the real estate. We're acquiring 3.1 million square feet of high-quality real estate strategically located on the banks of the Mystic River. After opening in 2019, the property is still ramping but already generates $210 million in annual EBITDAR, resulting in 2.1x rent coverage initially.  Second, the client lease. We are entering into a 30-year triple net lease with attractive annual rent escalators at 1.75% annually for the first 10 years and the greater of 1.75% or CPI thereafter capped at 2.5%. Wynn Resorts is one of the largest premier gaming operators in the U.S. with an enterprise value of approximately $20 billion. They maintain a healthy balance sheet, moderate leverage and significant liquidity. Third, the industry performance. The gaming industry in the U.S. has recovered to pre-COVID levels. And in Massachusetts, gaming revenues grew 17% in the fourth quarter of 2021 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, outperforming the aggregate regional gaming market that grew 8% during the same time frame. Pending regulatory procedures, we expect to close the transaction in the fourth quarter of 2022. Craig and his team have been a pleasure to work with, and we are pleased to cultivate this new relationship with Wynn Resorts as we expand our universe of net lease investments across many industries. Now turning to the results for the quarter. We are pleased with the continued strength of our core operations. We ended the quarter with our portfolio at 98.5% occupancy based on property count. Bolstered by the inherent quality of our real estate and enhanced by the proactive efforts of our talented and experienced asset management team, we re-leased 232 leases this quarter, recapturing 101.8% of expiring rent and bringing our full year 2021 recapture rate to 103.4%.  Since our public listing in 1994, we have executed over 4,100 re-leases or sales on expiring leases, recapturing over 100% of rent on those re-leased contracts. We continue to report our quarterly recapture rates and believe this is one of the most objective ways to measure underlying portfolio quality in the net lease industry and is a testament to the merit of our asset management team.  After closing the VEREIT merger, we look forward with an enhanced key competitive advantage of size and scale. With an enterprise value of more than $57 billion, our portfolio now includes over 11,100 properties leased to approximately 1,040 clients in the United States and Europe across a diversified set of 60 distinct industries.  Our total portfolio annualized contractual rent increased by over 50% since the end of the third quarter, ending the year at over $2.9 billion. With our expanded size and scale, we have greater client and industry diversification, which further improves our competitive positioning to pursue large portfolio or sale-leaseback transactions in the fragmented net lease industry and be a one-stop solution for multibillion-dollar opportunities. Since the end of the third quarter, our top 10 client concentration has decreased to 29.1% from 34.8%, and we believe it represents one of the highest quality portfolios in the net lease industry. Additionally, our top industry concentration has decreased, creating additional investment capacity. Our top 5 industries now comprise 40% of our annualized contractual rent compared to over 43% at the end of the third quarter and a top industry exposure, which includes convenience stores and grocery stores have declined meaningfully. With the growth in concentration of our targeted industries, theater and health and fitness industry concentrations have naturally declined. In terms of the casual dining contribution from our VEREIT merger, the majority of their concentration is with Red Lobster that has experienced improved operating performance is now owned by Thai Union an established strong financial sponsor.  Our international geographic concentration also declined pursuant to our VEREIT transaction, providing further room to achieve profitable growth in Europe and beyond. We have already started to see the benefits of our expanded platform through increased sourcing and acquisition volume. In 2021, we sourced approximately $84.5 billion of acquisition opportunities and approximately 39% was sourced from international markets. Reflecting our stringent investment criteria, we closed on approximately 8% of the total opportunities, bringing our total 2021 property level acquisitions to $6.4 billion, an annual record for our company. Of the $6.4 billion invested in 2021, over 40% or approximately $2.6 billion was invested during the fourth quarter. Over $1 billion of our volume in the fourth quarter was the result of international investments, bringing our total international portfolio to nearly $4.3 billion of invested capital at the end of the year. We believe the market is efficient, and we're experiencing a competitive environment for high-quality assets leased to strong operators. Accordingly, the quality of our acquisition is reflected in our average initial cash cap rate during the fourth quarter of 5.4% and 5.5% for the year.  The largest industries represented in our fourth quarter acquisition were European grocery stores and U.S. automotive services, which represent a continued investment in industries well positioned to perform in a variety of economic cycles, given its necessity-based retail proposition for consumers. The weighted average remaining lease term of assets added to our portfolio during the quarter was 14.2 years. We continue to generate healthy investment spreads of approximately 140 basis points during the quarter and 150 basis points during the year, consistent with our historical average, while acquiring, in our view, the highest quality product in the marketplace.  Inflation has been an important topic to investors in the last few months. I want to emphasize that we believe our business is, by design, well positioned to drive shareholder value in this climate.  From a balance sheet perspective, having a well-staggered fixed-rate debt maturity schedule with no corporate bond maturities until 2024, limits our debt refinancing risk in a potentially rising rate environment. And we believe we actually benefit from an inflationary environment given our lease expiration schedule and our proven ability to recapture more than the value of expiring rent upon re-leasing.  Finally, the value of our business is largely tied to current income as a recurring cash flow vehicle, which makes the value proposition of owning realty income comparatively more attractive during inflationary periods, as compared to other sectors in the marketplace whose value is high to growth in future years.  At this time, I'll pass it over to Christie, who will further discuss results from the quarter. Thank you, Christie. We remain humbled by our collective accomplishments in 2021, including the completion of the merger, but also with the strength of our full year results and our attention now turns to the path forward.  Realty Income has a bright outlook for 2022 and beyond, and we look forward to continuing to build a strong and resilient platform as we embrace the opportunities that lie ahead. As we enter a new year of possibilities, we remain steadfast in our purpose of building enduring relationships and brighter financial futures, while relentlessly pursuing ways to provide shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns over the long run.  At this time, I'd like to open it up for any questions. Yes. The short answer, Brad, is yes, we do. For us, our thesis is quite simple. We want to try to partner with the best-in-class operators and get the premier assets that they operate. If you look at the Boston Harbor asset, it is the premier superregional asset in the United States. If you look at the coverage, and this is an asset that is still not fully stabilized, it's at 2.1x. If you think about Wynn, they are an S&P 500 company that is arguably the best operator in the space. If you look at regional gaming and compare it to the volatility associated with the strip, it tends to be a lot less volatile. And more specifically, if you look at the Massachusetts market, which has grown at almost 18% in the fourth quarter of 2021. Even compared to the national average on the gaming side, it was almost 2x that.  If you look at the actual asset itself and you see what we've paid for the asset and compare it to what was actually invested in the asset, and these are all public numbers, you'll start to get very comfortable with the fact that we feel very comfortable about what we've paid in terms of replacement cost.  And we've been very open with the market with respect to our desire to continue to explore new avenues of growth and this is one that completely fits that profile of trying to partner with the best-in-class operators and trying to add best-in-class real estate to our portfolio.  If you look at the lease structure, it's a 30-year lease with growth that is in excess of what we are able to generate on the rest of the portfolio. And those are the reasons why we felt this was the right opportunity for us to sort of enter into the gaming space, with the right operator as a partner and with the right asset. Look, we did our first transaction in this particular space. So we are very hopeful that we can continue to grow this area. And as long as we feel like we can structure transactions for the right properties with the right operators, we are very happy to grow this area of our business. We've been very open with the market about playing across the risk spectrum with regards to yield, and yield for us is a proxy for the risk associated with it.  And if we feel like on a risk-adjusted basis, we're able to grow our portfolio even within gaming, we'll be very happy to do so. We continue to talk about how important partnerships are for us and Wynn is that. It's a long-term partner. And in the event they decide that they would like to pursue other transactions, we would like to be there for them and continue to grow our exposure to gaming and in particular, our exposure to Wynn. I'm not going to answer your second question. But the first one, there was no process. This is -- like we said, we emphasize relationship above all else. And we wanted to partner with Wynn. And this came about through a conversation that started towards the end of last year. And so there were no rounds. There were no other folks. It was purely a relationship-driven transaction. Yes. That's a very interesting question, Nate. We continue to see a very aggressive cap rate market, especially for the type of products that we are pursuing. We would have thought that given the fact that we've been in this -- expectation of higher inflation, higher interest rate environment that would start to sort of percolate into the rest of the acquisitions market, we haven't seen that yet.  Now history would suggest that cap rates do tend to adjust, especially if some of these increases become more than just an expectation. But at least the current market situation is one where we are not seeing even a stabilization of the cap rate, we continue to see downward pressure.  And this is where being able to partner and lean on relationships, et cetera, is going to allow us to potentially get that 5, 10, 15 basis points above market. And that is the hope. But I do think that in the next six months to nine months when interest rates do rise, that cap rates will follow suit. This is a phenomenon that we have seen played out in the past, and there is no expectation that it's not going to play out, but we don't see that currently.  In terms of what are we underwriting for the rest of the year? Our hope is that it is slightly above where we ended up last year, but we can't guarantee that. Our pipeline is incredibly robust with, again, opportunities that we love. And like I said, at least in the current market, we are not seeing cap rates move.  The one point I will add, and I think I covered that in my prepared remarks is the fact that we have inherited a team that was very used to focusing on the higher yielding side of the market. And that's part of our business. And that particular team has already started to produce results, above and beyond what we were being able to do pre-merger. And so could we see that help us on being able to achieve slightly higher cap rates? Potentially, but it's still too early to tell. But that is a team that is -- has hit the ground running and is performing as we had expected, and it's great to have them as part of the broader team. Greg, like a lot of things. We are so blessed to have a set of colleagues who are capable of understanding a new industry, are capable of underwriting the risk associated with that particular industry. And the fact that a lot of us have come from previous backgrounds that lends itself to a much wider realm of industry focus than what we were doing here at Realty Income also allows us greater confidence.  The fact that we partnered with Wynn and to work with Craig and his team, that tool allowed us to continue to refine our thesis around the risks associated with this business. And we are very comfortable that we have underwritten this particular opportunity appropriately. And we have leaned on experts where needed and also obviously leaned a lot on our own research department that continues to be the best-in-class in my opinion, across the street.  And that's how we got very comfortable with this new vertical that we are pursuing and more specifically with the operator that we have partnered with over the long term.  In terms of your second question with regards to who's going to go through the licensing process? Too early to tell. I know Michelle, our General Counsel and Chief Legal Officer, is working very closely with the MCG and is trying to figure the answers to those questions. But I don't have a precise answer on that for you yet. Yes. Again, this was very important to Craig and his team. The fact that we were able to create a bespoke lease that works for them and works for us was very important to both partners. And for us, we are not in the habit of going out there and essentially copying leases that our precedents within this space. We approach this as a relationship, and we try to address what their pressure points were. We try to understand what causes those pressure points. And therefore, came up with a very bespoke lease that works for our partner at Wynn and works for us.  With respect to minimum capital requirements, et cetera, we feel like the entire brand of Wynn is associated with their investments in their properties. And you don't have to take my words for it. You just -- you can go and actually visit the property and see for yourself what I mean when I say that. And the fact that we don't have that specifically outlined in the lease is one that we were very comfortable with. Plus there are other protections that supported to us through the gaming licenses that you get in the Massachusetts. And so we feel like looking at it holistically, we are very well protected. Partnering with somebody like Wynn who invests in their properties above and beyond what most other operators do plus certain other provisions that we could lean on I think, gave us the comfort and allowed us to partner with them because that was a pressure point for them. So we are very, very comfortable with where we ended up. And we were glad we could do it and structure it so that Craig and his team were very comfortable moving forward. Yes, Caitlin. That is certainly a cost of doing business in Europe and one that we take into account when we are underwriting assets and looking at long-term return profiles of opportunities that we ultimately end up pursuing.  And one of the ways we try to protect ourselves is by essentially match funding with local denominated currency these acquisitions, which is why if you look at it, the international portfolio on a stand-alone basis, you will find that we have raised a lot more debt to finance that business while not compromising obviously, on a fully consolidated basis, the overall leverage profile of our business. And the interest expense associated with that debt is a natural hedge and a natural protection to minimize the effective tax rate that we end up paying. So that's a very important point in our capital strategy of how we want to continue to grow our European business.  Having said that, it is true that the cost of debt in Europe, even in this increasing rate environment, continues to be less than what we can achieve here in the U.S. Today, I would say, if you were to look at a 10-year unsecured, it's probably in the 3.1%, 3.2% ZIP code for us. Whereas we can probably get 2.8%, 2.7-ish percent in the U.K. and 1.9%, potentially even slightly less in Mainland Europe in terms of 10-year unsecured bond. So that's what I meant when I said that our cost of capital is very portable and the advantages that accrue to us due to this cost of capital and our ratings essentially, gets inflated when we are able to take advantage of markets such as Mainland Europe and the U.K. So that's the strategy, and that's what we feel most comfortable with. Yes. That's a good question, Caitlin. And it's the last statement that you made, which is how we think about occupancy. We say it's roughly around 98%. Keep in mind, we've also just inherited 3,000 assets through the merger that we have digested and we feel very comfortable saying that it's right around 98%.  If you look at where we were last year, you look at the year before that, that tends to be the guidance that we gave to the market. Look, we could flex that number. We could try to have a higher occupancy number, if that was a target for us. But what we are trying to balance Caitlin, and I'm just sharing a little bit about how we think about our business, is trying to optimize the economic outcome on each one of these assets that is coming through to us. And we try to figure out whether it makes sense to sell it and maximize our total return profile, even vacant or invest capital and try to capture the rents and create a profile that is superior to selling it vacant or completely repositioned that asset. And all of those elements are on the table, and we go through and we try to figure out what is the best outcome. And the reason why we say 98% is because there will be a few assets that we want to hold on to and reposition and/or take the time to find the right tenant so that we maximize the total return profile. And that does sort of put downward pressure on our occupancy number. So when we talk about approximately 98%, it's to give us the flexibility to do what we want to do on the asset management side.  And you probably have tracked this, you can see that we have, more often they've not beaten that. So it really is more a mindset rather than a very precise point that we are trying to strike with regards to occupancy is to give us this flexibility that we need to maximize economic outcome. That's a great question, Spenser. Look, we obviously have certain speed bumps that's part of our investment policy that imposes certain restrictions on tenant concentration as well as industry concentration. Just so you have it, with regards to client concentration, it's 5%. And with regards to industry concentration, it's 15% as per our investment policy. So you have those speed bumps, if you will, to sort of make sure that we continue to be a very diversified portfolio. Having said that, we just executed on a -- well, it's not closed yet, but we've announced a $1.7 billion transaction. And yet, it's going to represent less than 3.5% of our overall client concentration. So we clearly have more room here, both on the industry side as well as on the specific client side to grow this business. We haven't entered into the gaming industry to basically say this is one transaction and we are done. This does become a new avenue of growth.  However, we will continue to remain very selective in terms of how we decide to grow this particular area. But those are the metrics that you can look to sort of to help us through the concentrating, both on the industry side as well as on the client side. But we certainly would like to grow this business. And for the right opportunity, we are more than willing to compromise some of these limits that we have in our investment policy. Of course, it will require Board approval, but we've done that in the past.  If you recall, Walgreens used to be north of 5% at one point. So was 7-Eleven. And post the merger, both of them have dropped below 5% today. But for the right clients and the right opportunity, we are more than happy to make compromises on those limits. Yes, Spenser, I think this is a question that's been asked before. I want to say about 2.5% of our revenues come from ground leases. But let me tell you that when you go into this market today and a particular opportunity is being marketed as a ground lease, i.e., there's a building, but you don't really own the building. If you look at the pricing, the expectation of the seller is that you're paying for both the building as well as the ground because the building is going to come with the ground at the expiration of the lease term. And so yes, it's -- you can claim that this is a ground lease that you are purchasing, but the actual proceeds being paid for those opportunities, are essentially a fee simple opportunities. So we don't talk about the fact that a certain portion of our rent concentration comes from ground leases, primarily because we recognize that more often than not, we are paying for the building as well. And so yes, I'd love to be able to start talking about ground leases that we have, but the cost base is on those ground leases, you recognize to be fee simple transactions. Well, if you track our personnel count, and I think Shannon started posting those, but I don't know. You will see that we have grown our team quite a bit. And some of that has sort of translated into a more normalized G&A number. And if you look at where we ended up in 2021, it's at 371 people. If you compare that to where we were at the end of 2020, it was closer to 230-odd folks. And so the team has grown. Part of it obviously came through the VEREIT merger, but also organically in order to continue to pursue and expand the avenues of growth, we have rightsized the team both on the research side, on the acquisition side, on the asset management side, on the property management side, et cetera, et cetera.  And so I think this is a reflection of a business that is continuing to grow and not only grow in its traditional routes, but also continue to increase new avenues of growth. And so that is going to translate into a broader personnel base as can be seen by these numbers. A lot is the short answer. If you look at our straight-line cap rate for 2021, the headline number was I think 5 4 for the fourth quarter, but there's 80 basis points of straight line. So it's really a 6.2% straight-line cap rate for the fourth quarter. And so you can imagine the only way to generate 80 basis points of straight-line rent on an annual basis is through these higher growth rates embedded in the leases. And so that is a conscious effort on the part of Mark and Neil's teams who continue to generate that inherent growth profile that we have traditionally and make that a much higher number going forward.  And so part of how we think about looking at new opportunities, new verticals, is to see the profile of the existing leases that are percolating in the market within those spaces. And that is certainly an element that we take into consideration before deciding to pursue routes. Christie, do you want to take that? Yes, Katy, I won't go through the areas that we are internally discussing, exploring, underwriting, because that becomes an exercise in futility, right? We talk about certain avenues and they don't materialize, and then it becomes a constant question in every subsequent call as to when we are going to go into it. We'd much rather consummate a transaction, get it over the finish line and then discuss our rationale as to why we chose to go down the path of entering into that new area. But suffice to say, Katy, we are exploring multiple avenues of growth. And some of the discussions that we've had on this call should give you an insight into what is driving our thought process around new avenues that we would like to consider going forward. But I just don't want to engage in a conversation right now, Katy, with respect to going into too much details on what those are because some may never materialize. And so just bear with us, and I want to be very clear, there are new areas that we are constantly looking at. And if and when we are able to get something over the finish line, we will absolutely talk to you, and you can grill us on the details as to the why we chose to pursue those routes. Christie, you want to take that? Sure, Joshua. So there is a parking lot that is across the street from where the main building is located. Today, if you talk to Craig and his team, they're actually having to pass on some of the patrons given the lack of parking space that is required to accommodate this increase in traffic. So the goal is for them to develop a multistoried aboveground, potentially even below ground parking that is going to not just be a parking lot, but also it's going to have an entertainment venue of up to 1,000 seats, maybe it's 999 seats. Plus a few other entertainment areas right in that -- in the same building that is going to get constructed across the street. And it's going to have an enclosed tunnel, aboveground tunnel pathway that leads right into the casino into the Encore Boston Harbor building from this building. And so the expectation is that this is going to get built over the next couple of years and will actually add to the overall performance of the building.  And clearly, this is a very symbiotic relationship between this parking lot, this enclosed pathway that's going to connect the 2 buildings. And so we -- they have the ability -- once constructed, and there's a 6-year time frame within which they have to do this, which gives them plenty of time to be able to consummate their current plans. We will buy this building at a 7% yield. And obviously, this should translate into even better coverages than we currently have at the particular building. But that is the option that you're referencing that's there in the lease. Josh, did that answer your question? Josh, I think, you're muted. John, I think you've been covering us for many, many years, and you probably have a very good understanding of when we talk about acquisitions, when we talk about guidance, it really does not have the underlying opportunities perfectly laid out because we don't have that visibility. There's a confidence level, there's a feel for the market. There's a feel for the opportunities that we are seeing. And that is the reason why based on the earnings guidance that came out, the underlying acquisitions guidance was above $5 billion. We don't know what the makeup or the composition of $5 billion worth of transactions are going to look like, some of which could be assets like the gaming asset that we just announced. But that's a very big asset.  So we feel now even more confident that above $5 billion is very much an achievable number, assuming that we are able to close on this transaction by the fourth quarter. But it is very difficult to say, oh, you should completely exclude this number from the $5 billion or it was inclusive of the entire $1.7 billion, just given the sheer size of this. But what it does allow us to do is stand in front of you today and say with a high level of confidence -- a higher level of confidence that achieving a north of $5 billion number for this year is, in fact, something that we feel very good about. So that's how I would answer that question. Yes. That's a very good question, John. I can tell you that based on our own internal analysis, we have obviously seen the cycle before. Rising interest rate environments, what happens to cap rates then. And what we found is that there is a positive correlation between rising interest rate environments and cap rates, but there tends to be a bit of a lag now. Is it 6 months, 9 months, 12 months? It's somewhere in that ZIP code, but there is. And if you think about it fundamentally, obviously, if cap rates are rising, especially in the private markets that leans on the debt environment a lot more, the cost of that debt is going up.  And so at some point, there's a mismatch between existing cap rates and the cost of financing that particular opportunity. And so those do tend to sort of balance out and reach an equilibrium point. That's what we've seen in years past.  There is one difference in today's environment, and that is that net lease as a product has become much, much more institutional. And we have seen a plethora of capital coming into our space on the private equity side, on the sovereign wealth side and, of course, with the preponderance of public net lease companies that have recently come into the floor.  So I think that wall of capital that is now interested in net lease is going to potentially put a curve on how quickly we get to this equilibrium point going forward. And I think in this sort of environment, once again, the fact that we are an A-, A3-rated company. And yes, our cost of debt will certainly go up and has gone up. But it will tend to go up less than a lot of our competitors who are perhaps not as rated as highly. And also in the private markets, the folks that lean on leverage a lot more and therefore, there -- the impact to their cost of capital will be much higher than the impact to ours, I think is an advantage that should allow us to continue to do transactions that others might have to step away from. So even though I believe in today's environment, that the equilibrium point might take a little bit longer to achieve. I believe that some of the advantages that Realty Income as a platform is able to sort of embrace. I do think that, that will play out more in our favor and will allow us to do things that others might not be able to get to as quickly. Yes. Linda, that's a very good question. And I think I've received questions around, \"Hey, this is a very large transaction, it's $1.7 billion. How are you going to finance it?\" For us, yes, it's a single transaction, but that the size of that transaction is -- it's not unprecedented. We just did $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter of last year. And -- just in that quarter, and we're able to match fund our acquisitions by raising our equity, $1.7 billion of equity in the fourth quarter through the ATM.  And obviously, we did some more debt on the unsecured side post the fourth quarter. So for us, I think, again, one of the big advantages that we have is the liquidity that our stock affords us. We are trading close to $200 million in stock on a daily basis and are able to very easily raise capital to match fund, what might seem nominally as being a very large number, we are able to match fund it without this overhang situation. So we -- if it closes in the third quarter or whether it closes in the fourth quarter, it doesn't really matter to us because we'll have a much better feel for it internally.  And we'll be able to match fund accordingly. So yes, it's a big number on a single asset, but I don't think we see this as necessarily causing any overhang or should not cause any overhang issues for us. Yes, Linda, that is very much a function of the type of box that we are talking about, a convenience store could be converted into a car wash or could remain a convenience store. A 10,000 square foot box could be turned into a 2 or 3-tenant box that actually generates 150%, 160% of expiring rents.  We've had examples of Pizza Hut that have been converted into Starbucks in multiple places. And there are a lot of coffee chains that are aggressively growing their portfolio and are more than willing to pay for repositioning of either previous QSRs or Pizza Hut et cetera given the location, et cetera, and are more than willing to pay us rents that are in excess of what the expiring rents were in their previous life. So those are some of the repositionings that we have accomplished to date and what we hope to be able to do because these can be quite positive from a rent per square foot perspective is to grow that part of our business going forward, and that is the goal. But yes, so far, so good. Christie, do you want to? The only other thing I'll add, Chris, is we've done liability management throughout the years. Even last year, we went ahead and we paid the 2023s and the '24s out. So this is something that we will continue to monitor. And if it makes sense, we are more than happy to prepay our unsecured bonds and take advantage of interest rate environments that we find ourselves in. So I just wanted to leave you with that, but that is certainly a tool available to us, and we will avail of it at the appropriate times. Thanks, Chris. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with many of you soon at the upcoming investor conferences. Take care. Bye-bye."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Emma (ph.) and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Realty Income Third Quarter 2021 Operating Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instruction] Thank you. Julie Hasselwander, Investor Relations at Realty Income. You may begin your conference.\nJulie Hasselwander: Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income, Third Quarter operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Christie Kelly, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities law.  The Company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the Company's Form 10-Q. We will be observing a 2-question limit during the Q&A portion of the call-in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you would like to ask additional questions, you may re-enter the queue. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy.\nSumit Roy: Thanks, Julie. Welcome, everyone. Our strong relationships with all our stakeholders enabled the success of our business, and we thank everyone listening for your continued support. Additionally, I would like to express my appreciation of our expanded Realty Income team for their tireless efforts in executing on our strategic objectives.  Today, our business is at an inflection point, where the advantages of our growing size and scale, provide us an accelerating number of opportunities, compounding our aptitude for growth. We see momentum accelerating across all facets of our business as a result of the following growth catalysts: 1. the depth and breadth of our active global pipeline remains robust. During the third quarter, we acquired over $1.6 billion of real estate across 3 countries resulting in approximately $3.8 billion year-to-date.  We now expect to invest in over $5 billion of real estate in 2021. an increase from our prior guidance of $4.5 billion. Second, we believe our expansion into Continental Europe during the third quarter with significantly deepen our addressable market at attractive spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital. Particularly given the comparatively low unsecured borrowing rates in the European bond market.  Third, our asset management activities continue to generate strong results, at the end of the third quarter, our portfolio was 98.8% occupied. And we achieved a rent recapture rate of 107.2%, illustrating the relentless efforts of our asset management team and highlighting the quality of our real estate. And finally, with the closing of the VEREIT merger, we believe our size, scale and diversification will further enhance many of our competitive advantages which we suspect should allow us to augment our investment activities in the future.  The closing upon merger with VEREIT, as well as the anticipated and subsequent spin-off of substantially all the combined Company's office properties, which has previously announced is expected to be completed on November 12, allows us to provide enhanced clarity on our near-term earnings run rate. To that end, we are increasing our 2021 AFFO per share guidance to $3.55 to $3.60 representing 5.5% annual growth at the midpoint.  And we're introducing 2022 AFFO per share guidance of $3.84 to $3.97% representing 9.2% annual growth at the midpoint. Our 2022 guidance assumes over $5 billion of acquisitions and over $40 million of year one G&A synergies we have identified as a result of economies of scale from the merger. These guidance ranges also assume that the anticipated spin-off of our office properties is consummated as anticipated on November 12th. With the closing of the merger, our combined Company eclipses $50 billion in enterprise value with size and scale to support new risk growth verticals. Providing flexibility to close large transactions without creating concentration risk.  Additionally, through this merger, Realty Income has inherited a pipeline platform and talented acquisition team focused on sourcing higher-yielding products that will be additive to our existing pipeline. Further, over time, we expect to generate meaningful earnings accretion by refinancing very outstanding debt supported by our comparatively lower borrowing costs driven by our A3 A minus ratings and capacity to issue debt in lower yielding markets.  Finally, we are excited to integrate the capabilities of many talented VEREIT colleagues into the Realty Income business, as we continue to execute our growth initiatives as one team. Now turning to the results of the quarter. We continue to add attractive real estate to our portfolio at a rapid pace. During the third quarter, we sourced nearly $24 billion of acquisition opportunities, ultimately selecting and closing on less than 6%. Of the $1.6 billion of real estate we added to the portfolio in Q3, the largest industry represented was UK grocery stores.  On a revenue basis, approximately 38% of the acquisitions made during the quarter were leased to investment-grade rated clients. And our total investment grade client exposure remains approximately 50%. The weighted average remaining lease term of the assets added to our portfolio during the quarter was 13.4 years. And in aggregate, all of our acquisition activities during the quarter resulted in healthy investment spreads, up approximately 164 basis points.  As of quarter-end, our portfolio remains well diversified, including over 7,000 assets leased to approximately 650 clients who operate in 60 separate industries located in all 50 U.S. states, Puerto Rico, the UK, and Spain. Giving pro forma effect to the closing of the merger, and the anticipated spin off our combined office assets as of September 30th, 2021. our portfolio now includes over 10,500 assets located in all 50 U.S. states, Puerto Rico, the UK, and Spain.  Our international pipeline continues to add meaningful value to our portfolio, and we believe it will remain an important driver of growth going forward. In total of the nearly $24 billion in acquisition opportunities that we sourced this quarter, approximately 34% was associated with international opportunities. In the third quarter, we added approximately $532 million of high-quality real estate in the UK and Spain across 31 properties, bringing our total international portfolio to over $3.2 billion.  This quarter, our international acquisition accounted for approximately 33% of total acquisition volume. As previously announced in September, we made our debut acquisitions in Continental Europe through a sale-leaseback transaction with Carrefour in Spain. Subsequent to quarter-end, we announced the completion of an additional Carrefour transaction in Spain, bringing the value of our Continental Europe portfolio to approximately EUR160 million.  We are optimistic about our momentum in Spain as we look to replicate the success of our international growth platform throughout the continent with best-in-class operators who are leaders in their respective industries. The health of our core portfolio remains of utmost importance as we continue to expand our platform. At the end of the third quarter, occupancy was 98.8% based on property count, which represents an increase of 30 basis points as compared to last quarter. During the quarter, we released 50 units, recapturing 107.2% of expiring rent, bringing our year-to-date recapture rate to 105.5%.  We continue to report on quarterly recapture rates and believe this is one of the most objective ways to measure underlying portfolio quality in the net lease industry. Since our listing in 1994, we have executed over 3,800 releases or sales on expiring leases, recapturing over 100% of rent on those released contracts. At this time, I'll pass it over to Christie who will further discuss results from the quarter.\nChristie Kelly : Thank you Sumit. This quarter our business generated AFFO per share of $0.91. Strengthen by our acquisitions pace and the collection of almost 100% of contractual rent in the third quarter. During the quarter, our theater clients paid approximately 99.6% of contractual rent, representing a meaningful improvement compared to the 38% collection rate in the second quarter.  We continue to be encouraged by the strong box office performance of recent blockbuster releases which we believe signals the long-term viability of the theater industry. I was looking forward to the release of the James Bond film \"No Time to Die\" for months. And based on recent box office numbers, there were many across the globe. We currently have 34 of our 79 theatre assets on cash accountants, with approximately $37 million of non-straight-line reserves on our Balance Sheet.  Like our business strategy, our approach to evaluate when these 34 theater assets move back to an accrual basis and the appropriate time to reverse the allowance for bad debt reserves will be conservative and data-driven. More specifically, we will assess the likelihood of collecting on this amount by evaluating store level, and industry-wide data in conjunction with continuing payments of past due rent over a healthy period of time.  As we continue to expand our platform, we will remain steadfast and prioritizing low leverage and a conservative balance sheet strategy while financing our growth initiatives with attractively priced capital. At the quarter-end, our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was 5 times, or 4.9 times in a proforma basis adjusting for the annualized impact of acquisitions and dispositions during the quarter. Our fixed-charge coverage ratio hit an all-time high for the third quarter in a row, coming in at 6.1 times.  And during the quarter, we raised over $1.6 billion of equities, approximately $594 million, which was through an overnight offering that closed in July, and the remainder primarily through our ATM program. During the quarter, we also issued our debut green bond offering at $750 million multi-tranche sterling denominated unsecured bond offerings, which priced at a blended yield of approximately 1.48% for an 8.8-year blended tenant. We look forward to continuing to partner with our clients around sustainable practices in accordance with our Green Financing Framework.\nOperator: And now I'd like to hand our call back to Sumit.\nSumit Roy: Thank you, Christie. In summary, we are energized and pleased by the momentum we see across all areas of our business. We're proud to have close the merger with varied and we expect the benefits of this transaction to be broad and lasting. Enhancing our competitive advantages and generating shareholder value for years to come.  Going forward, the possibilities of our business will be constrained by only our imagination, we look forward to continuing to execute on our strategic growth initiatives, to strengthen our position as the global consolidator of the highly-fragmented [Indiscernible] space while providing our shareholders with compelling risk-adjusted returns over the long run. And at this time, I would like to open it up for any questions.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Again please limit yourself to two questions please re-enter the queue. Your first question comes from the line of Nate Crossett with Berenberg. Your line is unmuted.\nNate Crossett: Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the merge.\nJulie Hasselwander: Thanks, Nate.\nNate Crossett: Yes. I appreciate the color on the pipeline. I would just maybe you could give a little bit more detail, just heading into the end of the year and into next year. What is the mix look like in terms of industrial versus retail U.S versus Europe? Was there a lot of overlap in the [Indiscernible] pipeline between VEREIT [Indiscernible] or the merge? Then I'll ask my second question at same time. Just if you can comment on pricing dynamics U.S. versus Europe.\nSumit Roy: Thank you, Nate. Good questions, and yes, we're so happy to have the merger behind us. In terms of the composition of the pipeline ahead, as well as what we've achieved. What we have -- we shared with the market that they should expect the international acquisition to represent about 1/3 of our acquisition volume going forward.  In terms of pricing, given surprisingly, when I looked at the spreads that we're generating, either here in the U.S. and comparing it to what we were able to do in Europe. They are very similar for this quarter. And in some quarters, we've seen that we were able to get slightly higher yields in the international markets and in other quarters, it has been the opposite.  So, there's really -- the way we are thinking about our portfolio is through the macro lens that we've identified what it is that is of interest to us. And the area that we, play in Europe is slightly narrower and it's a function of the product that's available than what we play in the U.S. In terms of retail versus industrial, as much as we would like to do more industrial, the pricing in this market keeps us a fairly constrained to that 10%. On a good quarter we are able to get to that 15%, 17% ZIP code.  But that's the composition of the industrial makeup of the overall acquisition. The rest of it is primarily retail. In terms of investment grade versus non-investment grade, we've said this in the past and I'll repeat it again. When we look at credit and we do our own analysis, we don't go out saying if it's a non-investment grade credit, we immediately disqualify it for consideration purposes.  If you look at what we were able to achieve in the third quarter, only 38% of what we did was investment-grade. So, we're very comfortable looking at non-investment grade. A non-investment grade does not necessarily mean sub-investment grade. It just means that it doesn't have a rating from one of the two major rating agencies and it might actually have a sub-investment grade rating, but we're very comfortable with that.  The last question that you had as a subpar to your first question was, in terms of there being an overlap with what we are inheriting from VEREIT, and there really isn't much, there are certainly certain, acquisition opportunities that we would find [Indiscernible] as a competitor. But they play in an area that we believe can truly be additive to our overall platform. And the high-rel side.  And we're still blast to inherit this, this team. And we're really looking forward to being able to completely integrate them into our acquisitions team and have them continue to pursue the transactions that they will pursuing and potentially not be constrained by the cost of capital. So, we genuinely believe that this is going to be an incremental to the acquisitions that we were able to achieve on a standalone basis. And then with respect to pricing, I think I address that through my spread comments so, Nate, I don't know if there's anything specific you want me to dive into.\nNate Crossett: No, that's all very helpful. Thank you. I'll get back in the queue.\nSumit Roy: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Your line is unmuted.\nGreg Mc Ginniss: Thanks, Sumit. Hi, Christie. Thinking about the merger with VEREIT, where they have fewer true triple-net leases on average than you guys do. What percent of leases after the acquisition and spend are truly triple-net or will truly be triple-net. And will we be looking to offload some of those non-triple-net leases, and then in general, how should we be thinking about the level of dispositions versus the 5 $billion or more of acquisitions in 2022?\nSumit Roy: Good questions, Greg. Look, I think the only area where I felt like we probably had non-triple net leases was on the GSA side of the equation on the office sub-portfolio that they had exposure to. Otherwise largely Greg, they -- these are triple-net leases. And if you think about how this particular portfolio was put together, we'll be able to give you a lot more color once we've got it all integrated, but I'd be very surprised to find gross leases -- preponderance of gross leases on the retail side and the industrial side of the equation.  Obviously industrial products, the landlord tends to be responsible for things like roof and structure, which one could argue is not a pure triple-net lease, but that is largely the same case with respect to our portfolio as well.  But the property maintenance is still the responsibility of the client, the end of the property taxes, the insurances -- insurance on those buildings are still the responsibility of the clients, so we still view those as predominantly net leases. So, with the separation of the office assets through the spend and the GSA leases, I think we are going to be largely a net-lease portfolio, very similar to the one that we have. So, I don't think that that's going to pose any major issues, Greg.\nGreg Mc Ginniss: Okay. Yes, I was just looking at their various disclosure, has a net around 30% on the retail side, 40 something percent on the industrial side, it's double net, but I get your point on the level of obligation that's really entailing. And then in terms of the level of disposition we should be thinking about whether there's any cleanup there, or just in general versus the $5 billion of acquisitions?\nSumit Roy: Yeah. We've been doing about a $100 million to a $150 million. The audio we've gone past $200 million in dispositions on a standalone basis. We would like to inherit and really do a similar analysis on the portfolio that we are inheriting with VEREIT to see if that needs to be altered. A lot of the capital recycling that they were doing pre -merger was on the office side of the equation.  And so, I don't know if the number will dramatically increase beyond a linear extrapolation of going -- adding another $10 billion, $14 billion of assets. So maybe the 150 becomes 250, 275. But give us a quarter to digest this and filter it through our own asset management lens and we'd be able to come back to you with a lot more precise indication. But we don't suspect that it's going to be dramatically different from the run rate that we were doing on a standalone basis.\nGreg Mc Ginniss: Okay. And then just one quick point of clarification on the $24 billion [Indiscernible] opportunities, you said 34% was international, is that all of Europe or is that just UK and Spain for now?\nSumit Roy: Primarily UK and Spain, but we are certainly looking at other geographies that we have identified as core to our expansion objectives but it is primarily in the UK and Spain.\nGreg Mc Ginniss: So, we could see that source number go up as you start looking more intent.\nSumit Roy: As we start expanding, yes, you should expect that to go up.\nGreg Mc Ginniss: Okay. Thank you.\nSumit Roy: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nBrad Heffern: Thanks, everyone. Hey, how are you? On the acquisition guide for 2022, you've talked about how the VEREIT team, the additive but then the guide is the same, the same over $5 billion for 2022. So, is that just beginning of the year conservativism because there's limited visibility in the pipeline or how should we think about that?\nSumit Roy: Look, what did we start this year with? It was right around $3.25 billion. Then we went up to $4.5 and now we're about $5. And we want to come out with numbers that we are -- we have a very high level of certainty associated with it. And as we start to develop our pipeline and visibility, we expect that number to go up. But we don't want to come out with a number that we feel like it's overly aggressive coming out of the gate.  So, this has been something that has been very important to us to be able to deliver to the market what we say we will deliver. And as such, you should consider this to be our initial guidance. And the hope is we can do better than that. And with time and as soon as we are in the next year, we hope to be able to get more precise around what the acquisition guidance will ultimately turn out to be.\nBrad Heffern: Okay. Next one. Maybe for you, Christie. Also, on the '22 guidance, is there anything in there that would be considered kind of one-time in nature, like maybe a reserve release from the theaters or anything like that. We need to consider?\nChristie Kelly : Hi, Brad. There is nothing of a onetime nature, including reversal at the theater returns.\nBrad Heffern: Okay. Thank you.\nChristie Kelly : You bet.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Your line is now open.\nHaendel St. Juste: Hello out there.\nSumit Roy: Hi Haendel.\nChristie Kelly : Hi Haendel.\nHaendel St. Juste: So, I was intrigued by your comments, you mentioned inheriting a team that experienced acquiring high-yielding assets, that'll be added to your platform, and then you also mentioned being very comfortable acquiring hiring yield.  I was going to ask you this quarter's 38% investment grade volume was an anomaly, but it doesn't sound like it is. So maybe, can you talk us through your thoughts on portfolio strategy with regards to high-grade going forward and if you are signaling, perhaps a slight shift in your overall thinking of portfolio strategy.\nSumit Roy: I'm here to alleviate any confusion Haendel. There are a lot of -- if you look at our top 10 clients and we have Carrefour that shows up there. And Carrefour is a non-rated Company. Yet if you were to look at its Balance Sheet and you were to look at its credit metrics, it would imply a very strong investment grade credit but that does not show up in the 38% investment-grade.  So, we've been playing in the area that we've identified coming out of the strategy sessions that we alluded to in the past. And we feel -- sorry, that's actually Sainsbury it's not Carrefour. Carrefour is actually rated triple B. So, when we come out and we share with you the actual investment-grade numbers, it is truly an investment grade rate rating by either S&P or Moody's.  But we play across the spectrum. But we are so focused in the area that we've identified as our area of growth that -- are we as focused in some of the higher-yielding product that our inherited team from VEREIT was focused on. Potentially not. Are we going to do everything that VEREIT was acquiring as a standalone Company? Probably not. But we are trying to create a team and we truly believe that team to be complementary to ours and now it's one team that is going to be able to play across the credit spectrum and be able to truly be an incremental source of acquisitions for us going forward. S o there'll be quarters where we do more than 38%, in fact, we've done up to 50%, 60% of investment-grade, and then there'll be other quarters where we don't. I don't want you to put too much rating to this headline number of how much investment-grade are we actually pursuing, because as I've said to you, that that's a by-product of our strategy, not what drives our strategy.\nHaendel St. Juste: Great, appreciate the thoughts and clearing that up. Christie, not to beat a dead horse, we've talked about it over the last quarter too, it's been asked on the call today and I guess I'm really still a little reflector still surprised that there hasn't been a recognition of revenues of the movie theatre site. You pointed out a number of the positive industry dynamics that the industry is experiencing here. So is it just more [Indiscernible] And it sounds like certainly right now there isn't any of that in your 20-22 guide. So just trying to square your comments with the I guess the lack of recognition or any sense of timing on that.\nChristie Kelly : It really, in a nutshell, is timing. We did in the third quarter experience payoffs according to our deferred arrangements, the handful of theater properties and they're back on accrual counting. And we'll continue to evaluate on an asset-by-asset basis and we still have remnants of COVID out there.  We want to make sure that we're evaluating this, not only on an asset-by-asset basis, but also just in terms of what's happening in an [Indiscernible] macro perspective. So, more time. And we'll be back to report to you.\nHaendel St. Juste: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.\nChristie Kelly : You bet, Haendel.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nCaitlin Burrows: Hi everyone, congrats on the merger and all the recent progress. Maybe digging a little deeper on the pipeline, I'm wondering if you can talk about the difference in what you're interested in abroad versus the U.S. I think you mentioned that the abroad pipeline might be a little bit narrower?\nSumit Roy: Yeah, Caitlin, it's just not as developed -- and partly it's driven by being land constrained. You don't have as many freestanding triple-net opportunities in terms of various industries and various tenants being in that space. Obviously, the size of the actual market is 2x what we have here in the U.S. But the number of industries that mend itself to sort of this triple-net concept are a bit narrower. We've already talked about grocery as being one of the areas that we'd like to focus in on. Hold improvement is another area.  But it is very unusual to find some of the other industries that we're exposed to on the retail side, being available in mainland Europe. And that's really the point I'm trying to make, this is not the constraining factor because I think we put out some numbers, etc. sharing with you how much bigger the actual market is, the addressable market is in Europe that lends itself to net leasable investing. But it really is more of an -- it's just a narrower group of industries that play in that space.\nCaitlin Burrows: Got it. Okay. And then given your larger size now, do you expect there to be any change in sourcing over the next year? And as a result of that, do you think there will be any meaningful change in your acquisition cap rates?\nSumit Roy: I hope so. I absolutely believe that with the newly expanded team that includes folks from what was VEREIT, we will be able to increase our run rate on the acquisition front, and we will be able to cover the credit spectrum a lot more precisely and acutely than we were able to do on a standalone basis, and that should result in not only higher sourcing, but getting more transactions over the finish line.  And that is absolutely one of the levers that we hope will play out for us. And based on everything that we've seen and based on getting to know our new colleagues better, I absolutely believe that is going to play out next year and beyond. So, but time will tell. But that is our expectation.\nCaitlin Burrows: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nSumit Roy: Absolutely.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nRonald Kamdem: Hey, congrats on the VEREIT merger. Just 2 quick ones from me. The first is just going back to acquisition, and I think you've talked about what of a new $50 billion plus enterprise value less concentration risk. There are just more opportunities that present themselves. So, I guess the question is really, is the team doing anything organizationally different to try to source those deals or is the point that historically when those yields have come up, you've had the path on them, but now you could take a look at it. Thanks.\nSumit Roy: It wasn't that we were passing on deals, Ronald, it was more along the lines of -- if you look at some of our industry concentration, they were starting to creep to double-digit ZIP codes and somewhat beyond that. And the complementary nature of what we are inheriting from VEREIT, I believe, helps us on a couple of industries.  If you look at a few of our largest industries like convenience stores and groceries, etc. All of those concentrations on a pro forma basis, it's actually going to come down. And so, it gives us more capacity to aggressively pursue opportunities that we are finding incredibly compelling to try to get over the finish line. So, it just gives us more capacity, that's one.  The second is, being a much larger Company, and this is a more recent phenomenon, I think 2 years ago, maybe a little bit longer than that, was the first time I heard of a billion-dollar sale-leaseback opportunity in our space, and it was on the retail side of the equation. And we've never heard of opportunities of that size. And even for us, if we had some prior exposure to the client doing a billion-dollar transaction, what's going to start to push the concentration risk issue, and now being 1.3 times, 1.4 times the size that we were -- it is less of an issue.  And the size of sale-leaseback opportunities that are now in play are billion-dollars opportunities. Now, we haven't really seen -- there have been announcements, but we haven't seen anything get over the finish line on that front. But that to us is exactly the type of transactions that we would like to be able to show up for and be able to do and be a single-point solution for some of our clients that we perhaps would not have been able to pursue in our previous version.  And so, I think that really is what we feel will be one of the biggest beneficiaries. And also, proactively to go to some of these larger companies and be able to say -- and then for large companies by definition, doing a $500 million sale-leaseback doesn't really move the needle for them much. And so, to be able to be a solution and provide multi-billion-dollar sale-leaseback opportunities for them, I think could be a lot more compelling.  And so those are the types of things that we'd be able to pursue post this closing that we obviously thought a lot about in the past and we have approached certain clients, but it was -- we were guided by what we were hearing in terms of what is really relevant for some of these folks. I think, time will tell, but it certainly creates the platform for us to now be able to pursue some of these transactions which we were not able to as aggressively pursue in the past. Ronald?\nRonald Kamdem: Yes. Sorry about that. Great. My second question was just going to 2022 guidance. Obviously appreciate the transparency and I can appreciate these are preliminary numbers. But when I think about the AFFO guidance range, can you maybe share what that assumes in terms of same-store rent growth than the assumptions for reserves for credit losses.\nSumit Roy: We obviously gave you a couple of numbers when we came out with this. The point of coming out with a guidance at this point in the cycle, which is non-traditional for us, was largely driven by this acquisition that we did of VEREIT, and there was a lot of uncertainty around what does proforma Realty Income really look like post separation of the office assets.  And this was our attempt to sort of address that going forward. And so, in terms of the other ascension's like same-store rent and other inputs that go into the model, it is largely along the lines of what we've done in the past.  And so, you should -- and, of course, as we learn more about the portfolio that we've acquired and we look out into the future and we, more importantly, digest the 6 -- the $5 billion acquisition guidance that we have for this year, I think we'd be in a much better position to give you much more precise numbers on same-store growth etc. But for right now, you should assume it to be the 1% that we usually point to.\nRonald Kamdem: Great. Thank you.\nSumit Roy: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brent Dilts with UBS. Your line is now open.\nChristie Kelly : Hi, Brent.\nBrent Dilts: Hi, Christie. I've just got a qualitative one at this point, but with the acquisitions in Spain during the quarter, could you talk about what you learned from the transactions and just how does that impact your approach in Continental Europe going forward. And I think in recent calls, you guys have spoken about trying to learn the local market and there's a lot of nuance to it. So maybe you could just provide a little color around your experience there.\nSumit Roy: Sorry. Are you asking us what is our filter of going into new markets? Is that the question Brent?\nBrent Dilts: No, sorry, Sumit, it's more just what did you learn specifically from the process itself as far as like nuance to the deal structures or the negotiations, or just anything about the market that maybe you picked up.\nSumit Roy: Brent, I'll tell you very honestly, we did a lot of homework before we actually went into any particular market. We looked at transactions that have taken place in the past, we tried to understand the nuances of the structures, we considered the tax implications, a lot of the homework was done prior to us actually engaging with potential clients or the advisory community to start to pursue transaction.  So, I would say that we weren't overly surprised by the structure of the deals that we've been able to get over the finish line. The one thing that has surprised me personally, and I don't know if Neil and Mark are going to share in my comment, but it's the volume comment, I do believe that we have been able to create these relationships that have cemented to, and have translated into subsequent transactions much more quickly than what we had originally thought.  This is very much a relationship-driven market, which we anticipated but not to the extent that we've seen it play out. They are looking for long-term partners. They're looking for partners that are not in the market to flip out assets and that is right down the fairway for who we are and how we believe in generating value for our investors long-term.  The certainty of close to some is incredibly important, far more so than perhaps here in the U.S., it's not that certainty of close is not important, but they are much more price sensitive here in the U.S., than perhaps in continental Europe, as well as in the UK. So, reputation, size, scale. The fact that we do what we say does seem to be weighed a lot more significantly in all of Europe than what we had anticipated. So that's where the surprise came in, not in terms of the duration of the lease or the cap rates or the growth that we find embedded in these leases. A lot of that was known to us before we went into these markets.\nBrent Dilts: Okay, great. That's it from me, guys. Thank you.\nSumit Roy: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Q - John Massocca with Ladenburg Thalmann. Your line is now open.\nJohn Massocca: Good afternoon.\nChristie Kelly : Hi. John.\nJohn Massocca: Just looking at a leasing spread renewal and releasing [Indiscernible] assets, the third quarter where you're in well above, I guess what -- even recent historical level. Do you think that above 100% recovery is sustainable here or is that maybe more reflection of where we are in the macroeconomic cycle, given the pandemic?\nSumit Roy: John, that's a good question. And if you're asking me, can we do positive 7% with next to no capital investments every quarter going forward? I think the answer is probably no. But I do think that over the last 8, 12 and even during the pandemic, the kind of releasing that we've been able to achieve without a bunch of capital investments is a testament to the quality of the portfolio that we have.  But much more importantly, it's a testament to the asset management team under the tutelage of Janine (ph.) that we are able to generate these numbers. And so, I feel like if you look at the trend and you look at what we've been able to do over the last 3, 4 years, we have generally achieved north of 100% releasing spreads.  And this by the way includes not just clients who are renewing an option, but also new clients that we are bringing in, into either empty buildings or buildings that are about to go empty. So, this is the complete picture of what we've been able to achieve. And that is one of the points that we've been trying to talk about that our business, on a normalized basis, is going to become a seven-year world business.  And a lot of value is either going to get created through this channel or not. And we've been anticipating this and building out our asset management team in anticipation of being able to generate the kind of results that we are posting on a quarter-by-quarter basis. So, we feel very good that we -- and we usually target above 100% every quarter and we've been able to do far better than that. And I'll leave it at that.\nJohn Massocca: Okay. And then switching gears a little bit back to international, I think can we be pre -pandemic if you look that kind of [Indiscernible] for the UK acquisitions versus the U.S., right UK was always fairly significantly lower than U.S. acquisitions in that spread has kind of disappeared. Also, on top of each other in terms of day one cap rate.  So, is that a factor you think of macro, economic pushes and pulls interest rates, et cetera, or is that a more reflective of different kind of investments that you are targeting either internationally or here domestically?\nSumit Roy: It is certainly the latter. And if you're looking at grocery businesses here in the U.S., there's been a tremendous amount of compression that we've seen on the cap rate side of the equation. And I would say that the U.S. market has moved more towards the UK market than the other way around.  But there are differences to the lease structures, etc., and once again, I'm not going to go into the details, but what you see as that headline cap rate, you're seeing that they seem to be very close. There is some inter-quarter variability like I believe in the second quarter we had a slightly higher cap rate associated with international, and it was a function of the type of assets that we got, and the length of the lease terms that we were able to achieve or translated to higher cap rates.  But by and large, the spread which considers both the cap rate as well as the cost of capital, is very similar right now, very, very similar in both these markets. But I do think it's partly driven by -- we are playing in a much narrower industry spectrum in Europe. And we have been doing a lot more industrial here in the U.S. And it sorts of balances out and it yields a number that you see as the headline number posted on our supplemental.\nJohn Massocca: That was very helpful. Thank you very much.\nSumit Roy: Thank you.\nOperator: Thanks. Your next question comes from the line of Wes Golladay with Baird. Your line is now open.\nWes Golladay: Hi everyone. Quick question on the acquisition volume this year. Hi, Christie. When you look at what's driving the upside, is it more on the sale leaseback side or is the developer takeout\u2019s broker deals, just trying to get a handle on where the [Indiscernible] is coming from.\nSumit Roy: It's a combination of all forms of development. We are doing takeout\u2019s, we are doing -- we're actually financing 100% of developments. The one common thread is that in the vast majority of the cases, there's a lease in hand. You might see that there's a retail asset wealth, I think on the retail side, it was 93% occupied.  And that's largely driven by repositioning that we're doing. And we don't quite have the lease in hand for that one particular unit. But otherwise, it's all built-to-suit. But we play across the spectrum, providing all of the development funding, as well as doing takeout.\nWes Golladay: Okay and then when we look to next year's guidance, you do have about $750 million of high coupon debt in 2023 that is due, is it safe to assume that's not in the number or prepayment of that?\nSumit Roy: I'll let Christie answer that.\nChristie Kelly : [Indiscernible]\nWes Golladay: Okay. Thanks for taking the questions.\nSumit Roy: Thank you.\nChristie Kelly : Thanks Wes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Katy McConnell with Citi. Your line is now open.\nMichael Bilerman: Hey, it's Michael Bilerman here with Katie. I want to come back on the pipeline. Just come back on the $5 billion for next year. And I take your comments are trying to be conservative, it's early, you want to sort of see what the combination of the teams can do. But how did you come up with a $5 billion, you didn't pull it out of thin air, there has to been some rigor to come up with that. So, can you just walk through sort of the analysis and that you went through to come up with that $5 billion.\nSumit Roy: Sure. Look, I think as we get more and more comfortable with the strategy that we are currently executing, Michael, it gives us a lot more confidence to be able to say that this is a product that we're seeing. This is the translation rate on that product on the sourcing numbers. We feel very comfortable given the team and infrastructure we have in place that we are going to be able to accomplish the numbers that we've posted.  This year was a very interesting year for us because we had a very healthy pipeline. just like we do today come into the year. But it was post-pandemic and we didn't quite know how things are going to play out. But we felt very good about coming in and saying 3.25 billion, which we have since revised a couple of times.  And so, as we're getting more and more comfortable with the new markets that we're entering into, with the sourcing volumes that we're seeing, with the maturation of the team that we have in place, that's what is giving us the confidence. In the beginning, I assume, talk with my colleagues and we would earmark about 20% to 25% international, well today it's closer to 30%, 35% percent. We've built out the team in the international side.  We have a much more mature team and a fantastic team on the U.S side, and now we're going to inherit a group of veterans from this acquisition. So that's really the buildup that we've done internally and we feel fairly confident about to come out and say, look this year we're going to do north of 5 billion. we should be able to do that with the level of visibility and 1 year behind us now, in 2022. So that's how we came up with that number.\nMichael Bilerman: Which hearing that would sound extraordinarily conservative, given all the arrows that you have in your quiver to be able to execute additional acquisitions, especially given your other comments about being a bigger Company, allows you to take on different risks, which arguably being a big Company, if you went out and did a billion-dollar portfolio then had $100 million of assets that you didn't want, well, $100 million or $50 billion isn\u2019t that much.  How does that play into your thinking about deal flow from here? And I think you and I talked a little bit about this last quarter or the quarter before, in terms of your willingness to now accept what previously was larger risks that you may be willing to take today in terms of either type of asset, location of asset, credit of tenant, all the variety of things that may have made you pass on deals before?\nSumit Roy: I hope what you're saying is exactly right and a year from now we have a number that is far in excess of the $5 billion that we're coming out with Michael. What we don't want to do is have a particular number dictate our decision-making. We want to come out, and this is right along the lines of how we've operated the business. This is the largest acquisition volume number that we're going to be coming out with in our history. You're right, this is by design that we've created all these avenues and we should be increasing our guidance.  And perhaps there is a level of conservatism. But we would like nothing better to come in in February and revise our numbers and say, you know what, we've had a chance to revisit and be able to come in and with a high level of confidence, given all of these new strategies that we are putting a lot more effort into i.e. 1. higher yielding, 2. newer markets, 3. being able to have one quarter, 4. under our belt in Spain, 5. figuring out what we can or can't do there.  All of that hopefully will translate into higher numbers. But this is where we feel that we don't want to over-promise and under-deliver. And that's the reason why we're coming out with what we're coming out with.\nMichael Bilerman: And then in terms of just from a corporate perspective, I seem time that you're going to talk to large tenants that have a lot of real estate on their books, you are much better equipped today at your size to be able to do those elephant hunting types of transactions.  How active are you in going to those corporations that have the real estate on their books where you can do a direct deal in a much larger scale? And are those further along and -- you have other capital partners as we've seen, there's a lot of institutional capital that would love to get access to the type of portfolios and higher yielding levered plays that you're doing, and so I'm just I'd like to know a little bit more on that front whether we could expect that to be a much bigger part of the story.\nSumit Roy: In the past, we have to consider partners when we were coming across these multi-billion-dollar sale-leaseback opportunities. But I think the need for that has diminished post this acquisition. We had inbounded from investors who wanted to participate on these one-off transactions, larger transactions outside of the realm of the public eye.  And we've largely stayed away from that because we felt like the transactions that we were actually seeing in the market that was near-term we could have handled all on our own. We haven't had to pursue a partnership very aggressively.  And I think the need for that has diminished even more so now, with this proforma for the very transaction, and I do believe that our willingness and desire to more actively pursue potential clients that we -- that we've talked about, that we might want to speak with and engage with is a lot higher today, given that the concentration issues that we could have entered into are somewhat muted now. And so, I do think that those types of conversations are going to be a little bit more front and center in terms of what we do. And we are going through it much more proactively. That's correct.\nMichael Bilerman: Okay. And then the second topic -- last topic is about the office in -- obviously, when you announced the transaction, there was a discussion about not having a plan in place to deal with those assets that you didn't want and be able to contribute the office assets on your Balance Sheet. And you said you were going to pursue two paths, you'd have the spin as you're basically backup option and look at sales process.  Can you talk us through what led you down the path of an office spin and thinking about the dis-synergies from a G&A perspective, how you thought about the value that you would be delivering to your combined shareholder base versus a sale and taking the cash. Why spin versus sale?\nSumit Roy: So, you should assume that when we discussed the separation of the office assets, we were very clear with the market that we would have -- that we're going to pursue either a span out or a sale. And we did and where we concluded going through those to parallel path was that the spin is a far better option given where we were coming out on the sales side than not, which is precisely why we decided to choose to go down the spinning of the office assets. Putting a team that was very familiar with all of those assets, had been working very hard on assets managing those assets was, very capable of creating value longer term.  And what we -- the analysis that we went through was to say, okay, they have the thesis. It's a thesis that makes sense. There are some tailwinds in that particular sub sector. Given the success that they've been able to achieve over the last couple of years, you look at that and then you start to see what they can do with this portfolio going forward.  From an alternative perspective, this seems like the absolute right alternative for us to pursue despite the fact that selling the assets would have been an easier step for Realty Income to take. But we did pursue both those efforts in power loan and this is the path that on a risk-adjusted basis yielded the superior outcome for us, and that's the reason why we pursued it.\nMichael Bilerman: Okay thanks for the time.\nSumit Roy: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nJosh Dennerlein: Yeah. Hey guys. Hope everyone's doing well. Now that the VEREIT merger's behind you, you curious, you added a bunch of teammates, any skill set that was brought in that would help you guys widen the aperture?\nSumit Roy: Yeah, Josh, that's what we were -- sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt. Go ahead.\nJosh Dennerlein: No, no, please, please.\nSumit Roy: That's what we've been adhering to Josh when we're talking about being able to have a team that is very capable of playing across the credit spectrum for a lack of better phrase, the higher-yielding assets, the lower-yielding assets and being able to cover that entire spectrum with a much broader team.  That is one of the biggest advantages that we are inheriting from -- through this acquisition. And there are other advantages of teammates that we are inheriting, not just on the acquisition front, but also on, when you look at some of the data analytics work that we're planning on doing, some of the process re-engineering work that we're doing.  They have a few very talented folks in their team that will become part of some of these opportunities that we are already building out and executing upon and be able to be tremendously additive and help us accelerate some of these opportunities to the finish line and create even more efficiency. So, it's really -- I am so proud of the team that we have inherited and it's [Indiscernible] 100 people that will really help us become a complete team. And of course, helped us absorb north of 3,000 properties, which is not a not a small foot.\nJosh Dennerlein: Got it. And one other question, I guess relates to dividend strategy going forward. Just kind of curious to hear your thoughts on maybe how about or things about the payout ratio and retained earnings.\nSumit Roy: So, our payout ratio is in the high 70s today. We will always be the monthly dividend Company. It took us over 25 years to become part of the Dividend Aristocrat Index, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index. This is very core to our strategy going forward. And so, in years where we can grow 9.5% or 9.2% and the midpoint of the range that we've just shared with you, that will just continue to help us grow our dividends in the future.  And that is -- there will be no change to that strategy of annual growth on the dividend going forward. So really no change, Josh, but I just wanted to make sure given that you asked the question that I emphasize how important than core dividend growth is to Realty Income and nothing that we've done either recently or in the past is going to change that.\nJosh Dennerlein: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nLinda Tsai: Hello. With 85% of your leases having some type of contractual rent increased, can you remind us what kind of increases you obtained on the European leases versus domestic, and then across the entire portfolio going forward, what might be average weighted rent increase look like versus what it is now?\nSumit Roy: Yeah. Linda, I'm not going to give you precise information. I think it is of strategic importance to us to not be that precise on growth by geography. I will tell you that 85% of our leases have contractual growth.  Either they are in the form of fixed growth, or they are in the form of CPI adjustments, or there are percentage rent clauses into the contract. It's one of those 3 variations that make up the growth profile. You can continue to underwrite to 1% same-store growth for our business going forward, and we will update you as and when warranted, but for right now, that is the assumption you should have for your models.\nLinda Tsai: Thanks. And then how should we think about the pacing mix of capital raising activity in 2022 as you move forward with a plus $5 billion acquisition run rate?\nChristie Kelly : I think -- go ahead Sumit\nSumit Roy: No, no, no, please Christie, go ahead.\nChristie Kelly : I'll just kick it off to say I think Linda, you can expect that to be consistent with our personal [Indiscernible] this year, in funding our business and continuing to pursue a very competitive cost of capital while maintaining our net debt-to-EBITDA.\nLinda Tsai: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities. Your line is now open.\nChris Lucas: Good afternoon, everybody, thank you for taking my questions. Really just to -- a lot of the questions have been asked and answered, but I guess just Sumit, given that scale the Company at this point and where your credit rating is.  I guess, I'm just curious as to your conversations with the rating agencies post-merger. So, if you've gotten any flexibility or indication from them that you have more flexibility on your leverage side to maintain those very high credit ratings?\nSumit Roy: I'll share the headline, but I'll let Christie speak to this point because she actually had the conversation along with Jonathan with the two-credit rate -- rating agencies. They were very supportive. When we in fact went back after our third quarter announcements and spoke with them, they were again, very complementary.  They solve the capital raising that we did and essentially front-loaded the funding of our acquisition pipeline. They continue to reaffirm their current stance of A minus A3 rating and a stable outlook. We feel like we're going to have 2 months of earnings associated with this closing. But all of the Balance Sheet, day 1, so the numbers are going to look a little bit off.  But on a proforma basis for annualized earnings, it's going to be right where we play and where the rating agencies are incredibly comfortable. So, I don't see us being put on any sort of a negative watch or what have you. We've tried to be very transparent, we've shared all the analysis with the rating agencies, and we feel very confident that they will continue to support us and maintain us at the current levels. Christie\nChris Lucas: I was just actually going to put it the other way. I'm wondering whether the scale of the Company and the diversification of the portfolio is going to allow you to do more leverage and keep the range that's really where I'm going with this.\nSumit Roy: That's a good question, Chris. I don't know the answer to that. And it's very difficult to even enter into a hypothetical with the rating agencies about that particular scenario. It's an -- they tend to be a bit of a black box. And we didn't change our leverage profile that when we were on this way up. And this, I think lends credence to the comments you're making  Chris, but we can't expect that and truth be told, we are very happy with A - /A3 rating, I think. I don't know what the incremental benefit would be getting to an Aa2 rating, but I don't know if it's going to be as significant as going from triple B plus to A minus. But it's a good question and one that I think now that you've asked, we 'll post to the rating agencies to figure out how they're going to think about this.\nChris Lucas: And then just a sort of a secondary question, when you think about how you want to finance your business, you mentioned this European rate are more attractive right now than the U.S. for financing. Would you think about financing at a higher level relative to asset base in Europe at this point than you do in the U.S from a debt-finance perspective? And how high would you go?\nSumit Roy: Yes, for us Chris, we've been very clear about what the limiting factor has been for us in Europe, we want to use domestic capital to finance as much of our acquisition as possible. But the limiting factor is always going to be the asset value.  And so that's one of the biggest advantages that we have is we can raise debt in any geography and in an environment where we see here in the U.S. as the rising 10-year U.S. Treasury not so much today, but expected. We could do a lot more on the unsecured side, assuming we continue to grow in the UK or in mainland Europe, as we grow out there.  But the constraining factor will always be what's on the left side of the Balance Sheet. And does it support, the raising or not. But could it be more levered there than here in the U.S.? Absolutely. That's one of the big advantages of why we did what we did. And on a fully consolidated basis, which is how we think about our business, we're very comfortable implementing that particular strategy.\nChris Lucas: Super. That's all I had today. Thank you so much.\nSumit Roy: Of course, Chris. Thank you.\nChristie Kelly : Thanks Chris.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Spenser Allaway with Green Street. Your line is now open.\nChristie Kelly : Hi Spenser.\nSpenser Allaway: Hi. I know you spoke about development earlier; can you just more broadly talk about how the development economics vary between the U.S and Europe? And if possible, can you provide some color around what kind of deals you're expecting on the one UK development you have underway?\nSumit Roy: Hi Spenser, we're going to stay away from speaking about specific transactions. We just don't do that. And then I'm going to be asked to remember of 400 properties that we acquired. What is the cap rate on the 388 property? And it's just going to be impossible. That's really the reason why we're staying away from being very precise about specific transactions and we tried to report it to you on a fully consolidated basis.  There is no doubt that we are able to get slightly higher yield on development projects than we would on assets that are ready for delivery. And that could range. It could range anywhere between -- and by the way, that has compressed, but it could range anywhere between 25 basis points to on the odd occasion, maybe 75 basis points, 80 basis points. It used to be north of 100 basis points not too long ago. But for us, we are a yield-driven business.  Every incremental yield is a positive for us Spenser. I do believe that in our supplement, we do provide that level of clarity, we do breakout what the development yields are, and so you should be able to track that as part of our overall acquisition volume, and how much of it is attributable to the development funding. And you will see that it's definitely higher than what we are actually acquiring assets and that's just a testament to our relationships and being able to balance out the overall portfolio. And that's the strategy we continue to play out.\nChristie Kelly : Thank you, Spenser\nSpenser Allaway: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income's conference call. I will now turn the call over to Sumit Roy for concluding remarks.\nSumit Roy: Thank you, everyone for coming, and we look forward to seeing a lot of you at Nerige. Goodbye.",

            "content": "Thank you Sumit. This quarter our business generated AFFO per share of $0.91. Strengthen by our acquisitions pace and the collection of almost 100% of contractual rent in the third quarter. During the quarter, our theater clients paid approximately 99.6% of contractual rent, representing a meaningful improvement compared to the 38% collection rate in the second quarter.  We continue to be encouraged by the strong box office performance of recent blockbuster releases which we believe signals the long-term viability of the theater industry. I was looking forward to the release of the James Bond film \"No Time to Die\" for months. And based on recent box office numbers, there were many across the globe. We currently have 34 of our 79 theatre assets on cash accountants, with approximately $37 million of non-straight-line reserves on our Balance Sheet.  Like our business strategy, our approach to evaluate when these 34 theater assets move back to an accrual basis and the appropriate time to reverse the allowance for bad debt reserves will be conservative and data-driven. More specifically, we will assess the likelihood of collecting on this amount by evaluating store level, and industry-wide data in conjunction with continuing payments of past due rent over a healthy period of time.  As we continue to expand our platform, we will remain steadfast and prioritizing low leverage and a conservative balance sheet strategy while financing our growth initiatives with attractively priced capital. At the quarter-end, our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was 5 times, or 4.9 times in a proforma basis adjusting for the annualized impact of acquisitions and dispositions during the quarter. Our fixed-charge coverage ratio hit an all-time high for the third quarter in a row, coming in at 6.1 times.  And during the quarter, we raised over $1.6 billion of equities, approximately $594 million, which was through an overnight offering that closed in July, and the remainder primarily through our ATM program. During the quarter, we also issued our debut green bond offering at $750 million multi-tranche sterling denominated unsecured bond offerings, which priced at a blended yield of approximately 1.48% for an 8.8-year blended tenant. We look forward to continuing to partner with our clients around sustainable practices in accordance with our Green Financing Framework. Hi, Brad. There is nothing of a onetime nature, including reversal at the theater returns. You bet. Hi Haendel. It really, in a nutshell, is timing. We did in the third quarter experience payoffs according to our deferred arrangements, the handful of theater properties and they're back on accrual counting. And we'll continue to evaluate on an asset-by-asset basis and we still have remnants of COVID out there.  We want to make sure that we're evaluating this, not only on an asset-by-asset basis, but also just in terms of what's happening in an [Indiscernible] macro perspective. So, more time. And we'll be back to report to you. You bet, Haendel. Hi, Brent. Hi. John. [Indiscernible] Thanks Wes. I think -- go ahead Sumit I'll just kick it off to say I think Linda, you can expect that to be consistent with our personal [Indiscernible] this year, in funding our business and continuing to pursue a very competitive cost of capital while maintaining our net debt-to-EBITDA. Thanks Chris. Hi Spenser. Thank you, Spenser"

            "content": "Thanks, Julie. Welcome, everyone. Our strong relationships with all our stakeholders enabled the success of our business, and we thank everyone listening for your continued support. Additionally, I would like to express my appreciation of our expanded Realty Income team for their tireless efforts in executing on our strategic objectives.  Today, our business is at an inflection point, where the advantages of our growing size and scale, provide us an accelerating number of opportunities, compounding our aptitude for growth. We see momentum accelerating across all facets of our business as a result of the following growth catalysts: 1. the depth and breadth of our active global pipeline remains robust. During the third quarter, we acquired over $1.6 billion of real estate across 3 countries resulting in approximately $3.8 billion year-to-date.  We now expect to invest in over $5 billion of real estate in 2021. an increase from our prior guidance of $4.5 billion. Second, we believe our expansion into Continental Europe during the third quarter with significantly deepen our addressable market at attractive spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital. Particularly given the comparatively low unsecured borrowing rates in the European bond market.  Third, our asset management activities continue to generate strong results, at the end of the third quarter, our portfolio was 98.8% occupied. And we achieved a rent recapture rate of 107.2%, illustrating the relentless efforts of our asset management team and highlighting the quality of our real estate. And finally, with the closing of the VEREIT merger, we believe our size, scale and diversification will further enhance many of our competitive advantages which we suspect should allow us to augment our investment activities in the future.  The closing upon merger with VEREIT, as well as the anticipated and subsequent spin-off of substantially all the combined Company's office properties, which has previously announced is expected to be completed on November 12, allows us to provide enhanced clarity on our near-term earnings run rate. To that end, we are increasing our 2021 AFFO per share guidance to $3.55 to $3.60 representing 5.5% annual growth at the midpoint.  And we're introducing 2022 AFFO per share guidance of $3.84 to $3.97% representing 9.2% annual growth at the midpoint. Our 2022 guidance assumes over $5 billion of acquisitions and over $40 million of year one G&A synergies we have identified as a result of economies of scale from the merger. These guidance ranges also assume that the anticipated spin-off of our office properties is consummated as anticipated on November 12th. With the closing of the merger, our combined Company eclipses $50 billion in enterprise value with size and scale to support new risk growth verticals. Providing flexibility to close large transactions without creating concentration risk.  Additionally, through this merger, Realty Income has inherited a pipeline platform and talented acquisition team focused on sourcing higher-yielding products that will be additive to our existing pipeline. Further, over time, we expect to generate meaningful earnings accretion by refinancing very outstanding debt supported by our comparatively lower borrowing costs driven by our A3 A minus ratings and capacity to issue debt in lower yielding markets.  Finally, we are excited to integrate the capabilities of many talented VEREIT colleagues into the Realty Income business, as we continue to execute our growth initiatives as one team. Now turning to the results of the quarter. We continue to add attractive real estate to our portfolio at a rapid pace. During the third quarter, we sourced nearly $24 billion of acquisition opportunities, ultimately selecting and closing on less than 6%. Of the $1.6 billion of real estate we added to the portfolio in Q3, the largest industry represented was UK grocery stores.  On a revenue basis, approximately 38% of the acquisitions made during the quarter were leased to investment-grade rated clients. And our total investment grade client exposure remains approximately 50%. The weighted average remaining lease term of the assets added to our portfolio during the quarter was 13.4 years. And in aggregate, all of our acquisition activities during the quarter resulted in healthy investment spreads, up approximately 164 basis points.  As of quarter-end, our portfolio remains well diversified, including over 7,000 assets leased to approximately 650 clients who operate in 60 separate industries located in all 50 U.S. states, Puerto Rico, the UK, and Spain. Giving pro forma effect to the closing of the merger, and the anticipated spin off our combined office assets as of September 30th, 2021. our portfolio now includes over 10,500 assets located in all 50 U.S. states, Puerto Rico, the UK, and Spain.  Our international pipeline continues to add meaningful value to our portfolio, and we believe it will remain an important driver of growth going forward. In total of the nearly $24 billion in acquisition opportunities that we sourced this quarter, approximately 34% was associated with international opportunities. In the third quarter, we added approximately $532 million of high-quality real estate in the UK and Spain across 31 properties, bringing our total international portfolio to over $3.2 billion.  This quarter, our international acquisition accounted for approximately 33% of total acquisition volume. As previously announced in September, we made our debut acquisitions in Continental Europe through a sale-leaseback transaction with Carrefour in Spain. Subsequent to quarter-end, we announced the completion of an additional Carrefour transaction in Spain, bringing the value of our Continental Europe portfolio to approximately EUR160 million.  We are optimistic about our momentum in Spain as we look to replicate the success of our international growth platform throughout the continent with best-in-class operators who are leaders in their respective industries. The health of our core portfolio remains of utmost importance as we continue to expand our platform. At the end of the third quarter, occupancy was 98.8% based on property count, which represents an increase of 30 basis points as compared to last quarter. During the quarter, we released 50 units, recapturing 107.2% of expiring rent, bringing our year-to-date recapture rate to 105.5%.  We continue to report on quarterly recapture rates and believe this is one of the most objective ways to measure underlying portfolio quality in the net lease industry. Since our listing in 1994, we have executed over 3,800 releases or sales on expiring leases, recapturing over 100% of rent on those released contracts. At this time, I'll pass it over to Christie who will further discuss results from the quarter. Thank you, Christie. In summary, we are energized and pleased by the momentum we see across all areas of our business. We're proud to have close the merger with varied and we expect the benefits of this transaction to be broad and lasting. Enhancing our competitive advantages and generating shareholder value for years to come.  Going forward, the possibilities of our business will be constrained by only our imagination, we look forward to continuing to execute on our strategic growth initiatives, to strengthen our position as the global consolidator of the highly-fragmented [Indiscernible] space while providing our shareholders with compelling risk-adjusted returns over the long run. And at this time, I would like to open it up for any questions. Thank you, Nate. Good questions, and yes, we're so happy to have the merger behind us. In terms of the composition of the pipeline ahead, as well as what we've achieved. What we have -- we shared with the market that they should expect the international acquisition to represent about 1/3 of our acquisition volume going forward.  In terms of pricing, given surprisingly, when I looked at the spreads that we're generating, either here in the U.S. and comparing it to what we were able to do in Europe. They are very similar for this quarter. And in some quarters, we've seen that we were able to get slightly higher yields in the international markets and in other quarters, it has been the opposite.  So, there's really -- the way we are thinking about our portfolio is through the macro lens that we've identified what it is that is of interest to us. And the area that we, play in Europe is slightly narrower and it's a function of the product that's available than what we play in the U.S. In terms of retail versus industrial, as much as we would like to do more industrial, the pricing in this market keeps us a fairly constrained to that 10%. On a good quarter we are able to get to that 15%, 17% ZIP code.  But that's the composition of the industrial makeup of the overall acquisition. The rest of it is primarily retail. In terms of investment grade versus non-investment grade, we've said this in the past and I'll repeat it again. When we look at credit and we do our own analysis, we don't go out saying if it's a non-investment grade credit, we immediately disqualify it for consideration purposes.  If you look at what we were able to achieve in the third quarter, only 38% of what we did was investment-grade. So, we're very comfortable looking at non-investment grade. A non-investment grade does not necessarily mean sub-investment grade. It just means that it doesn't have a rating from one of the two major rating agencies and it might actually have a sub-investment grade rating, but we're very comfortable with that.  The last question that you had as a subpar to your first question was, in terms of there being an overlap with what we are inheriting from VEREIT, and there really isn't much, there are certainly certain, acquisition opportunities that we would find [Indiscernible] as a competitor. But they play in an area that we believe can truly be additive to our overall platform. And the high-rel side.  And we're still blast to inherit this, this team. And we're really looking forward to being able to completely integrate them into our acquisitions team and have them continue to pursue the transactions that they will pursuing and potentially not be constrained by the cost of capital. So, we genuinely believe that this is going to be an incremental to the acquisitions that we were able to achieve on a standalone basis. And then with respect to pricing, I think I address that through my spread comments so, Nate, I don't know if there's anything specific you want me to dive into. Thanks. Good questions, Greg. Look, I think the only area where I felt like we probably had non-triple net leases was on the GSA side of the equation on the office sub-portfolio that they had exposure to. Otherwise largely Greg, they -- these are triple-net leases. And if you think about how this particular portfolio was put together, we'll be able to give you a lot more color once we've got it all integrated, but I'd be very surprised to find gross leases -- preponderance of gross leases on the retail side and the industrial side of the equation.  Obviously industrial products, the landlord tends to be responsible for things like roof and structure, which one could argue is not a pure triple-net lease, but that is largely the same case with respect to our portfolio as well.  But the property maintenance is still the responsibility of the client, the end of the property taxes, the insurances -- insurance on those buildings are still the responsibility of the clients, so we still view those as predominantly net leases. So, with the separation of the office assets through the spend and the GSA leases, I think we are going to be largely a net-lease portfolio, very similar to the one that we have. So, I don't think that that's going to pose any major issues, Greg. Yeah. We've been doing about a $100 million to a $150 million. The audio we've gone past $200 million in dispositions on a standalone basis. We would like to inherit and really do a similar analysis on the portfolio that we are inheriting with VEREIT to see if that needs to be altered. A lot of the capital recycling that they were doing pre -merger was on the office side of the equation.  And so, I don't know if the number will dramatically increase beyond a linear extrapolation of going -- adding another $10 billion, $14 billion of assets. So maybe the 150 becomes 250, 275. But give us a quarter to digest this and filter it through our own asset management lens and we'd be able to come back to you with a lot more precise indication. But we don't suspect that it's going to be dramatically different from the run rate that we were doing on a standalone basis. Primarily UK and Spain, but we are certainly looking at other geographies that we have identified as core to our expansion objectives but it is primarily in the UK and Spain. As we start expanding, yes, you should expect that to go up. Sure. Look, what did we start this year with? It was right around $3.25 billion. Then we went up to $4.5 and now we're about $5. And we want to come out with numbers that we are -- we have a very high level of certainty associated with it. And as we start to develop our pipeline and visibility, we expect that number to go up. But we don't want to come out with a number that we feel like it's overly aggressive coming out of the gate.  So, this has been something that has been very important to us to be able to deliver to the market what we say we will deliver. And as such, you should consider this to be our initial guidance. And the hope is we can do better than that. And with time and as soon as we are in the next year, we hope to be able to get more precise around what the acquisition guidance will ultimately turn out to be. Hi Haendel. I'm here to alleviate any confusion Haendel. There are a lot of -- if you look at our top 10 clients and we have Carrefour that shows up there. And Carrefour is a non-rated Company. Yet if you were to look at its Balance Sheet and you were to look at its credit metrics, it would imply a very strong investment grade credit but that does not show up in the 38% investment-grade.  So, we've been playing in the area that we've identified coming out of the strategy sessions that we alluded to in the past. And we feel -- sorry, that's actually Sainsbury it's not Carrefour. Carrefour is actually rated triple B. So, when we come out and we share with you the actual investment-grade numbers, it is truly an investment grade rate rating by either S&P or Moody's.  But we play across the spectrum. But we are so focused in the area that we've identified as our area of growth that -- are we as focused in some of the higher-yielding product that our inherited team from VEREIT was focused on. Potentially not. Are we going to do everything that VEREIT was acquiring as a standalone Company? Probably not. But we are trying to create a team and we truly believe that team to be complementary to ours and now it's one team that is going to be able to play across the credit spectrum and be able to truly be an incremental source of acquisitions for us going forward. S o there'll be quarters where we do more than 38%, in fact, we've done up to 50%, 60% of investment-grade, and then there'll be other quarters where we don't. I don't want you to put too much rating to this headline number of how much investment-grade are we actually pursuing, because as I've said to you, that that's a by-product of our strategy, not what drives our strategy. Yeah, Caitlin, it's just not as developed -- and partly it's driven by being land constrained. You don't have as many freestanding triple-net opportunities in terms of various industries and various tenants being in that space. Obviously, the size of the actual market is 2x what we have here in the U.S. But the number of industries that mend itself to sort of this triple-net concept are a bit narrower. We've already talked about grocery as being one of the areas that we'd like to focus in on. Hold improvement is another area.  But it is very unusual to find some of the other industries that we're exposed to on the retail side, being available in mainland Europe. And that's really the point I'm trying to make, this is not the constraining factor because I think we put out some numbers, etc. sharing with you how much bigger the actual market is, the addressable market is in Europe that lends itself to net leasable investing. But it really is more of an -- it's just a narrower group of industries that play in that space. I hope so. I absolutely believe that with the newly expanded team that includes folks from what was VEREIT, we will be able to increase our run rate on the acquisition front, and we will be able to cover the credit spectrum a lot more precisely and acutely than we were able to do on a standalone basis, and that should result in not only higher sourcing, but getting more transactions over the finish line.  And that is absolutely one of the levers that we hope will play out for us. And based on everything that we've seen and based on getting to know our new colleagues better, I absolutely believe that is going to play out next year and beyond. So, but time will tell. But that is our expectation. Absolutely. It wasn't that we were passing on deals, Ronald, it was more along the lines of -- if you look at some of our industry concentration, they were starting to creep to double-digit ZIP codes and somewhat beyond that. And the complementary nature of what we are inheriting from VEREIT, I believe, helps us on a couple of industries.  If you look at a few of our largest industries like convenience stores and groceries, etc. All of those concentrations on a pro forma basis, it's actually going to come down. And so, it gives us more capacity to aggressively pursue opportunities that we are finding incredibly compelling to try to get over the finish line. So, it just gives us more capacity, that's one.  The second is, being a much larger Company, and this is a more recent phenomenon, I think 2 years ago, maybe a little bit longer than that, was the first time I heard of a billion-dollar sale-leaseback opportunity in our space, and it was on the retail side of the equation. And we've never heard of opportunities of that size. And even for us, if we had some prior exposure to the client doing a billion-dollar transaction, what's going to start to push the concentration risk issue, and now being 1.3 times, 1.4 times the size that we were -- it is less of an issue.  And the size of sale-leaseback opportunities that are now in play are billion-dollars opportunities. Now, we haven't really seen -- there have been announcements, but we haven't seen anything get over the finish line on that front. But that to us is exactly the type of transactions that we would like to be able to show up for and be able to do and be a single-point solution for some of our clients that we perhaps would not have been able to pursue in our previous version.  And so, I think that really is what we feel will be one of the biggest beneficiaries. And also, proactively to go to some of these larger companies and be able to say -- and then for large companies by definition, doing a $500 million sale-leaseback doesn't really move the needle for them much. And so, to be able to be a solution and provide multi-billion-dollar sale-leaseback opportunities for them, I think could be a lot more compelling.  And so those are the types of things that we'd be able to pursue post this closing that we obviously thought a lot about in the past and we have approached certain clients, but it was -- we were guided by what we were hearing in terms of what is really relevant for some of these folks. I think, time will tell, but it certainly creates the platform for us to now be able to pursue some of these transactions which we were not able to as aggressively pursue in the past. Ronald? We obviously gave you a couple of numbers when we came out with this. The point of coming out with a guidance at this point in the cycle, which is non-traditional for us, was largely driven by this acquisition that we did of VEREIT, and there was a lot of uncertainty around what does proforma Realty Income really look like post separation of the office assets.  And this was our attempt to sort of address that going forward. And so, in terms of the other ascension's like same-store rent and other inputs that go into the model, it is largely along the lines of what we've done in the past.  And so, you should -- and, of course, as we learn more about the portfolio that we've acquired and we look out into the future and we, more importantly, digest the 6 -- the $5 billion acquisition guidance that we have for this year, I think we'd be in a much better position to give you much more precise numbers on same-store growth etc. But for right now, you should assume it to be the 1% that we usually point to. Sure. Sorry. Are you asking us what is our filter of going into new markets? Is that the question Brent? Brent, I'll tell you very honestly, we did a lot of homework before we actually went into any particular market. We looked at transactions that have taken place in the past, we tried to understand the nuances of the structures, we considered the tax implications, a lot of the homework was done prior to us actually engaging with potential clients or the advisory community to start to pursue transaction.  So, I would say that we weren't overly surprised by the structure of the deals that we've been able to get over the finish line. The one thing that has surprised me personally, and I don't know if Neil and Mark are going to share in my comment, but it's the volume comment, I do believe that we have been able to create these relationships that have cemented to, and have translated into subsequent transactions much more quickly than what we had originally thought.  This is very much a relationship-driven market, which we anticipated but not to the extent that we've seen it play out. They are looking for long-term partners. They're looking for partners that are not in the market to flip out assets and that is right down the fairway for who we are and how we believe in generating value for our investors long-term.  The certainty of close to some is incredibly important, far more so than perhaps here in the U.S., it's not that certainty of close is not important, but they are much more price sensitive here in the U.S., than perhaps in continental Europe, as well as in the UK. So, reputation, size, scale. The fact that we do what we say does seem to be weighed a lot more significantly in all of Europe than what we had anticipated. So that's where the surprise came in, not in terms of the duration of the lease or the cap rates or the growth that we find embedded in these leases. A lot of that was known to us before we went into these markets. Sure. John, that's a good question. And if you're asking me, can we do positive 7% with next to no capital investments every quarter going forward? I think the answer is probably no. But I do think that over the last 8, 12 and even during the pandemic, the kind of releasing that we've been able to achieve without a bunch of capital investments is a testament to the quality of the portfolio that we have.  But much more importantly, it's a testament to the asset management team under the tutelage of Janine (ph.) that we are able to generate these numbers. And so, I feel like if you look at the trend and you look at what we've been able to do over the last 3, 4 years, we have generally achieved north of 100% releasing spreads.  And this by the way includes not just clients who are renewing an option, but also new clients that we are bringing in, into either empty buildings or buildings that are about to go empty. So, this is the complete picture of what we've been able to achieve. And that is one of the points that we've been trying to talk about that our business, on a normalized basis, is going to become a seven-year world business.  And a lot of value is either going to get created through this channel or not. And we've been anticipating this and building out our asset management team in anticipation of being able to generate the kind of results that we are posting on a quarter-by-quarter basis. So, we feel very good that we -- and we usually target above 100% every quarter and we've been able to do far better than that. And I'll leave it at that. It is certainly the latter. And if you're looking at grocery businesses here in the U.S., there's been a tremendous amount of compression that we've seen on the cap rate side of the equation. And I would say that the U.S. market has moved more towards the UK market than the other way around.  But there are differences to the lease structures, etc., and once again, I'm not going to go into the details, but what you see as that headline cap rate, you're seeing that they seem to be very close. There is some inter-quarter variability like I believe in the second quarter we had a slightly higher cap rate associated with international, and it was a function of the type of assets that we got, and the length of the lease terms that we were able to achieve or translated to higher cap rates.  But by and large, the spread which considers both the cap rate as well as the cost of capital, is very similar right now, very, very similar in both these markets. But I do think it's partly driven by -- we are playing in a much narrower industry spectrum in Europe. And we have been doing a lot more industrial here in the U.S. And it sorts of balances out and it yields a number that you see as the headline number posted on our supplemental. Thank you. It's a combination of all forms of development. We are doing takeout's, we are doing -- we're actually financing 100% of developments. The one common thread is that in the vast majority of the cases, there's a lease in hand. You might see that there's a retail asset wealth, I think on the retail side, it was 93% occupied.  And that's largely driven by repositioning that we're doing. And we don't quite have the lease in hand for that one particular unit. But otherwise, it's all built-to-suit. But we play across the spectrum, providing all of the development funding, as well as doing takeout. I'll let Christie answer that. Thank you. Sure. Look, I think as we get more and more comfortable with the strategy that we are currently executing, Michael, it gives us a lot more confidence to be able to say that this is a product that we're seeing. This is the translation rate on that product on the sourcing numbers. We feel very comfortable given the team and infrastructure we have in place that we are going to be able to accomplish the numbers that we've posted.  This year was a very interesting year for us because we had a very healthy pipeline. just like we do today come into the year. But it was post-pandemic and we didn't quite know how things are going to play out. But we felt very good about coming in and saying 3.25 billion, which we have since revised a couple of times.  And so, as we're getting more and more comfortable with the new markets that we're entering into, with the sourcing volumes that we're seeing, with the maturation of the team that we have in place, that's what is giving us the confidence. In the beginning, I assume, talk with my colleagues and we would earmark about 20% to 25% international, well today it's closer to 30%, 35% percent. We've built out the team in the international side.  We have a much more mature team and a fantastic team on the U.S side, and now we're going to inherit a group of veterans from this acquisition. So that's really the buildup that we've done internally and we feel fairly confident about to come out and say, look this year we're going to do north of 5 billion. we should be able to do that with the level of visibility and 1 year behind us now, in 2022. So that's how we came up with that number. I hope what you're saying is exactly right and a year from now we have a number that is far in excess of the $5 billion that we're coming out with Michael. What we don't want to do is have a particular number dictate our decision-making. We want to come out, and this is right along the lines of how we've operated the business. This is the largest acquisition volume number that we're going to be coming out with in our history. You're right, this is by design that we've created all these avenues and we should be increasing our guidance.  And perhaps there is a level of conservatism. But we would like nothing better to come in in February and revise our numbers and say, you know what, we've had a chance to revisit and be able to come in and with a high level of confidence, given all of these new strategies that we are putting a lot more effort into i.e. 1. higher yielding, 2. newer markets, 3. being able to have one quarter, 4. under our belt in Spain, 5. figuring out what we can or can't do there.  All of that hopefully will translate into higher numbers. But this is where we feel that we don't want to over-promise and under-deliver. And that's the reason why we're coming out with what we're coming out with. In the past, we have to consider partners when we were coming across these multi-billion-dollar sale-leaseback opportunities. But I think the need for that has diminished post this acquisition. We had inbounded from investors who wanted to participate on these one-off transactions, larger transactions outside of the realm of the public eye.  And we've largely stayed away from that because we felt like the transactions that we were actually seeing in the market that was near-term we could have handled all on our own. We haven't had to pursue a partnership very aggressively.  And I think the need for that has diminished even more so now, with this proforma for the very transaction, and I do believe that our willingness and desire to more actively pursue potential clients that we -- that we've talked about, that we might want to speak with and engage with is a lot higher today, given that the concentration issues that we could have entered into are somewhat muted now. And so, I do think that those types of conversations are going to be a little bit more front and center in terms of what we do. And we are going through it much more proactively. That's correct. So, you should assume that when we discussed the separation of the office assets, we were very clear with the market that we would have -- that we're going to pursue either a span out or a sale. And we did and where we concluded going through those to parallel path was that the spin is a far better option given where we were coming out on the sales side than not, which is precisely why we decided to choose to go down the spinning of the office assets. Putting a team that was very familiar with all of those assets, had been working very hard on assets managing those assets was, very capable of creating value longer term.  And what we -- the analysis that we went through was to say, okay, they have the thesis. It's a thesis that makes sense. There are some tailwinds in that particular sub sector. Given the success that they've been able to achieve over the last couple of years, you look at that and then you start to see what they can do with this portfolio going forward.  From an alternative perspective, this seems like the absolute right alternative for us to pursue despite the fact that selling the assets would have been an easier step for Realty Income to take. But we did pursue both those efforts in power loan and this is the path that on a risk-adjusted basis yielded the superior outcome for us, and that's the reason why we pursued it. Sure. Yeah, Josh, that's what we were -- sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt. Go ahead. That's what we've been adhering to Josh when we're talking about being able to have a team that is very capable of playing across the credit spectrum for a lack of better phrase, the higher-yielding assets, the lower-yielding assets and being able to cover that entire spectrum with a much broader team.  That is one of the biggest advantages that we are inheriting from -- through this acquisition. And there are other advantages of teammates that we are inheriting, not just on the acquisition front, but also on, when you look at some of the data analytics work that we're planning on doing, some of the process re-engineering work that we're doing.  They have a few very talented folks in their team that will become part of some of these opportunities that we are already building out and executing upon and be able to be tremendously additive and help us accelerate some of these opportunities to the finish line and create even more efficiency. So, it's really -- I am so proud of the team that we have inherited and it's [Indiscernible] 100 people that will really help us become a complete team. And of course, helped us absorb north of 3,000 properties, which is not a not a small foot. So, our payout ratio is in the high 70s today. We will always be the monthly dividend Company. It took us over 25 years to become part of the Dividend Aristocrat Index, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index. This is very core to our strategy going forward. And so, in years where we can grow 9.5% or 9.2% and the midpoint of the range that we've just shared with you, that will just continue to help us grow our dividends in the future.  And that is -- there will be no change to that strategy of annual growth on the dividend going forward. So really no change, Josh, but I just wanted to make sure given that you asked the question that I emphasize how important than core dividend growth is to Realty Income and nothing that we've done either recently or in the past is going to change that. Yeah. Linda, I'm not going to give you precise information. I think it is of strategic importance to us to not be that precise on growth by geography. I will tell you that 85% of our leases have contractual growth.  Either they are in the form of fixed growth, or they are in the form of CPI adjustments, or there are percentage rent clauses into the contract. It's one of those 3 variations that make up the growth profile. You can continue to underwrite to 1% same-store growth for our business going forward, and we will update you as and when warranted, but for right now, that is the assumption you should have for your models. No, no, no, please Christie, go ahead. I'll share the headline, but I'll let Christie speak to this point because she actually had the conversation along with Jonathan with the two-credit rate -- rating agencies. They were very supportive. When we in fact went back after our third quarter announcements and spoke with them, they were again, very complementary.  They solve the capital raising that we did and essentially front-loaded the funding of our acquisition pipeline. They continue to reaffirm their current stance of A minus A3 rating and a stable outlook. We feel like we're going to have 2 months of earnings associated with this closing. But all of the Balance Sheet, day 1, so the numbers are going to look a little bit off.  But on a proforma basis for annualized earnings, it's going to be right where we play and where the rating agencies are incredibly comfortable. So, I don't see us being put on any sort of a negative watch or what have you. We've tried to be very transparent, we've shared all the analysis with the rating agencies, and we feel very confident that they will continue to support us and maintain us at the current levels. Christie That's a good question, Chris. I don't know the answer to that. And it's very difficult to even enter into a hypothetical with the rating agencies about that particular scenario. It's an -- they tend to be a bit of a black box. And we didn't change our leverage profile that when we were on this way up. And this, I think lends credence to the comments you're making  Chris, but we can't expect that and truth be told, we are very happy with A - /A3 rating, I think. I don't know what the incremental benefit would be getting to an Aa2 rating, but I don't know if it's going to be as significant as going from triple B plus to A minus. But it's a good question and one that I think now that you've asked, we 'll post to the rating agencies to figure out how they're going to think about this. Yes, for us Chris, we've been very clear about what the limiting factor has been for us in Europe, we want to use domestic capital to finance as much of our acquisition as possible. But the limiting factor is always going to be the asset value.  And so that's one of the biggest advantages that we have is we can raise debt in any geography and in an environment where we see here in the U.S. as the rising 10-year U.S. Treasury not so much today, but expected. We could do a lot more on the unsecured side, assuming we continue to grow in the UK or in mainland Europe, as we grow out there.  But the constraining factor will always be what's on the left side of the Balance Sheet. And does it support, the raising or not. But could it be more levered there than here in the U.S.? Absolutely. That's one of the big advantages of why we did what we did. And on a fully consolidated basis, which is how we think about our business, we're very comfortable implementing that particular strategy. Of course, Chris. Thank you. Hi Spenser, we're going to stay away from speaking about specific transactions. We just don't do that. And then I'm going to be asked to remember of 400 properties that we acquired. What is the cap rate on the 388 property? And it's just going to be impossible. That's really the reason why we're staying away from being very precise about specific transactions and we tried to report it to you on a fully consolidated basis.  There is no doubt that we are able to get slightly higher yield on development projects than we would on assets that are ready for delivery. And that could range. It could range anywhere between -- and by the way, that has compressed, but it could range anywhere between 25 basis points to on the odd occasion, maybe 75 basis points, 80 basis points. It used to be north of 100 basis points not too long ago. But for us, we are a yield-driven business.  Every incremental yield is a positive for us Spenser. I do believe that in our supplement, we do provide that level of clarity, we do breakout what the development yields are, and so you should be able to track that as part of our overall acquisition volume, and how much of it is attributable to the development funding. And you will see that it's definitely higher than what we are actually acquiring assets and that's just a testament to our relationships and being able to balance out the overall portfolio. And that's the strategy we continue to play out. Thank you, everyone for coming, and we look forward to seeing a lot of you at Nerige. Goodbye."

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to Julie Hasselwander, Investor Relations at Realty Income.\nJulie Hasselwander: Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's second quarter operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Christie Kelly, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The Company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the Company's Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two-question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you would like to ask additional questions, you may re-enter the queue I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy.\nSumit Roy: Thanks, Julie. Welcome, everyone. Building enduring relationships is inherent to our purpose as an organization, and I would like to thank all of our stakeholders for their continued support. I would like to express my appreciation to all of my Realty Income colleagues who continue to relentlessly pursue our growth initiatives, while in the sustained remote work environment. We are pleased with the momentum across all facets of our business, which is reflected in our revised 2021 AFFO per share guidance of $3.53 to $3.59. Our increased guidance range represents an improvement of 2.7% at the midpoint compared to our prior range as well as an improvement of 5% at the midpoint versus last year and is a function of several tailwinds to our business: first, an increase to our 2021 acquisition volume guidance to approximately $4.5 billion; second, the continued improvement in rent collections from our theater clients; third, our well-priced capital markets activity since the start of June, which further positioned our balance sheet for continued growth; fourth, our active asset management activities, which resulted in occupancy of 98.5% at quarter-end and rent recapture rates in excess of 104% on lease expirations during the quarter; fifth, the overall quality of our portfolio, which has been curated, refined and underwritten over our 52-year history continues to perform throughout a variety of environments. We'll discuss each of these elements in greater detail shortly. Year-to-date, we have added approximately $2.2 billion of high-quality real estate to our portfolio, including $1.1 billion of new acquisitions in the second quarter. We continue to expand our platform as our size and scale remain key competitive advantages that translate directly into shareholder value. This quarter, we sourced more than $20 billion of acquisition opportunities, ultimately selecting and closing on less than 6%. On a total revenue basis, approximately 54% of the acquisitions made during the quarter are leased to investment-grade rated clients, which brings our total investment-grade client exposure to approximately 50%. The weighted average remaining lease term of the assets added to our portfolio during the quarter was 11.5 years. The largest industry represented in our second quarter acquisitions was UK grocery stores, and 7-Eleven remains our largest client. We remain well diversified as our portfolio consists of over 6,700 assets leased to approximately 630 clients who operate in 58 separate industries located in all 50 U.S. states, Puerto Rico and the UK And during the quarter, we continued to generate healthy investment spreads of approximately 172 basis points while acquiring, in our view, the highest quality product in the marketplace. The quality of our acquisitions is evident throughout the entire life cycle of our portfolio as we have consistently demonstrated favorable recapture rates on expiring leases while maintaining a healthy occupancy level throughout a variety of economic cycles. During the quarter, we re-leased 58 units, recapturing 104.7% of expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have executed over 3,700 re-leases or sales on expiring leases, recapturing over 100% of rent on these re-leased contracts. And occupancy at quarter-end was 98.5% based on property count. Our international investment activities continue to support our growth outlook, and our UK portfolio has now grown to over $2.7 billion. This quarter, the UK accounted for over 50% of the $1.1 billion of total acquisitions only. Year-to-date, we've added approximately $1 billion in high-quality real estate in the UK across 41 properties. And of the more than $21 billion in acquisitions opportunity that we sourced, approximately 31% is related to international markets. As we continue to expand our international platform, we will look for additional geographies that offer opportunities similar to that of the UK. We seek to acquire real estate in markets where opportunities are abundant. There is considerable demand for sale-leaseback transactions from industry-leading operators, and the local real estate can generate long-term IRRs in excess of our long-term cost of cabin. At this time, I'll pass it over to Christie, who will further discuss results from the quarter.\nChristie Kelly: Thank you, Sumit. We continue to prioritize a conservative balance sheet structure while procuring attractively priced capital. At quarter-end, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 5.4x or 5.3x on a pro forma basis, adjusting for the annualized impact of acquisitions and dispositions during the quarter. I would note that these ratios are before our $9.2 million share offering, which closed subsequent to quarter-end. Our fixed charge coverage ratio hit an all-time high for the second quarter in a row, coming in at 6.0x. And during the quarter, we raised over $457 million of equity primarily through our ATM program. Subsequent to quarter-end, we executed on two capital-raising activities to further enhance the strength of our balance sheet. In July, we raised approximately $594 million to an overnight equity offering. Proceeds were used to pay down short-term borrowings and support our active global investment pipeline. Additionally, in July, we issued our debut green bond, a \u00a3750 million multi-tranche denominated unsecured bond offering of 6 years and 12-year notes, priced at a combined all-in rate of 1.48% and a weighted average term of approximately 8.8 years. We're proud to be the first net lease REIT to demonstrate our commitment to our ESG initiatives with a green bond. This green bond creates further partnership opportunities with our clients to implement sustainable practices at the properties within our portfolio, providing support for environmentally conscious initiatives while achieving mutual sustainability goals. And we estimate that over 40% of the proceeds have already been allocated to existing green projects. More information about our green financing framework can be found on the corporate responsibility page of our website. This quarter, our business generated $0.88 of AFFO per share. And as Sumit mentioned, increasing greater rent collections are one of the drivers of our improved earnings outlook for 2021. In June, we collected approximately 51% of contractual theater rents. And in July, we collected 98.9% of our contractual theater rent. As a reminder, we own 79 total theater properties, which account for 5.4% of our annualized contractual rent. 42 of our theater assets are not on cash accounting, and we continue to recognize 100% of revenue on these assets on an accrual basis, consistent with our accounting treatment during the duration of the pandemic. The remaining 37 theater assets are currently on cash accounting, meaning we will not recognize any revenue associated with these clients until it has been received. These clients accounted for $34 million of annualized contractual rent or about $2.8 million of contractual rent per month. During the second quarter, we collected 38.3% of theater rent. The rent collections from June and July represented a significant improvement from prior periods. Our theater clients paid us 14% of contractual rent in the first quarter and an average of 31% in April and May. Assuming the pace of collections we recognize to the theater industry in July continues on through the remainder of the year, we would not expect to accrue any additional theater reserves going forward. We believe the increased rent collections reflect significant positive momentum in the theater industry. One after another, the latest blockbusters continue to demonstrate a return to normalcy for the theater industry. In mid-July, opening weekend of Black Widow brought in approximately $158 million in revenue globally, earning the record for the biggest opening weekend since the pandemic. We are cautiously optimistic the momentum we're seeing will continue while closely monitoring the COVID-19 variants. As a monthly dividend company, our mission is to invest in people and places to deliver dependable monthly dividends that increase over time. In July, we declared our 613th consecutive monthly dividends, and we have now increased the dividend 111x since our listing on the New York Stock Exchange in 1994. Since 1994, we have increased the dividend every year, growing dividends per share at a compound average annual growth rate of approximately 4.4%. And as a result, it's increasing the dividend every year for the last 25 consecutive years. We're proud to be a member of the exclusive S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which consists of only three REITs and 65 companies overall. Now I would like to hand our call back to Sumit.\nSumit Roy: Thank you, Christie. Before we open up the line for questions, I did want to provide a brief update on our pending merger with VEREIT. Our special shareholder meeting to approve the merger is scheduled for August 12, and we remain focused on the fourth quarter closing, subject to the satisfaction of all closing conditions. As I hope you can all appreciate, we are limited in any incremental information we can provide related to the merger beyond what has already been publicly disclosed. In conclusion, we are energized and pleased with the momentum across all areas of our business, which is reflected in our updated earnings guidance and increased growth projections for the year. As we have proven, with greater size comes enhanced prospects for growth, and we look forward to continuing to execute on these initiatives to ultimately deliver favorable full cycle AFFO per share growth with minimal volatility. At this time, I would like to open it up for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Nate Crossett with Berenberg.\nNate Crossett: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to just touch on activity in the quarter and kind of the outlook for the year. Maybe you could kind of give some color on the mix of the deal flow in the quarter and what you're seeing for the balance of the year? How is it weighting industrial versus retail? Are there a number of portfolio deals in there? And then, if you could just touch on what you're seeing in terms of pricing, both in the U.S. and the UK. And then also, I was curious here if you had looked at any transactions in Continental Europe yet.\nSumit Roy: Nate, thank you for your questions. So I hope to attempt to answer all of them, but I might miss a few. In terms of our volume, look, this is a continuation of a theme that we started the year with. And as you might recall, Nate, January, we had come out with a very robust pipeline. We've already sourced year-to-date more than $40 billion. And clearly, at the run rate that we've been able to achieve over the last three quarters and year-to-date, you can have a sense for the robustness of the pipeline. And I think the biggest surprise for us has been our -- the volume that we've been able to generate in the UK, some of which sort of translated to what we were able to accomplish in the second quarter. But even if you look year-to-date, it's representing about 40% of acquisitions. And the quality of the product that we're continuing to see, the relationships that we've been able to establish and grow in the UK during a very short period over the last two years is a testament to why we feel very comfortable with having increased our acquisition guidance by another $1.25 billion given that we are clipping away at $1 billion. So in terms of the pipeline, we are very happy with what we are seeing. We are very comfortable with the product that we are seeing. And I think this is -- this trend is going to continue. In terms of the makeup, you might have seen that depending on the quarter, anywhere between 25% to 30% of what we are acquiring is industrial. In the second quarter, 15% of overall acquisition was industrial, largely driven by about 35% industrial in the U.S. And we -- again, on the relationship front have been able to make a fair amount of progress, are seeing acquisition opportunities, sometimes before it even hits the market and being able to try to get some of these transactions over the finish line with the relationships that we have developed. And I think you should expect to see this 15% to 25% of our volume coming from the industrial side of the equation in terms of asset type continue over the next few quarters. In terms of cap rate, look, it's a very aggressive market. I think in previous calls, I've mentioned that cap rates have continued to compress, tighten whatever the right word is. And it's -- I think it's a testament to certainly the type of products that we are pursuing, but more so to the fact that net lease is a very unique way of investing in real estate that is very specific. And as such, for the type of products that we pursue, we have continued to see cap rates compress. And by the way, this is across the spectrum on the credit curve. It's not just on the investment-grade side. In fact, I'd argue on the investment-grade side, the compression has been more muted on a relative basis versus what we have seen on the high-yield side of the equation. So -- and that trend is continuing, and we saw that in the second quarter as well. I believe on the industrial front, it has continued to tighten, but it has -- the speed with which it's tightening has certainly slowed down. And we're seeing products on the industrial side for well-located assets in the high 3% cap rate, low 4% ZIP code to, on the rare occasion, high 4%, low 5% ZIP code depending on location. On the retail side, it's a similar story for high-quality assets with long lease terms, good growth, you're seeing in the low 4% to low 5% ZIP code. And then if you're willing to compromise on lease term or growth rates or what have you, perhaps credit, you can see transactions transacting in the mid-5% to low 7% ZIP code. But the stuff that one buys in the high 6s, low 7%, that has credit profiles, lease terms, et cetera, that obviously has a much higher risk profile associated to it. So I don't know if I got all your questions in, Nate, but please let me know if I missed something.\nNate Crossett: No, I think that's good. I'm just also curious, have you guys looked at any transactions on Continental Europe yet?\nSumit Roy: Yes. Thank you. We certainly have, and this is something that I have touched on in some of my previous calls. We just haven't been able to get some of these transactions over the finish line, but we are very close. The success that we have accomplished in the UK is one that we are trying to mimic in similar geographies with similar risk profiles. And with every day, every week that goes by, we are getting ever so close to being able to report to you additional markets that we've been able to add, which will become incremental source of growth for our business. But the direct answer to your question is, yes, we continue to look at opportunities, and we've come pretty close, but haven't been able to get them all the finish line as of the end of the second quarter.\nNate Crossett: Okay. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you.\nSumit Roy: Thanks, Nate.\nChristie Kelly: Thanks, Nate.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs.\nChristie Kelly: Hi, Caitlin.\nCaitlin Burrows: Hi, everyone. You historically mentioned one of the reasons the announced VEREIT is attractive is that by being larger, you can do some larger transactions without risking concentration increasing meaningfully. I think you referenced it again in the prepared remarks. So I also imagine that those kinds of deals take time to complete. I was wondering if you could comment on what the opportunity set is for something like that and how frequently you expect a deal of that nature could come up in the future. Is it something that could be like once a year or maybe never even happen? Just trying to understand how realistic something like that could be.\nSumit Roy: Yes. That's a very good question, Caitlin. Look, in terms of predicting what can happen in the future, some of what you see is publicly available. You have seen some large companies come out and say as part of their financing, sale leaseback is going to be a source of capital, and they've come out with multibillion dollar numbers. And those are the ones that are obvious, both you've seen that here in the U.S. and you've seen that in the UK as well, with some of the M&A work that happened and large sale-leaseback opportunities on the industrial front in one specific transaction in the UK and then there was a retail client here in the U.S. that has come out with something like that. But I think what we would like to be able to change is to proactively go and be a solution for transactions that may not be in the public eye. And given the fact that we will have the size and scale, it is more difficult for me to predict as to how many of those opportunities can we create. When you talk to large companies and you go in there and you say, \"Oh, we can do -- we can take $1 billion of your real estate off the balance sheet.\" Sometimes that's not meaningful enough to engage in a conversation. I mean, here, we are talking about $70 million, $80 million, $100 million companies, and that sort of capital doesn't really move the needle for them. And so what we are very optimistic about is to be able to use our pro forma on larger scale to be able to have more aggressively some of these conversations that we started a few years ago. And the feedback that we had received was, oh, yes, thanks a lot, just not big enough for us to be meaningful to engage. And so I think those conversations, we hope to get over the finish line and create more opportunities. But Catlin, I can't sit here and tell you that there will be one or two of those transactions per year. I think we have to view those where we are generating those transactions on our own as opportunistic. And time will tell as to how many of those we can sort of get over the finish line. But even if you were to just look at the ones that are not opportunistic, the ones that are part of M&A capital strategies, you're starting to see a lot more today than you ever did in the past. And I've just referenced two transactions in the recent, call it, five months, six months period. I'm not trying to suggest that you should extrapolate that. But those types of transactions didn't see the light of day three years ago, four years ago. And so that's what gives us confidence that being a larger company will allow us to more proactively take advantage of these opportunities that present themselves and be that one-stop shop, which even with our current size, we sometimes fall short.\nCaitlin Burrows: Got it. And then maybe just talking about on the tenant side, retailer bankruptcies have been pretty limited this year. Could you give some detail on the status of your watch list or maybe just more generally, your understanding of how your tenants are doing today?\nSumit Roy: Yes. Our watch list stands right around 4% currently, Caitlin. And again, what gives us a lot of confidence is if you look at our collection numbers in July, which we shared with you, it's about 99%. And some could argue over that 99% may have built in a lot of abatements and a reduction in rent that you might have passed on to clients. And I just want to make sure that we make it very clear that it doesn't. I mean, if you look at the numbers, and we've put this out publicly, if you look at the abatement number, it's about slightly more than $1 million on $1.6 billion of rent. So it's about 90 basis points is what we have -- not even actually, it's a lot less than that, what we have updated, and these are largely to smaller operators. So when we are collecting above 99% on rent that has largely not been abated, it's very similar to what we had pre-COVID that should be a testament to the credit profile of the tenants that we are exposed to, and that is by design. So we feel very good about where we are and especially with every month that goes by this continued optimism that we have in our ability to get back to pre-pandemic levels without having to give abatements, I think, is a testament to the credit quality of our operators.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Katie McConnell with Citi.\nKatie McConnell: Now that your theater collections are becoming much more stabilized, can you talk about your approach to converting cash basis tenants back to the accrual method eventually and how we should think about potential timing of that?\nSumit Roy: Sure. Katie, if you wouldn't mind, I'll have Christie talk to that.\nChristie Kelly: Certainly. Thanks, Sumit. Thanks, Katie. So essentially, Katie, we have very positive momentum as we've discussed in our theater industry collections. And as we look forward towards the end of the year, there are a couple of things that we're really watching. And first is going to be collection experience, and that is sustained and in accordance with our contractual and any deferral agreement. Second is in relation to that experience going into not only the third quarter but the fourth quarter to ensure that we have consistency, that we maintain momentum on collections and that we're able to report the 98% to 100% collections that we're expecting going forward with no additional reserves. And so CBD, we're booking and looking and reviewing as part of our routine every week, every month, and we'll have more to report after the third quarter.\nKatie McConnell: Okay. Got it. And then could you discuss how your G&A needs could change in international markets of the UK portfolio continues to grow and as you start thinking about entering some new markets?\nSumit Roy: Sure. So Katie, part of the strategy we had was to use a combination of folks that we had in-house and some companies that we felt very comfortable with outsourcing to as third-party providers for services that we needed. And obviously, if we -- as our portfolio has grown and now it's about $2.7 billion in the UK, a lot of these third-party providers provide services that we can accommodate internally at margins that are superior to what we were getting outsourcing those particular functions. So as we have grown, we are bringing in-house more and more of these services. One of the other things that we are trying to look at and consider is as we grow into additional markets, and we believe that to be a matter of time, where is it that we should be domiciled, et cetera? And that work has -- we've made a tremendous amount of progress on that front as well. So before we bring in some of these functions in-house, we wanted to make sure that we were structured appropriately to accommodate our continued growth in Europe. And so there will be more to come on that front, but we will certainly be able to create synergies by bringing some of these outsourced services in-house. And it's largely going to be a function of where we ultimately decide to be headquartered to help support the European expansion. And -- but those discussions are ongoing, and we'll have more to report on that front as and when we establish our operations, et cetera.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank.\nGreg McGinniss: I want to talk about UK a little bit more. So the investment spread there is wider than what you've been able to achieve in the U.S. Is that just a function of plus competition? And then what are your thoughts on increasing your investment focus on that market since you started investing there, maybe targeting a higher percentage of UK versus U.S. asset than initially thought of?\nSumit Roy: So Greg, part of it was, if you looked at the first quarter, we were in the low 5s in terms of what we were able to accomplish in the UK It's a function of the asset types that we are able to get over the finish line as well as some of the operators that we pursue, the lease term, et cetera, et cetera. And we were hoping to actually close on a few transactions that were slightly more higher yielding in the first quarter that slipped into the second quarter, which is the primary reason for this higher cap rate. In terms of competition, every day that goes by, I'm exaggerating, of course, the competition in the UK is increasing. I think people have started to realize that, that is a market that affords good risk-adjusted returns. And so I don't see competition as being the dictate as to whether we should increase, decrease the quantum of transactions that we pursue in the UK. We have a very defined -- clearly defined strategy in the UK And if there are transactions that we see, if they meet those particular criteria, we pursue it and we pursue it aggressively. And I think that's what's going to dictate the amount of volume. Now clearly, the volume has increased, and part of it is because it took us a while to establish ourselves, establish our name and establish those -- the reputation that we have and the relationships that we've built. But if there are opportunities and more opportunities to -- if the volume of opportunities increase, you can totally see us increasing the amount of acquisitions that we get over the finish line in the UK But we're going to be very true to our strategy that we laid out, and that's not to say it's a static strategy that doesn't get looked at, and it doesn't get added to or subtracted from. It's just something that we spend a lot of time first figuring out what is the right product to pursue and then react to that strategy that we have thoughtfully laid out for ourselves. So it could be volume of acquisitions increase as more and more products start to come to the fourth. For sure, it could. Is competition increasing? Yes. But I think the way for us to think about our international strategy is to think in terms of newer markets to continue to add to the volume of overall acquisitions, not necessarily do more in a given location.\nGreg McGinniss: Okay. And then to help us better understand the hurdles to additional investment opportunities in Europe, what enables you to more quickly accomplish the goal of finding significant investment opportunities in the UK getting those deals across the finish line in Continental Europe?\nSumit Roy: Part of it was pricing. It got so aggressive. These were transactions that met a lot of our strategic objectives that we had laid out. But there's just a lot of capital that is chasing these deals, like I said. And when it got to a point where it didn't make economic sense for us to continue to pursue, we backed away. And I think that has largely been the reason why we haven't sort of gotten into some of the other markets. But I will say that as we have become more visible in given geographies, just like we did in the UK, people are getting familiar with our names. And so there might have been transactions that we might not have seen two years ago or 1.5 years ago, that we are now seeing because people understand that we -- they understand what we were able to do in the UK That reputation has translated to Continental Europe. And the fact that we have pursued a few transactions has obviously led credence to our ability and our desire to grow our portfolio in those particular markets. And I think that is translating into the flow that you need to get into to establish a particular market. And so we are very optimistic that over the next few quarters, you will start to see us expand into other markets outside of the UK\nGreg McGinniss: All right. If you won't mind, just a quick follow-up there based on that response. Are you -- is it fair to say that you're seeing more competition than in Continental Europe versus the UK?\nSumit Roy: I wouldn't say it's more than in the UK What I would say is the pricing could be the folks -- the capital markets environment in Continental Europe versus the UK is different. And that translates into a more aggressive pricing environment at times. And so, we're going to be very disciplined at, Greg. And if we don't feel like it makes sense on a risk-adjusted basis, we are not going to pursue it just for the sake of expanding into new markets. But having said all of that, I'm very optimistic about being able to add to our UK expansion in the near term.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho.\nHaendel St. Juste: Just wanted to go back to the UK cap rates, the jump that we saw there in the past quarter. I'm curious did you enter any new markets within the UK, like, say, Scotland? And then maybe can you comment on what the expectation should be near term? Or how are you thinking about cap rates in the UK near term? Will it be closer to 5% like last quarter or 6% perhaps closer to the new norm?\nSumit Roy: Yes. So Haendel, when you say UK, we've been looking at transactions in Scotland, Wales and England. Those are the three countries that we focused on. So the fact that we have closed on a particular transaction, and I don't recall off the top of my head whether we did or we didn't, is not new. We -- from the time we've gone into the UK, we've been looking at all three countries -- not Northern Island yet, just to be clear. The cap rate is really a function of what gets closed in a given quarter handle. As you know, the industrial market is trade at lower cap rates, especially if it has the lease term, et cetera. And it's a similar story on the retail front as well. Perhaps it's slightly higher than the industrial side, but not that much higher, especially if it has lease term and it's with one of the top three operators, top four operators on the grocery side of the business. So it really is a question of whether it's industrial or retail. Within retail, is it grocery or home improvement? What is the duration of the lease term? All of that goes into the mix to define what the cap rate is. And yes, within the three countries as well, there is a slight discrepancy in terms of cap rates, what a similar asset would trade in Scotland versus in England. But it's a function of all of those various factors that go into what the cap rate is for a given transaction. And we have, like I have said before, a very clearly defined strategy. And depending on what gets over the finish line that translates to the cap rates that we've shared. So this particular quarter, it was about 6%. And in the first quarter, it was in the low 5s. So it blended out to -- in the mid to high 5% cap rates, which I think is what one should expect going forward.\nHaendel St. Juste: Got it. Got it. Appreciate that. And one more, just again, fully understanding there's a lot of sensitivity regarding matters pertaining to the merger, the pending merger with VEREIT. But there's been some confusion amongst the number of users we talked to you about the 10% accretion target you outlined for the merger. So maybe can you just clarify for us the 10% accretion. Is that before or after the office portfolio spin-off that you're doing concurrently with the merger?\nSumit Roy: Yes. The 10% is the overall system accretion. It is inclusive of the office assets. It's inclusive of the entire company. And that's the extent of the comments I'm going to make. I think you can look at the investor deck that we had put out that walks you through the mechanics of what that 10% really entails. But if you look at these two companies and you have one company buying another company, what is the accretion, it's 10%. That's how you should think about it, actually, not 10%.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley.\nRonald Kamdem: Just two quick ones for me. The first, I think you talked about historically in the past, given how well the portfolio did during COVID that there was potential to look at maybe higher-yielding, slightly higher risk assets on the acquisition side. Just curious what -- is that still something that you guys are thinking about in bringing the strategy? Is that still something that's being contemplated?\nSumit Roy: Ronald, yes, it's absolutely part and parcel of our strategy. We play across the risk spectrum and the credit spectrum. And so just because something is high yielding doesn't necessarily always mean that it has risk associated with it, for which you are not getting paid. But we don't find those very often. I'll also go ahead and say that. And -- but if we do, and it just happens to have a high 6% cap rate associated with it, and the fact that we have certain competencies on our asset management and leasing side of the equation, which we believe are true competencies that are -- that make us based on some of the results that we've shared, we feel a lot better about being able to pursue those opportunities. And the more assets that we reposition, et cetera, the better we are able to underwrite some of the risk that's inherent in the high-yielding opportunities that we see. And so as we continue to build on our competency of repositioning assets and being able to generate spreads that are north of what the existing spreads were, I think we will look at more higher-yielding opportunities. But it's -- they don't come very often, but it's certainly part of our strategy, Ronald.\nRonald Kamdem: And then the second question was just going back, I think you talked a little bit about cap rate compression in the sort of both in the industrial as well as in the retail. So maybe just can you, again, compare and contrast. Obviously, industrial has been sort of very competitive. It sounds like the cap rate compression has moderated relative to the retail. Just curious if those comments are captured accurate, if you can provide a little bit more color there?\nSumit Roy: So Ronald, it's a long -- the range of cap rates that I've shared with you that we are seeing in the market on assets that we are pursuing, I do think that where we have seen compression, the retail assets continue to compress more today than the industrial assets. But we hear stories of certain transactions that happen at cap rates that we've never seen before, but I would consider that to be one-off. But it is a question of a lot of capital chasing the same set of products that we find ourselves interested in. And that has resulted in the environment that we find ourselves. Having said all of that, we are still generating -- in the second quarter, we generated over 170 basis points in spread, which is better than our average spread over the duration of our history of acquiring assets. So even in this environment, we are very competitive and we are able to grow our portfolio and generate above average spreads. So we feel very good about where we are. But I don't think that it's a sustainable environment where cap rates continue to compress, especially if it's -- funny I say this, but the 10 year trading in the 1 15, 1 16 ZIP Code, but where the expectation is that inflation should come in and interest rates at some point will start to go back up, I think that's going to be the floor for this continued compression. But we are starting to see some level of stabilization, certainly on the industrial side.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brent Dilts with UBS.\nBrent Dilts: In the transaction market for theater assets, are you seeing any buyers up here yet or any sellers actively marketing properties as rent collection rates improve? We saw the recent AMC deal for the two Pacific theater properties, but just wondering more broadly what you're seeing in the market there?\nSumit Roy: I think, Brent, what AMC was able to do is largely along the lines of what their CEO has suggested to the market that they now are sitting on plenty of capital where they can play offense and where they see opportunities with assets that are well located but the operator is no longer there or is in a distressed situation, they're going out and buying out the operators. And that I think is very prudent. We haven't been in the market trying to sell our assets or anything like that. We had a thesis that we have shared with you and with the market about the theater business as an industry. We've also shared with you that the assets that we believe we have tend to be very well located and in terms of performance are in the top two quartiles a vast majority of our assets. And so our expectations have always been that this business will come back and we will start to collect 100% of our rent, and that our operators will start to pay back some of the deferred rent, which in one case has already started. But I did see some news around assets having traded and I think it might have been one of our peer companies that sold a couple of layer assets. But we really are not playing in the market rent. For us, it was more of about in the off chance that we do get some of these assets back, how can we reposition them. And I think I've made comments in the past around our confidence in being able to reposition some of these assets just given their location and given the demand for alternative use. But we haven't been looking to buy more assets nor have we been looking to sell any of our theater asset. So can't really comment on that outside of what I saw in the press.\nBrent Dilts: And then just a clarification maybe on the guidance for this year. Does the revision for your guidance -- could you just clarify what is assumed on the recovery of deferred rents from the theater tenants versus your prior assumptions?\nSumit Roy: We haven't changed -- yes, go ahead, Christie\u2026\nChristie Kelly: I was just going to say that as it relates to the guidance, Brent, essentially, we're expecting as we move forward that we continue to incur and experienced positive rent collections similar to the trends that we've been seeing increased through the second quarter and consistent with the experience in July.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Linda Tsai with Jefferies.\nLinda Tsai: I apologize, another cap rate question, but in terms of the larger sale leasebacks for retail and industrial. How do the cap rates on these deals compare to your regular one-off acquisitions?\nSumit Roy: Well, we haven't really seen one of those larger transactions here in the US actually transact, so I can't really comment on that, Linda. But traditionally, we had always seen a discount on the portfolio transactions vis-a-vis what you see in the one-off market. And my expectation would be that in order to facilitate multibillion dollar sale leaseback transactions that that discount will continue to be there vis-a-vis the one-off markets, but time will tell. We certainly have seen a compression on that discount but I believe that there will have to be a discount in order for an institutional buyer like ourselves to continue to engage. Otherwise, what's the difference? We could pick these assets off in the one-off market and we certainly have the infrastructure to do that. So that's my belief.\nLinda Tsai: And then you discussed before the superior cost of capital in the UK versus the US. What's the differential like currently and do you view it as sustainable?\nSumit Roy: So I mean, on the cost of equity, obviously, it's the same. It's really the cost of debt that we see a major difference. You saw what we were able to do on the green bond issuance. I think it priced out at about 1.48% all in. If we were to do a similar issuance here in the US, I think the delta would be 30 to 40 basis points, maybe even larger. Now obviously, the environment today is very different from when we went to the market. But nevertheless, I saw a quote not just too long ago on a 10 year unsecured bond, it was 1.95, 1.98. And we got August, a nine year weighted average on the bond issuance that we just did, and that was at 1.48. So yes, that 50 basis point delta continues to be there. And that's really the advantage that we have, that we have assets, that could be financed with capital being raised locally. And so that's where the cost of capital advantage comes in.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Massocca with Ladenburg Thalmann.\nJohn Massocca: So I guess touching back on the industrial investment platform again. And did I hear you correctly, it seems like at the beginning of the call, you were kind of indicating that maybe you're looking to -- I know you've historically always been in industrial, but maybe you can further grow that platform? And if so, I mean, how has your kind of underwriting on industrial assets changed over the years? I mean, maybe this is a misconception on my part, but I've always kind of thought of your industrial investments being primarily kind of high investment grade rated tenants on long kind of lease term. Has there been any push into areas that maybe have shorter duration leases, maybe some of the more, I guess, less name brand tenants in an industrial asset? Just anything on that front and how that platform is evolving.\nSumit Roy: So John, I think we've been asked this question around our industrial portfolio and what is the allocation that we would like to see in an optimal portfolio, and we've said circa 20%. Today, we are right around 12%. So our desire is to grow that asset type to the 20% ZIP code. So I don't think your question is around why are we doing it. I think you prefaced your question by saying we have been in industrial. So I think that hasn't changed. Obviously, as we have underwritten industrial assets now for over 10 years, I think our first investment was in 2010, 2011 time frame We have evolved in terms of being able to take on assets that may have only nine years left on a lease rather than what we used to feel comfortable around doing 10 years ago, which was 15 year leases or 20 year leases and potentially doing it only through the sale leaseback channels rather than providing capital for takeouts, et cetera. And so clearly, on the lease term, we are very comfortable taking on high single digit, mid single digit lease terms, if we can get very comfortable with the market and inherent rent and what the price per square feet is for given assets and what the market can looks like on future rental growth, as well as alternative tenants that could step in. And if that allows us to pursue some transactions, we will absolutely do that. We are very proud of our industrial asset management team. And we share with you the renewals and the releases that we have on a blended basis. And those types of numbers have continued to give us confidence to grow our business and to grow our platform, and to bring in more and more people along with the team that we already have. That's very comfortable playing across the lease term, playing across the credit spectrum, et cetera. Having said all of that, we are still predominantly investment grade. But we are very comfortable playing across the credit spectrum on the industrial side, if we believe it's well located with good real estate metrics associated with it.\nJohn Massocca: And then on the balance sheet side, obviously, the UK debt issuance was a green bond. I guess maybe kind of both in the UK and in the US, what's the opportunity set there for more kind of green bond issuance? And I guess what are the advantages essentially from a pricing perspective versus the non-green bond.\nSumit Roy: Christie?\nChristie Kelly: Essentially, one of the aspects of green bond is there is some slight, if you will, favorability associated with the overall rate. I mean based on our research and tracking, it's about 10 basis points, but it's really more than that. It's really about making a statement as it relates to our ESG initiatives and as well, putting a framework out there that really allows us to partner with our clients and doing the right thing as we focus on reducing our carbon footprint. And as we go forward, yes, green bond is something that we're interested in. One of the things that we had talked about in our prepared remarks is the fact that the bond that we executed have about 40% fulfillment as it relates to real estate that meets the criteria. We're focused on completing that, not only with acquisitions that we execute in the UK and eventually potentially on the continent, but also in the US. And we think it's a great vehicle for us to move forward with not only from a liability management perspective and driving competitive weighted average cost of capital, but as I mentioned before, just doing the right thing, allowing us to partner in the right way with our clients to make a difference.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Lucas with Capital One Securities.\nChris Lucas: So Sumit, just a couple of quick questions for you. Just on the merger with VEREIT. Can you just give us a sense of what are the hurdles left to get through and maybe the expected timing? You mentioned the shareholder vote next week. I'm assuming there's other things that need to get done that push the expected completion date sometime fourth quarter.\nSumit Roy: So Chris, I'm very limited and constrained in terms of what I can talk about with respect to the merger. All I can tell you is we are right on schedule. One of the biggest hurdles, as you said, is our shareholder vote next week on the 12 -- well, it's on August 12. And then we -- if you look at our agreements, et cetera, I think you'll see a couple of other conditions that have been laid out, but we feel very comfortable, and we are on schedule so far. So I think by the third quarter, we'll have a lot more to share with you. And so if I can just ask you to be a bit patient, a bit more patient, I'd appreciate it.\nChris Lucas: And then I guess just on the significant bump in acquisition guidance. Is there any large portfolio transactions that are embedded in that number that we should be aware of?\nSumit Roy: No, Chris. Nothing out of the ordinary. It's just a very healthy pipeline. It's exactly the type of product that you would expect Realty Income to pursue. So no large portfolios are part of this guidance.\nChris Lucas: And then last question and maybe for Christie, just on the significant ramp in theater rent collections. Was there anything in your relationship with them that sort of drove that or was it just as random as they just decided to pay you in July\u2026\nChristie Kelly: As you can imagine, Chris, we're in close contact with our theater clients and have been so since the beginning of the pandemic and even beyond that. But as you've seen, I mean their liquidity position has improved significantly. Essentially, all theaters are open. And with that, we've had some great results at the box office. So that's all translating to improved collections together with the fact that we hold essentially the best assets. And so with that, we're working in partnership. We expect to be paid in full, as Sumit said, from the abatement activity, et cetera, very immaterial and nothing in relation to our theater clients. And moving forward, we are continuing to partner. We're focused on getting paid in full and that's the manner in which we're going forward. So nothing magic [Multiple Speakers]\u2026\nChris Lucas: Last question for me, just on the deferral repayment schedule. Have you guys outlined sort of what the cadence of that is expected to be?\nChristie Kelly: I think we've talked about it in general, Chris. And suffice it to say that as it relates to deferrals, we're not at liberty to talk about any one client. But overall, I can explain to you our strategy and essentially, it's to get paid back in full here in the near term. Essentially, any of our deferral arrangements are spanning, call it, a year to 18 months out. We're expected to get paid back in terms of average deferral period within seven months. And as a matter of fact, some of our clients are paying us back early. And so overall, great job done by the team and again, good partnership with our clients.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Spenser Allaway with Green Street.\nSpenser Allaway: As it relates to dispositions in the quarter, most of your asset sales were vacant assets. So can you just comment on the market for these assets? And would you say it's harder to offload your vacant assets today than it was pre-COVID, just given the additional headwinds in the market?\nSumit Roy: Spencer, actually, again, it's the exact opposite. If you look at the second quarter and you look at the resolutions, we were able to pick up 50 basis points essentially from where we were in terms of occupancy at the end of the first quarter versus the second quarter from 98% to 98.5%. It's largely a testament to what we were able to do on the asset sales side and these are vacant asset sales. I think we had close to 40 resolutions on that front. And then if you look at what the return profile has been, it continues to be year-to-date in that 8% plus unlevered returns. So I think it again goes back to where we buy assets, how fungible are these assets. If not for retenanting purposes to sell it vacant and still be able to capture returns that are well in excess of our long-term weighted average cost of capital. So we've been very successful and part of it is a testament to the team that we have in place. And we haven't seen any drop off, in fact, during this COVID-related downturn that we are coming out of. And I would go so far as to say that our speed, our ability to execute more transactions has continued to increase quarter-over-quarter. So that's the reason why we are so proud of being able to get to 98.5% despite suffering NPC's bankruptcy in the fourth quarter where we were handed back 70 odd assets, and we were able to get right back to that 98.5% ZIP code within two quarters. So we feel very good about our team and our ability to continue to take advantage of the market.\nSpenser Allaway: And it looks like you sold at least one office asset. Can you just comment on that property type in the market for those assets right now, and especially for assets with low lease term?\nSumit Roy: I don't want to speak to specifics, Spencer, because we have NDAs, et cetera. But rest assured that was an asset where if we had discussions with the tenant and it was deemed better to sell it back and move forward. And again, on that particular asset, our overall return profile was well in advance of what we captured for the second quarter. So we feel very good about those opportunistic sales. There is no secret. We've already mentioned that we are not in -- I mean, office is not a long term asset type that we want to be exposed to. And we get these one-off opportunities to take advantage of them.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Elvis Rodriguez with Bank of America.\nElvis Rodriguez: Just a quick one on strategy. Sumit, as you think about acquiring these larger portfolios and the sale leaseback deals, how do you think about like the assets you want to keep versus the assets you want to shed in terms of spinning them out versus an outright sale?\nSumit Roy: So Alves, that's part of what we do across our portfolio pretty much on a daily basis. It's not just when we are buying large sale leaseback transactions. I mean, obviously, we are somewhat constrained being a REIT. You have holding period requirements, et cetera. But in the past, when we have done large sale leasebacks or larger sale leasebacks, there were some assets that we bought into our TRS primarily with the intent of managing our exposure to the tenant. And so that has always been part of our strategy and will continue to be part of our strategy going forward. So nothing new there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank.\nGreg McGinniss: Just a quick follow-up again. Just a couple of quick follow-ups here. So there was a lot of movement on the convenience store side of things this quarter with 7-Elevens, Circle-K, [BWA] and GPM kind of shifting around top tenant list. Just curious there were maybe some trades between those tenants, that was impacting that. And then in terms of increasing exposure to 7-Eleven, was that a deal that maybe you may not have pursued without the pending VEREIT merger or are you comfortable with 6% exposure to certain tenants?\nSumit Roy: Well, not too long ago, we had 7% exposure to Walgreens. And now as you noticed, Greg, that has, over time, dwindled down to 7.5%. The biggest movement on the 7-Eleven transaction was that they closed on their Speedway transaction. And you might recall, we used to have, I don't know how many assets, but we were exposed to Speedway. And so once they closed on it, it's obviously now under 7-Eleven and that's what shows an increase in the 7-Eleven tenant client exposure. Then you might have noticed that on the Circle K, Couche-Tard side that went lower, and it's primarily because they sold some of the assets that were our assets to KC. And so that's the reason for some of the Couche-Tard concentration to be reduced from what you had seen in the previous quarter. So that's really what's happening. It's not us going out and doing transactions or what have you. Having said that, if transactions were to be available, we would absolutely pursue it. And we are very comfortable with individual clients representing 6%, 7%, not across the board but for certain clients, we are absolutely very comfortable with that. And 7-Eleven is definitely one of them.\nGreg McGinniss: And just a final one for me kind of following up on Spencer's question on dispositions. So past quarter was, I guess, the largest number of vacant dispositions in years. Was that just due to the NPC vacancies or is there any other particular tenant or industry type for those assets? And then any color you can provide on the re-leasing or repositioning attempts on those assets would be appreciated as well, because obviously, you showed success in the other re-leasing numbers this quarter.\nSumit Roy: So Greg, this is part of our asset management strategy. Obviously, we are very comfortable holding on to assets. It's not like we are trying to manage to an occupancy number. But there is an analysis that we go through figuring out what is the holding cost, what is the re-leasing scenario look like, how long is that going to take, is there going to be capital contribution, are we better off selling it for whatever it is that we are able to get, what's the return profile looks like in a re-leasing scenario versus a sale scenario today. And once you look at the mix, you pursue a particular strategy, and that's largely what's driving the decision making process. And what we found was, yes, that some of the assets that we sold actually were the bankrupt assets that we got back from NPC. They were in high demand but not for re-lease. They were in high demand with folks that wanted to buy these assets outright. And when you look at the return profile, it was superior to us holding it and trying to find a new client that could step into those assets. Having said that, there are some assets that we actually re-leased to new clients as well. So it's a combination of strategies that we execute but the underlying premise and the goal has always been what is going to maximize our returns and whatever that answer is that it's selling it vacant versus finding a new tenant, that's dictated by this return profile.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income's conference call. I would now like to turn the call over to Sumit Roy for concluding remarks.\nSumit Roy: Well, thank you very much, and I look forward to coming back to you shortly. Bye-bye.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation. This concludes Realty Income Second Quarter 2021 Operating Results Conference Call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Christie Kelly",
            "content": "Thank you, Sumit. We continue to prioritize a conservative balance sheet structure while procuring attractively priced capital. At quarter-end, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 5.4x or 5.3x on a pro forma basis, adjusting for the annualized impact of acquisitions and dispositions during the quarter. I would note that these ratios are before our $9.2 million share offering, which closed subsequent to quarter-end. Our fixed charge coverage ratio hit an all-time high for the second quarter in a row, coming in at 6.0x. And during the quarter, we raised over $457 million of equity primarily through our ATM program. Subsequent to quarter-end, we executed on two capital-raising activities to further enhance the strength of our balance sheet. In July, we raised approximately $594 million to an overnight equity offering. Proceeds were used to pay down short-term borrowings and support our active global investment pipeline. Additionally, in July, we issued our debut green bond, a \u00a3750 million multi-tranche denominated unsecured bond offering of 6 years and 12-year notes, priced at a combined all-in rate of 1.48% and a weighted average term of approximately 8.8 years. We're proud to be the first net lease REIT to demonstrate our commitment to our ESG initiatives with a green bond. This green bond creates further partnership opportunities with our clients to implement sustainable practices at the properties within our portfolio, providing support for environmentally conscious initiatives while achieving mutual sustainability goals. And we estimate that over 40% of the proceeds have already been allocated to existing green projects. More information about our green financing framework can be found on the corporate responsibility page of our website. This quarter, our business generated $0.88 of AFFO per share. And as Sumit mentioned, increasing greater rent collections are one of the drivers of our improved earnings outlook for 2021. In June, we collected approximately 51% of contractual theater rents. And in July, we collected 98.9% of our contractual theater rent. As a reminder, we own 79 total theater properties, which account for 5.4% of our annualized contractual rent. 42 of our theater assets are not on cash accounting, and we continue to recognize 100% of revenue on these assets on an accrual basis, consistent with our accounting treatment during the duration of the pandemic. The remaining 37 theater assets are currently on cash accounting, meaning we will not recognize any revenue associated with these clients until it has been received. These clients accounted for $34 million of annualized contractual rent or about $2.8 million of contractual rent per month. During the second quarter, we collected 38.3% of theater rent. The rent collections from June and July represented a significant improvement from prior periods. Our theater clients paid us 14% of contractual rent in the first quarter and an average of 31% in April and May. Assuming the pace of collections we recognize to the theater industry in July continues on through the remainder of the year, we would not expect to accrue any additional theater reserves going forward. We believe the increased rent collections reflect significant positive momentum in the theater industry. One after another, the latest blockbusters continue to demonstrate a return to normalcy for the theater industry. In mid-July, opening weekend of Black Widow brought in approximately $158 million in revenue globally, earning the record for the biggest opening weekend since the pandemic. We are cautiously optimistic the momentum we're seeing will continue while closely monitoring the COVID-19 variants. As a monthly dividend company, our mission is to invest in people and places to deliver dependable monthly dividends that increase over time. In July, we declared our 613th consecutive monthly dividends, and we have now increased the dividend 111x since our listing on the New York Stock Exchange in 1994. Since 1994, we have increased the dividend every year, growing dividends per share at a compound average annual growth rate of approximately 4.4%. And as a result, it's increasing the dividend every year for the last 25 consecutive years. We're proud to be a member of the exclusive S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which consists of only three REITs and 65 companies overall. Now I would like to hand our call back to Sumit. Thanks, Nate. Hi, Caitlin. Certainly. Thanks, Sumit. Thanks, Katie. So essentially, Katie, we have very positive momentum as we've discussed in our theater industry collections. And as we look forward towards the end of the year, there are a couple of things that we're really watching. And first is going to be collection experience, and that is sustained and in accordance with our contractual and any deferral agreement. Second is in relation to that experience going into not only the third quarter but the fourth quarter to ensure that we have consistency, that we maintain momentum on collections and that we're able to report the 98% to 100% collections that we're expecting going forward with no additional reserves. And so CBD, we're booking and looking and reviewing as part of our routine every week, every month, and we'll have more to report after the third quarter. I was just going to say that as it relates to the guidance, Brent, essentially, we're expecting as we move forward that we continue to incur and experienced positive rent collections similar to the trends that we've been seeing increased through the second quarter and consistent with the experience in July. Essentially, one of the aspects of green bond is there is some slight, if you will, favorability associated with the overall rate. I mean based on our research and tracking, it's about 10 basis points, but it's really more than that. It's really about making a statement as it relates to our ESG initiatives and as well, putting a framework out there that really allows us to partner with our clients and doing the right thing as we focus on reducing our carbon footprint. And as we go forward, yes, green bond is something that we're interested in. One of the things that we had talked about in our prepared remarks is the fact that the bond that we executed have about 40% fulfillment as it relates to real estate that meets the criteria. We're focused on completing that, not only with acquisitions that we execute in the UK and eventually potentially on the continent, but also in the US. And we think it's a great vehicle for us to move forward with not only from a liability management perspective and driving competitive weighted average cost of capital, but as I mentioned before, just doing the right thing, allowing us to partner in the right way with our clients to make a difference. As you can imagine, Chris, we're in close contact with our theater clients and have been so since the beginning of the pandemic and even beyond that. But as you've seen, I mean their liquidity position has improved significantly. Essentially, all theaters are open. And with that, we've had some great results at the box office. So that's all translating to improved collections together with the fact that we hold essentially the best assets. And so with that, we're working in partnership. We expect to be paid in full, as Sumit said, from the abatement activity, et cetera, very immaterial and nothing in relation to our theater clients. And moving forward, we are continuing to partner. We're focused on getting paid in full and that's the manner in which we're going forward. So nothing magic [Multiple Speakers]... I think we've talked about it in general, Chris. And suffice it to say that as it relates to deferrals, we're not at liberty to talk about any one client. But overall, I can explain to you our strategy and essentially, it's to get paid back in full here in the near term. Essentially, any of our deferral arrangements are spanning, call it, a year to 18 months out. We're expected to get paid back in terms of average deferral period within seven months. And as a matter of fact, some of our clients are paying us back early. And so overall, great job done by the team and again, good partnership with our clients."

            "content": "Thanks, Julie. Welcome, everyone. Building enduring relationships is inherent to our purpose as an organization, and I would like to thank all of our stakeholders for their continued support. I would like to express my appreciation to all of my Realty Income colleagues who continue to relentlessly pursue our growth initiatives, while in the sustained remote work environment. We are pleased with the momentum across all facets of our business, which is reflected in our revised 2021 AFFO per share guidance of $3.53 to $3.59. Our increased guidance range represents an improvement of 2.7% at the midpoint compared to our prior range as well as an improvement of 5% at the midpoint versus last year and is a function of several tailwinds to our business: first, an increase to our 2021 acquisition volume guidance to approximately $4.5 billion; second, the continued improvement in rent collections from our theater clients; third, our well-priced capital markets activity since the start of June, which further positioned our balance sheet for continued growth; fourth, our active asset management activities, which resulted in occupancy of 98.5% at quarter-end and rent recapture rates in excess of 104% on lease expirations during the quarter; fifth, the overall quality of our portfolio, which has been curated, refined and underwritten over our 52-year history continues to perform throughout a variety of environments. We'll discuss each of these elements in greater detail shortly. Year-to-date, we have added approximately $2.2 billion of high-quality real estate to our portfolio, including $1.1 billion of new acquisitions in the second quarter. We continue to expand our platform as our size and scale remain key competitive advantages that translate directly into shareholder value. This quarter, we sourced more than $20 billion of acquisition opportunities, ultimately selecting and closing on less than 6%. On a total revenue basis, approximately 54% of the acquisitions made during the quarter are leased to investment-grade rated clients, which brings our total investment-grade client exposure to approximately 50%. The weighted average remaining lease term of the assets added to our portfolio during the quarter was 11.5 years. The largest industry represented in our second quarter acquisitions was UK grocery stores, and 7-Eleven remains our largest client. We remain well diversified as our portfolio consists of over 6,700 assets leased to approximately 630 clients who operate in 58 separate industries located in all 50 U.S. states, Puerto Rico and the UK And during the quarter, we continued to generate healthy investment spreads of approximately 172 basis points while acquiring, in our view, the highest quality product in the marketplace. The quality of our acquisitions is evident throughout the entire life cycle of our portfolio as we have consistently demonstrated favorable recapture rates on expiring leases while maintaining a healthy occupancy level throughout a variety of economic cycles. During the quarter, we re-leased 58 units, recapturing 104.7% of expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have executed over 3,700 re-leases or sales on expiring leases, recapturing over 100% of rent on these re-leased contracts. And occupancy at quarter-end was 98.5% based on property count. Our international investment activities continue to support our growth outlook, and our UK portfolio has now grown to over $2.7 billion. This quarter, the UK accounted for over 50% of the $1.1 billion of total acquisitions only. Year-to-date, we've added approximately $1 billion in high-quality real estate in the UK across 41 properties. And of the more than $21 billion in acquisitions opportunity that we sourced, approximately 31% is related to international markets. As we continue to expand our international platform, we will look for additional geographies that offer opportunities similar to that of the UK. We seek to acquire real estate in markets where opportunities are abundant. There is considerable demand for sale-leaseback transactions from industry-leading operators, and the local real estate can generate long-term IRRs in excess of our long-term cost of cabin. At this time, I'll pass it over to Christie, who will further discuss results from the quarter. Thank you, Christie. Before we open up the line for questions, I did want to provide a brief update on our pending merger with VEREIT. Our special shareholder meeting to approve the merger is scheduled for August 12, and we remain focused on the fourth quarter closing, subject to the satisfaction of all closing conditions. As I hope you can all appreciate, we are limited in any incremental information we can provide related to the merger beyond what has already been publicly disclosed. In conclusion, we are energized and pleased with the momentum across all areas of our business, which is reflected in our updated earnings guidance and increased growth projections for the year. As we have proven, with greater size comes enhanced prospects for growth, and we look forward to continuing to execute on these initiatives to ultimately deliver favorable full cycle AFFO per share growth with minimal volatility. At this time, I would like to open it up for questions. Operator? Nate, thank you for your questions. So I hope to attempt to answer all of them, but I might miss a few. In terms of our volume, look, this is a continuation of a theme that we started the year with. And as you might recall, Nate, January, we had come out with a very robust pipeline. We've already sourced year-to-date more than $40 billion. And clearly, at the run rate that we've been able to achieve over the last three quarters and year-to-date, you can have a sense for the robustness of the pipeline. And I think the biggest surprise for us has been our -- the volume that we've been able to generate in the UK, some of which sort of translated to what we were able to accomplish in the second quarter. But even if you look year-to-date, it's representing about 40% of acquisitions. And the quality of the product that we're continuing to see, the relationships that we've been able to establish and grow in the UK during a very short period over the last two years is a testament to why we feel very comfortable with having increased our acquisition guidance by another $1.25 billion given that we are clipping away at $1 billion. So in terms of the pipeline, we are very happy with what we are seeing. We are very comfortable with the product that we are seeing. And I think this is -- this trend is going to continue. In terms of the makeup, you might have seen that depending on the quarter, anywhere between 25% to 30% of what we are acquiring is industrial. In the second quarter, 15% of overall acquisition was industrial, largely driven by about 35% industrial in the U.S. And we -- again, on the relationship front have been able to make a fair amount of progress, are seeing acquisition opportunities, sometimes before it even hits the market and being able to try to get some of these transactions over the finish line with the relationships that we have developed. And I think you should expect to see this 15% to 25% of our volume coming from the industrial side of the equation in terms of asset type continue over the next few quarters. In terms of cap rate, look, it's a very aggressive market. I think in previous calls, I've mentioned that cap rates have continued to compress, tighten whatever the right word is. And it's -- I think it's a testament to certainly the type of products that we are pursuing, but more so to the fact that net lease is a very unique way of investing in real estate that is very specific. And as such, for the type of products that we pursue, we have continued to see cap rates compress. And by the way, this is across the spectrum on the credit curve. It's not just on the investment-grade side. In fact, I'd argue on the investment-grade side, the compression has been more muted on a relative basis versus what we have seen on the high-yield side of the equation. So -- and that trend is continuing, and we saw that in the second quarter as well. I believe on the industrial front, it has continued to tighten, but it has -- the speed with which it's tightening has certainly slowed down. And we're seeing products on the industrial side for well-located assets in the high 3% cap rate, low 4% ZIP code to, on the rare occasion, high 4%, low 5% ZIP code depending on location. On the retail side, it's a similar story for high-quality assets with long lease terms, good growth, you're seeing in the low 4% to low 5% ZIP code. And then if you're willing to compromise on lease term or growth rates or what have you, perhaps credit, you can see transactions transacting in the mid-5% to low 7% ZIP code. But the stuff that one buys in the high 6s, low 7%, that has credit profiles, lease terms, et cetera, that obviously has a much higher risk profile associated to it. So I don't know if I got all your questions in, Nate, but please let me know if I missed something. Yes. Thank you. We certainly have, and this is something that I have touched on in some of my previous calls. We just haven't been able to get some of these transactions over the finish line, but we are very close. The success that we have accomplished in the UK is one that we are trying to mimic in similar geographies with similar risk profiles. And with every day, every week that goes by, we are getting ever so close to being able to report to you additional markets that we've been able to add, which will become incremental source of growth for our business. But the direct answer to your question is, yes, we continue to look at opportunities, and we've come pretty close, but haven't been able to get them all the finish line as of the end of the second quarter. Thanks, Nate. Yes. That's a very good question, Caitlin. Look, in terms of predicting what can happen in the future, some of what you see is publicly available. You have seen some large companies come out and say as part of their financing, sale leaseback is going to be a source of capital, and they've come out with multibillion dollar numbers. And those are the ones that are obvious, both you've seen that here in the U.S. and you've seen that in the UK as well, with some of the M&A work that happened and large sale-leaseback opportunities on the industrial front in one specific transaction in the UK and then there was a retail client here in the U.S. that has come out with something like that. But I think what we would like to be able to change is to proactively go and be a solution for transactions that may not be in the public eye. And given the fact that we will have the size and scale, it is more difficult for me to predict as to how many of those opportunities can we create. When you talk to large companies and you go in there and you say, \"Oh, we can do -- we can take $1 billion of your real estate off the balance sheet.\" Sometimes that's not meaningful enough to engage in a conversation. I mean, here, we are talking about $70 million, $80 million, $100 million companies, and that sort of capital doesn't really move the needle for them. And so what we are very optimistic about is to be able to use our pro forma on larger scale to be able to have more aggressively some of these conversations that we started a few years ago. And the feedback that we had received was, oh, yes, thanks a lot, just not big enough for us to be meaningful to engage. And so I think those conversations, we hope to get over the finish line and create more opportunities. But Catlin, I can't sit here and tell you that there will be one or two of those transactions per year. I think we have to view those where we are generating those transactions on our own as opportunistic. And time will tell as to how many of those we can sort of get over the finish line. But even if you were to just look at the ones that are not opportunistic, the ones that are part of M&A capital strategies, you're starting to see a lot more today than you ever did in the past. And I've just referenced two transactions in the recent, call it, five months, six months period. I'm not trying to suggest that you should extrapolate that. But those types of transactions didn't see the light of day three years ago, four years ago. And so that's what gives us confidence that being a larger company will allow us to more proactively take advantage of these opportunities that present themselves and be that one-stop shop, which even with our current size, we sometimes fall short. Yes. Our watch list stands right around 4% currently, Caitlin. And again, what gives us a lot of confidence is if you look at our collection numbers in July, which we shared with you, it's about 99%. And some could argue over that 99% may have built in a lot of abatements and a reduction in rent that you might have passed on to clients. And I just want to make sure that we make it very clear that it doesn't. I mean, if you look at the numbers, and we've put this out publicly, if you look at the abatement number, it's about slightly more than $1 million on $1.6 billion of rent. So it's about 90 basis points is what we have -- not even actually, it's a lot less than that, what we have updated, and these are largely to smaller operators. So when we are collecting above 99% on rent that has largely not been abated, it's very similar to what we had pre-COVID that should be a testament to the credit profile of the tenants that we are exposed to, and that is by design. So we feel very good about where we are and especially with every month that goes by this continued optimism that we have in our ability to get back to pre-pandemic levels without having to give abatements, I think, is a testament to the credit quality of our operators. Sure. Katie, if you wouldn't mind, I'll have Christie talk to that. Sure. So Katie, part of the strategy we had was to use a combination of folks that we had in-house and some companies that we felt very comfortable with outsourcing to as third-party providers for services that we needed. And obviously, if we -- as our portfolio has grown and now it's about $2.7 billion in the UK, a lot of these third-party providers provide services that we can accommodate internally at margins that are superior to what we were getting outsourcing those particular functions. So as we have grown, we are bringing in-house more and more of these services. One of the other things that we are trying to look at and consider is as we grow into additional markets, and we believe that to be a matter of time, where is it that we should be domiciled, et cetera? And that work has -- we've made a tremendous amount of progress on that front as well. So before we bring in some of these functions in-house, we wanted to make sure that we were structured appropriately to accommodate our continued growth in Europe. And so there will be more to come on that front, but we will certainly be able to create synergies by bringing some of these outsourced services in-house. And it's largely going to be a function of where we ultimately decide to be headquartered to help support the European expansion. And -- but those discussions are ongoing, and we'll have more to report on that front as and when we establish our operations, et cetera. So Greg, part of it was, if you looked at the first quarter, we were in the low 5s in terms of what we were able to accomplish in the UK It's a function of the asset types that we are able to get over the finish line as well as some of the operators that we pursue, the lease term, et cetera, et cetera. And we were hoping to actually close on a few transactions that were slightly more higher yielding in the first quarter that slipped into the second quarter, which is the primary reason for this higher cap rate. In terms of competition, every day that goes by, I'm exaggerating, of course, the competition in the UK is increasing. I think people have started to realize that, that is a market that affords good risk-adjusted returns. And so I don't see competition as being the dictate as to whether we should increase, decrease the quantum of transactions that we pursue in the UK. We have a very defined -- clearly defined strategy in the UK And if there are transactions that we see, if they meet those particular criteria, we pursue it and we pursue it aggressively. And I think that's what's going to dictate the amount of volume. Now clearly, the volume has increased, and part of it is because it took us a while to establish ourselves, establish our name and establish those -- the reputation that we have and the relationships that we've built. But if there are opportunities and more opportunities to -- if the volume of opportunities increase, you can totally see us increasing the amount of acquisitions that we get over the finish line in the UK But we're going to be very true to our strategy that we laid out, and that's not to say it's a static strategy that doesn't get looked at, and it doesn't get added to or subtracted from. It's just something that we spend a lot of time first figuring out what is the right product to pursue and then react to that strategy that we have thoughtfully laid out for ourselves. So it could be volume of acquisitions increase as more and more products start to come to the fourth. For sure, it could. Is competition increasing? Yes. But I think the way for us to think about our international strategy is to think in terms of newer markets to continue to add to the volume of overall acquisitions, not necessarily do more in a given location. Part of it was pricing. It got so aggressive. These were transactions that met a lot of our strategic objectives that we had laid out. But there's just a lot of capital that is chasing these deals, like I said. And when it got to a point where it didn't make economic sense for us to continue to pursue, we backed away. And I think that has largely been the reason why we haven't sort of gotten into some of the other markets. But I will say that as we have become more visible in given geographies, just like we did in the UK, people are getting familiar with our names. And so there might have been transactions that we might not have seen two years ago or 1.5 years ago, that we are now seeing because people understand that we -- they understand what we were able to do in the UK That reputation has translated to Continental Europe. And the fact that we have pursued a few transactions has obviously led credence to our ability and our desire to grow our portfolio in those particular markets. And I think that is translating into the flow that you need to get into to establish a particular market. And so we are very optimistic that over the next few quarters, you will start to see us expand into other markets outside of the UK I wouldn't say it's more than in the UK What I would say is the pricing could be the folks -- the capital markets environment in Continental Europe versus the UK is different. And that translates into a more aggressive pricing environment at times. And so, we're going to be very disciplined at, Greg. And if we don't feel like it makes sense on a risk-adjusted basis, we are not going to pursue it just for the sake of expanding into new markets. But having said all of that, I'm very optimistic about being able to add to our UK expansion in the near term. Yes. So Haendel, when you say UK, we've been looking at transactions in Scotland, Wales and England. Those are the three countries that we focused on. So the fact that we have closed on a particular transaction, and I don't recall off the top of my head whether we did or we didn't, is not new. We -- from the time we've gone into the UK, we've been looking at all three countries -- not Northern Island yet, just to be clear. The cap rate is really a function of what gets closed in a given quarter handle. As you know, the industrial market is trade at lower cap rates, especially if it has the lease term, et cetera. And it's a similar story on the retail front as well. Perhaps it's slightly higher than the industrial side, but not that much higher, especially if it has lease term and it's with one of the top three operators, top four operators on the grocery side of the business. So it really is a question of whether it's industrial or retail. Within retail, is it grocery or home improvement? What is the duration of the lease term? All of that goes into the mix to define what the cap rate is. And yes, within the three countries as well, there is a slight discrepancy in terms of cap rates, what a similar asset would trade in Scotland versus in England. But it's a function of all of those various factors that go into what the cap rate is for a given transaction. And we have, like I have said before, a very clearly defined strategy. And depending on what gets over the finish line that translates to the cap rates that we've shared. So this particular quarter, it was about 6%. And in the first quarter, it was in the low 5s. So it blended out to -- in the mid to high 5% cap rates, which I think is what one should expect going forward. Yes. The 10% is the overall system accretion. It is inclusive of the office assets. It's inclusive of the entire company. And that's the extent of the comments I'm going to make. I think you can look at the investor deck that we had put out that walks you through the mechanics of what that 10% really entails. But if you look at these two companies and you have one company buying another company, what is the accretion, it's 10%. That's how you should think about it, actually, not 10%. Ronald, yes, it's absolutely part and parcel of our strategy. We play across the risk spectrum and the credit spectrum. And so just because something is high yielding doesn't necessarily always mean that it has risk associated with it, for which you are not getting paid. But we don't find those very often. I'll also go ahead and say that. And -- but if we do, and it just happens to have a high 6% cap rate associated with it, and the fact that we have certain competencies on our asset management and leasing side of the equation, which we believe are true competencies that are -- that make us based on some of the results that we've shared, we feel a lot better about being able to pursue those opportunities. And the more assets that we reposition, et cetera, the better we are able to underwrite some of the risk that's inherent in the high-yielding opportunities that we see. And so as we continue to build on our competency of repositioning assets and being able to generate spreads that are north of what the existing spreads were, I think we will look at more higher-yielding opportunities. But it's -- they don't come very often, but it's certainly part of our strategy, Ronald. So Ronald, it's a long -- the range of cap rates that I've shared with you that we are seeing in the market on assets that we are pursuing, I do think that where we have seen compression, the retail assets continue to compress more today than the industrial assets. But we hear stories of certain transactions that happen at cap rates that we've never seen before, but I would consider that to be one-off. But it is a question of a lot of capital chasing the same set of products that we find ourselves interested in. And that has resulted in the environment that we find ourselves. Having said all of that, we are still generating -- in the second quarter, we generated over 170 basis points in spread, which is better than our average spread over the duration of our history of acquiring assets. So even in this environment, we are very competitive and we are able to grow our portfolio and generate above average spreads. So we feel very good about where we are. But I don't think that it's a sustainable environment where cap rates continue to compress, especially if it's -- funny I say this, but the 10 year trading in the 1 15, 1 16 ZIP Code, but where the expectation is that inflation should come in and interest rates at some point will start to go back up, I think that's going to be the floor for this continued compression. But we are starting to see some level of stabilization, certainly on the industrial side. I think, Brent, what AMC was able to do is largely along the lines of what their CEO has suggested to the market that they now are sitting on plenty of capital where they can play offense and where they see opportunities with assets that are well located but the operator is no longer there or is in a distressed situation, they're going out and buying out the operators. And that I think is very prudent. We haven't been in the market trying to sell our assets or anything like that. We had a thesis that we have shared with you and with the market about the theater business as an industry. We've also shared with you that the assets that we believe we have tend to be very well located and in terms of performance are in the top two quartiles a vast majority of our assets. And so our expectations have always been that this business will come back and we will start to collect 100% of our rent, and that our operators will start to pay back some of the deferred rent, which in one case has already started. But I did see some news around assets having traded and I think it might have been one of our peer companies that sold a couple of layer assets. But we really are not playing in the market rent. For us, it was more of about in the off chance that we do get some of these assets back, how can we reposition them. And I think I've made comments in the past around our confidence in being able to reposition some of these assets just given their location and given the demand for alternative use. But we haven't been looking to buy more assets nor have we been looking to sell any of our theater asset. So can't really comment on that outside of what I saw in the press. We haven't changed -- yes, go ahead, Christie... Well, we haven't really seen one of those larger transactions here in the US actually transact, so I can't really comment on that, Linda. But traditionally, we had always seen a discount on the portfolio transactions vis-a-vis what you see in the one-off market. And my expectation would be that in order to facilitate multibillion dollar sale leaseback transactions that that discount will continue to be there vis-a-vis the one-off markets, but time will tell. We certainly have seen a compression on that discount but I believe that there will have to be a discount in order for an institutional buyer like ourselves to continue to engage. Otherwise, what's the difference? We could pick these assets off in the one-off market and we certainly have the infrastructure to do that. So that's my belief. So I mean, on the cost of equity, obviously, it's the same. It's really the cost of debt that we see a major difference. You saw what we were able to do on the green bond issuance. I think it priced out at about 1.48% all in. If we were to do a similar issuance here in the US, I think the delta would be 30 to 40 basis points, maybe even larger. Now obviously, the environment today is very different from when we went to the market. But nevertheless, I saw a quote not just too long ago on a 10 year unsecured bond, it was 1.95, 1.98. And we got August, a nine year weighted average on the bond issuance that we just did, and that was at 1.48. So yes, that 50 basis point delta continues to be there. And that's really the advantage that we have, that we have assets, that could be financed with capital being raised locally. And so that's where the cost of capital advantage comes in. So John, I think we've been asked this question around our industrial portfolio and what is the allocation that we would like to see in an optimal portfolio, and we've said circa 20%. Today, we are right around 12%. So our desire is to grow that asset type to the 20% ZIP code. So I don't think your question is around why are we doing it. I think you prefaced your question by saying we have been in industrial. So I think that hasn't changed. Obviously, as we have underwritten industrial assets now for over 10 years, I think our first investment was in 2010, 2011 time frame We have evolved in terms of being able to take on assets that may have only nine years left on a lease rather than what we used to feel comfortable around doing 10 years ago, which was 15 year leases or 20 year leases and potentially doing it only through the sale leaseback channels rather than providing capital for takeouts, et cetera. And so clearly, on the lease term, we are very comfortable taking on high single digit, mid single digit lease terms, if we can get very comfortable with the market and inherent rent and what the price per square feet is for given assets and what the market can looks like on future rental growth, as well as alternative tenants that could step in. And if that allows us to pursue some transactions, we will absolutely do that. We are very proud of our industrial asset management team. And we share with you the renewals and the releases that we have on a blended basis. And those types of numbers have continued to give us confidence to grow our business and to grow our platform, and to bring in more and more people along with the team that we already have. That's very comfortable playing across the lease term, playing across the credit spectrum, et cetera. Having said all of that, we are still predominantly investment grade. But we are very comfortable playing across the credit spectrum on the industrial side, if we believe it's well located with good real estate metrics associated with it. Christie? So Chris, I'm very limited and constrained in terms of what I can talk about with respect to the merger. All I can tell you is we are right on schedule. One of the biggest hurdles, as you said, is our shareholder vote next week on the 12 -- well, it's on August 12. And then we -- if you look at our agreements, et cetera, I think you'll see a couple of other conditions that have been laid out, but we feel very comfortable, and we are on schedule so far. So I think by the third quarter, we'll have a lot more to share with you. And so if I can just ask you to be a bit patient, a bit more patient, I'd appreciate it. No, Chris. Nothing out of the ordinary. It's just a very healthy pipeline. It's exactly the type of product that you would expect Realty Income to pursue. So no large portfolios are part of this guidance. Spencer, actually, again, it's the exact opposite. If you look at the second quarter and you look at the resolutions, we were able to pick up 50 basis points essentially from where we were in terms of occupancy at the end of the first quarter versus the second quarter from 98% to 98.5%. It's largely a testament to what we were able to do on the asset sales side and these are vacant asset sales. I think we had close to 40 resolutions on that front. And then if you look at what the return profile has been, it continues to be year-to-date in that 8% plus unlevered returns. So I think it again goes back to where we buy assets, how fungible are these assets. If not for retenanting purposes to sell it vacant and still be able to capture returns that are well in excess of our long-term weighted average cost of capital. So we've been very successful and part of it is a testament to the team that we have in place. And we haven't seen any drop off, in fact, during this COVID-related downturn that we are coming out of. And I would go so far as to say that our speed, our ability to execute more transactions has continued to increase quarter-over-quarter. So that's the reason why we are so proud of being able to get to 98.5% despite suffering NPC's bankruptcy in the fourth quarter where we were handed back 70 odd assets, and we were able to get right back to that 98.5% ZIP code within two quarters. So we feel very good about our team and our ability to continue to take advantage of the market. I don't want to speak to specifics, Spencer, because we have NDAs, et cetera. But rest assured that was an asset where if we had discussions with the tenant and it was deemed better to sell it back and move forward. And again, on that particular asset, our overall return profile was well in advance of what we captured for the second quarter. So we feel very good about those opportunistic sales. There is no secret. We've already mentioned that we are not in -- I mean, office is not a long term asset type that we want to be exposed to. And we get these one-off opportunities to take advantage of them. So Alves, that's part of what we do across our portfolio pretty much on a daily basis. It's not just when we are buying large sale leaseback transactions. I mean, obviously, we are somewhat constrained being a REIT. You have holding period requirements, et cetera. But in the past, when we have done large sale leasebacks or larger sale leasebacks, there were some assets that we bought into our TRS primarily with the intent of managing our exposure to the tenant. And so that has always been part of our strategy and will continue to be part of our strategy going forward. So nothing new there. Well, not too long ago, we had 7% exposure to Walgreens. And now as you noticed, Greg, that has, over time, dwindled down to 7.5%. The biggest movement on the 7-Eleven transaction was that they closed on their Speedway transaction. And you might recall, we used to have, I don't know how many assets, but we were exposed to Speedway. And so once they closed on it, it's obviously now under 7-Eleven and that's what shows an increase in the 7-Eleven tenant client exposure. Then you might have noticed that on the Circle K, Couche-Tard side that went lower, and it's primarily because they sold some of the assets that were our assets to KC. And so that's the reason for some of the Couche-Tard concentration to be reduced from what you had seen in the previous quarter. So that's really what's happening. It's not us going out and doing transactions or what have you. Having said that, if transactions were to be available, we would absolutely pursue it. And we are very comfortable with individual clients representing 6%, 7%, not across the board but for certain clients, we are absolutely very comfortable with that. And 7-Eleven is definitely one of them. So Greg, this is part of our asset management strategy. Obviously, we are very comfortable holding on to assets. It's not like we are trying to manage to an occupancy number. But there is an analysis that we go through figuring out what is the holding cost, what is the re-leasing scenario look like, how long is that going to take, is there going to be capital contribution, are we better off selling it for whatever it is that we are able to get, what's the return profile looks like in a re-leasing scenario versus a sale scenario today. And once you look at the mix, you pursue a particular strategy, and that's largely what's driving the decision making process. And what we found was, yes, that some of the assets that we sold actually were the bankrupt assets that we got back from NPC. They were in high demand but not for re-lease. They were in high demand with folks that wanted to buy these assets outright. And when you look at the return profile, it was superior to us holding it and trying to find a new client that could step into those assets. Having said that, there are some assets that we actually re-leased to new clients as well. So it's a combination of strategies that we execute but the underlying premise and the goal has always been what is going to maximize our returns and whatever that answer is that it's selling it vacant versus finding a new tenant, that's dictated by this return profile. Well, thank you very much, and I look forward to coming back to you shortly. Bye-bye."

At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I would now hand the conference over to your speaker today, Julie Hasselwander, Investor Relations at Realty Income. Thank you. Please go ahead.\nJulie Hasselwander: Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's quarter operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer and Christie Kelly, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer. During this conference call, we will certain statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under Federal Securities law. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that cause such differences in the Company's form 10-Q. We will be observing a two-question limit during the Q&A portion of the call-in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you would like to ask additional questions, you may re-enter the queue. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy.\nSumit Roy: Thanks, Julie. Welcome, everyone. The continued strength of our business is made possible by the incredible partnerships we have with all stakeholders. I would like to express my gratitude and appreciation to our Realty Income team who continues to effectively execute our strategic objectives while enduring a sustained, remote work environment. As we've announced last week, we are excited to have reached a definitive merger agreement with VEREIT, which would further distance ourselves as a leader in the net lease industry and create a company with a combined enterprise value of approximately $50 billion. We believe shareholders of both companies will enjoy meaningful value creation through immediate earnings accretion and expanded platform with enhanced size, scale and diversification, driving further growth opportunities, and strategic and financing synergies which are enhanced by Realty Income's A rated balance sheet and access to well-priced capital. We are very excited about the strategic transaction and look forward to continuing to drive future growth together as a combined enterprise. However, today we will focus on what was a very successful first quarter for Realty Income. Our first quarter results illustrate our ability to grow through a variety of swim lanes afforded to us by our size and scale by completing over $1 billion in acquisitions. Notably, in this quarter, we invested approximately $403 million in high quality real estate in the UK, highlighting the continued strength of our international platform and bringing that total investment in the UK to over $2 billion since the first international acquisitions we closed in 2019. Domestically, we invested $625 million in real estate, including our first ever acquisition in Hawaii, becoming the first and only REIT to own property in all US states. Our accomplishments during the quarter continue to demonstrate the momentum in our business, and highlight our ability to leverage our size and scale to drive our business forward in pursuit of sustainable growth. On the subject of sustainable growth, our team continues to make tremendous progress through our ESG initiative, as ESG considerations continue to permeate throughout our organization at every level. In April, we published our inaugural Sustainability Report, which details our company's commitments, goals and progress to-date with regard to environmental, social, and government initiatives. I invite all Realty Income stakeholders to share in our dedication to embrace the changing world for the benefit of all those we serve. And I encourage everyone listening to read our 2020 Sustainability Report found on the corporate responsibility page of our website. Additionally, we are excited to share an updated investor presentation to the marketplace. On the homepage of our website, you can find our new deck, which highlights our fundamental business philosophies, key competitive advantages, and plan for future growth. Turning to results for the quarter, our global investment pipeline remains a significant driver of growth for our business. Our business is simple. We seek to acquire high quality real estate lease to leading operators in economically resilient industries in pursuit of stable and increasing cash flow generation. Our confidence in continuing to grow our platform stems from the quality of our real estate portfolio, which is designed for resiliency through a variety of economic environments. Key to mitigating economic risk, we believe in portfolio diversification by geography, client, industry and property type as we continue to grow our real estate portfolio. In the first quarter of 2021, we invested over $1 billion in high quality real estate and we remain very comfortable with our 2021 acquisition guidance of over $3.25 billion. On a total revenue basis, approximately 39% of total acquisitions during the quarter are leased to investment grade rated clients, which brings our total investment grade client exposure for the portfolio to approximately 50%. Aligning with our equals, the weighted average remaining lease term of the assets added to our portfolio during the quarter was 12.6 years. And at the end of the quarter, the weighted average lease term of our total portfolio was 8.9 years. As at quarter end, our real estate portfolio includes over 600 clients who operate in 56 different industries. Approximately 84% of rental revenue comes from our traditional retail properties, while industrial properties generated about 11% of rental revenue. With regard to our retail business, we seek to invest in industries with a service non-discretionary and or low price point component of the business, as we believe these characteristics make for economically resilient operation that can more effectively compete with e-commerce. As such of our acquisitions during the quarter, the largest industry represented were grocery stores. Walgreens remains our largest client at 5.5% of rental revenue, and convenience stores remain our largest industry at 12% of rental revenue. Our investment philosophy primarily focuses on acquiring freestanding single unit commercial properties leased to best-in-class clients under long-term net lease agreements typically in excess of 10 years. We believe the market is efficient. As such, we've seen a competitive environment for high quality assets leased to strong operators. Cap rates, as you all know, reflect an aggregation of many factors including but not limited to fundamental real estate economics, lease term, credit of the client or their sponsor, rent relative to the market, average rent coverage by the operator and alternative use of the real estate. Accordingly, the quality of our acquisitions is reflected in our average initial cash cap rate during the first quarter of 5.3%. Our size and scale allow us to be highly selective in pursuing investment opportunities that fit our stringent criteria. This quarter we sourced nearly $20 billion of transaction opportunities, ultimately investing in approximately 5% of the prospects sourced and reviewed. Additionally, our cost of capital allows us to invest accretively even when pursuing the highest quality assets. During the first quarter our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were 115 basis points. The quality of the assets we acquire flows through the entire lifecycle of our portfolio, allowing us to basically recapture rent on expiring leases and maintain a healthy level of occupancy. During the quarter, we re-leased 54 units, re-capturing 103.5% of expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have executed over 3600 re-leases or sales on expiring leases, re-capturing over 100% of rent on those re-leased contracts, and occupancy at quarter end was 98%. Our size and scale afford us the ability to execute large scale sale leaseback transactions which are often sourced through existing partnerships with best-in-class clients, but also serve as an attractive way to establish new relationships. The transaction we closed in Hawaii is an excellent example of the sale leaseback opportunities we can execute. In this instance, we partnered with Par Petroleum to acquire 22 well located convenience stores for approximately $116 million. All 22 properties fall under one triple net master lease agreement with an initial 15-year lease term. And all assets are located in many main locations, primarily on the island of O'ahu. This quarter, about 24% of all acquisitions we close were executed as sale leaseback transactions. The merger between Realty Income and VEREIT will enhance our ability to execute large scale leaseback transactions through expanded capacity to buy in bulk, which improve our competitive positioning when competing for portfolio or sale leaseback transactions in the fragmented net lease industry. As we have previously articulated, the ability to buy at wholesale prices and at a discount to the one-off market is a competitive advantage. We are often one of only a handful of buyers for large scale portfolio transactions, particularly those that would otherwise create untenable client or industry concentration issues for our competitors. Proforma for the closing of the transaction, we will have approximately $2.5 billion of annualized rental revenue. For every $1 billion of acquisition to a single creditor industry, our exposure to that creditor industry will increase by approximately 2% compared to around 3.5% based on our current size. By leveraging our size and scale, we continue to effectively execute through our international platform. We have healthy acquisition volume in the UK. Fundamentally, we are replicating our U.S. business strategy, seeking to curate a high-quality real estate portfolio leased to leading operators in economically resilient industries. Our total first quarter acquisition volume improved approximately $403 million of international acquisitions in the UK, which brings us total investment volume to more than $2 billion since the first transaction we closed in the UK in 2019. Our International pipeline has accelerated even more quickly than originally anticipated. This quarter's International acquisition volume represents nearly 40% of our total investment volume during the quarter. A figure that is truly incremental to the U.S. business and one that we expect to grow. Now I'll pass it over to Christie to provide financial updates.\nChristie Kelly: Thank you, Sumit. I'll start with some high-level background and then move into our financial results for the quarter. We're the only net lease REIT from the S&P 500, one of the top 10 largest U.S. REITs by enterprise value and the largest company in the net lease REIT sector. Upon closing our recently announced merger with VEREIT, Realty Income is expected to be the sixth largest REIT in the [ph] RMZ in terms of equity market capitalization. Our size and scale, in conjunction with our conservative balance sheets and financial strength have afforded us to a credit rating by the major rating agencies and our $3 billion multi-currency revolver grants us ample access to well-priced capital that allows us to opportunistically raise permanent long-term capital when the markets are most favorable. During the quarter, we raised approximately $670 million through an overnight equity offering to reduce our financing risk by pre-funding our active global investment pipeline. In January 2021, we completed the early redemption of all $950 million, 3.25% notes due in 2022 to take advantage of attractive borrowing rates in the fixed income market, while reducing our near-term financing risks. This redemption was primarily funded through our December issuance of $725 million of senior unsecured notes through a dual tranche offering of a five year and 12-year note, which achieved record low U.S. dollar coupon rates in the REIT sector for each of those tenors. As a result, our fixed charge coverage ratio, I'm pleased to report, has hit an all-time high at 5.8 times this quarter. We believe funding our business with approximately two-thirds equity and one-third debt contributes to maintaining a conservative balance sheet. We ended the quarter with net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 5.3 times or 5.2 times on a proforma basis, adjusting for the annualized impact of acquisitions and dispositions during the quarter. And our near-term debt maturities remain minimal, with only $26 million of debt maturing through year end 2021 excluding our commercial paper program and borrowings outstanding on our revolving credit facility. At the end of the first quarter, we had full availability of our $3 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility, $675 million outstanding under our $1 billion commercial paper program, and over $184 million of cash on hand, providing approximately $2.5 billion of liquidity available to capitalize on our active global investment pipeline. During the quarter, our business generated $0.86 cents of AFFO per share and we are maintaining our 2021 AFFO per share guidance of $3.44 to $3.49 on a standalone Realty Income basis unadjusted for the expected merger. Remember, we currently have 37 of our 79 Theater assets on cash accounting. These 37 theaters represent about $25.5 million dollars of annual rent remaining in 2021. And we've reserved $33.2 million as allowance for bad debt on these assets, net of $1.9 million of straight-line rent receivables. In total, this $58.7 million translates to approximately $0.15 that is not currently included in AFFO per share guidance. We are encouraged by the recent momentum in the theatre space, such as increased nationwide opening and the release of blockbuster films. Most recently, Godzilla versus Cong brought in approximately $49 million during the opening weekend, five days specifically Wednesday to Sunday, and generated more than $390 million in revenue within the first two weeks of its global release, turning a profit of more than $200 million. However, until we are confident these particular theaters can continue to pay us contractual rent. We will continue to recognize revenue for these 37 theatres on a cash basis. As the monthly dividend company, we would be remiss not to discuss the dividends when providing business results. In April, we declared our 610th consecutive monthly dividends and we now increase the dividend 110 times since our listing in the New York Stock Exchange in 1994. Since 1994, we have increased the dividend every year growing dividends per share at a compound average annual growth rate of approximately 4.4%. And as a result of increasing the dividend every year for the past 25 consecutive years, we are proud to be a member of the exclusive S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index which consists of only three REIT and 65 companies overall. I would now like to hand our call back to Sumit.\nSumit Roy: Thank you, Christie. Our first quarter results continue to highlight the incredible opportunities afforded to us by our size and scale, which uniquely position us to be the global consolidator in a highly fragmented net leased space. And we believe the very merger will enhance our positioning to be just that. Our positive results as well as our powerful business momentum and in strong outlook energize our talented team to continue expanding our existing verticals, while finding new swim lanes through which the business can grow. At this time, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Greg McGinniss from Scotiabank.\nGreg McGinniss: Hey Sumit. The VEREIT acquisition has dramatically increased your exposure to casual dining tenants to 7% of ABR, which is an industry where other REITs seem to be limiting exposure. What makes you comfortable with acquiring all those tenants?\nSumit Roy: That's certainly an area that we spent a fair amount of time focusing on Greg, when we were looking at VEREIT. The biggest contributor to that 7% is Red Lobster. And looking at where Red Lobster is today versus even where it was a year ago, gave us a fair amount of confidence that Red Lobster has turned the corner from being privately equity owned to being owned by a company out of Thailand Thai Union. And the credit enhancements that it achieved, the results that it is now posting, the fact that it gave --that it paid 100% of the rent in the fourth quarter to VEREIT. All of that gave us confidence that it's turned the corner and being vertically integrated organization, such as Thai Union is made us feel like 7% is a number that we can live with. But the goal here Greg will be over time to continue to reduce that, just like we did with our casual dining concept which used to be in the high single digits. And today represent less than 3% of our overall registry. And that will be the goal with on a proforma basis being up to 7% continuing to reduce that back down into the low single digits.\nGreg McGinniss: Okay, thank you. Second question, given less concern about tenant concentration issues following the VEREIT merger, are there portfolios in the marketplace today that you now feel more comfortable pursuing? Are those types of portfolios already considered in acquisition guidance? And then how much volume do you think those types of portfolios could potentially contribute to acquisition each year?\nSumit Roy: Yeah, there's a bunch of questions you've asked there, Greg. The question is, we've talked about how proforma for this acquisition, it allows us to pursue larger transactions. I will say that you don't have multibillion dollar transactions coming in every week. But when you do, they can be a step growth, opportunity, just like a consolidation is in our industry. But given our size today, doing a multibillion-dollar transaction, we were somewhat constrained, pursuing that even if it checked all the other boxes, i.e. we like the credit, we like the operator, we like the industry, we like the makeup of the real estate, we like the rent composition, et cetera, et cetera. You feel constrained, just given how much of your portfolio concentration gets impacted by a single tenant. But once you start to increase your platform, the ability to absorb larger transactions, when they present themselves, certainly enhances. And there have been opportunities and I don't want to get into details, when even in the past 12 months, there have been opportunities to pursue transactions, where given, everything that we have relationship, to check the boxes across the spectrum we were still constrained by the allocation that we had to be able to pursue this particular transaction single-handedly. And those are the types of constraints that do get alleviated, the larger your platform becomes. And it does allow you to be able to present yourself as a one stop shop for some of these very well capitalized businesses that you want to continue to be their one stop shop, which we have been in this one example that I'm referencing. So, yeah, I do think that, post this consolidation, that it will enhance our position to pursue transactions that we were, somewhat constrained to do so in our current size and scale.\nGreg McGinniss: Thanks, Sumit.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Katy McConnell from Citi.\nKaty McConnell: Hi there.\nSumit Roy: Hi Katy.\nKaty McConnell: Could you update us on the portfolio of office assets that you plan to spin off with the merger? And now that the deals out in the open what have you been able to gauge as far as buyer interest in your ability to potentially sell those off instead?\nSumit Roy: Kate, it's been three business days since we made the announcement. But thank you for asking the question. Yeah, look, we've been pleasantly surprised by the inbounds. We're still in the process of collecting those inbounds and trying to figure out what's real from what's not real? We have been very clear that the path that we control is the spin off path. To answer your question more directly, it's essentially all of our office assets along with the vast majority of the of the VEREIT office assets outside of the six assets that are constrained by a CMBS pool, which is cross collateralized across multiple asset types. So outside of the six, our goal would be to basically spin off all of the remaining assets, which is right around 97 properties, $182 million $183 million in rent, weighted average lease term circa 4, 76% 77% investment grade tenants. That's the makeup of the portfolio. But as we had thought would happen, once we announced there have been inbound calls, we are just gathering the information, but it is still too early to tell what's real from what's not. We are going to continue down the path that we control. And if something were to happen in the meantime, that's great. But it's too early to tell.\nKaty McConnell: Okay I appreciate that color. And then can you talk a little more about the decision to just enter the Hawaii market now? And whether you all want to increase the scale there more meaningfully or potentially pursue any industrial opportunities there?\nSumit Roy: Yeah, Katy, it's just, it's not something we intentionally pursued in this particular quarter. We've always, two CEOs ago, Tom was from Hawaii. And the inside joke was how come we don't have any properties there. Now, Jonathan Png is our resident Hawaiian. And the joke has continued, but it really was the function of the bright opportunity presenting itself at the right time with a partner that we liked, we underwrote their business, we underwrote their performance, we underwrote their locations, it was just the right time at the right place. And it just so happened that it closed in the first quarter. There wasn't any grand design to be able to come out and make the kinds of announcements that we have done. We've been very opportunistic, very lucky in some ways, and very grateful to now be able to say that we are in 50 states, but that to us was not as important as finding the right transaction. And this particular transaction that allowed us to go to Hawaii certainly checks all the boxes. So, we're very grateful for that.\nKaty McConnell: Okay, great, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ronald Kamdem from Morgan Stanley.\nRonald Kamdem: Hey, good afternoon, just two quick ones for me. The first is just on tenant's health in general on the portfolio. Maybe if you could provide some updated thoughts on how you're feeling today, maybe versus six and 12 months ago? And then digging in a little bit deeper into some of the theaters and looking at the collection rates there, maybe some insights as the collection rate may have been a little bit lower than what we would have expected. Maybe what's going on there with theaters?\nSumit Roy: Sure, Ronald, thank you for your question. Look, our watch list is right around 5%. And it's the biggest contributor to that watch list is the theater business. So, they are very much tied. And our collection is also largely a function of the collection in the theater business. We feel you asked me to give you a reference point as to how we feel about a theatre business today versus when we first got into the pandemic, we feel a lot better today than we did then. There have been actual examples here in the U.S., which were preceded by examples playing out in China and in Japan, which lend credence to the hypothesis that we had, that the theater business once the contents was starting to get released and the social distancing norms were relaxed, the theater business was going to be able to bounce back. That piece has largely proven out to be the case, Ronald. I mean, if you look at the only one example that we currently have of a big blockbuster movie that came out, which was the Godzilla versus Kong. In the first five days, it generated right around $49 million. We've been tracking how it has done subsequent to that as well. And it's right in that high 80 right around $90 million is the collection here in the U.S. theaters. If you look at it globally, it's close to $390 million. And the budget to make that movie was right around $180 million $190 million. So, $200 million roughly largely being gathered through the theater release. And that just continues to lay credence to that as content starts to come in, as these theaters are allowed to open, AMC is largely open here in the U.S. Regal is still not. Regal is still targeting mid to late May, to open up all of its theaters. And so, we do believe that this connection is going to become a function of the theaters opening. And based on the discussions that we've had with our operators, we continue to feel very optimistic that in the near term, those collection numbers will start to go up. But look, we're also blessed with a balance sheet, to lend grace to some of these operators, as long as we believe that their operating model is going to come through and it's going to be a viable business model going forward. And we genuinely believe that the theatre industry, and specifically these two operators are going to be viable operators going forward. And so, if we have the ability to lend our balance sheet, give them a little bit more grace, in terms of stabilizing their operating business model, that's what we've done. And we feel very good about that decision.\nChristie Kelly: And Ronald, this is Christie. The only thing I would add to Sumit's comments is just a reminder to the team that's on the line is that, our theater portfolio is really high quality. There's over 80% of the theaters in our portfolio that are in the top two core piles of each of the operator's footprint. And as Sumit mentioned AMC is open, but it limited capacity right now and Regal Theaters will be opening towards the end of May. And to that point, we're cautiously remain cautiously optimistic. But there's one thing I want to point out that, when we take a look at the momentum, as it relates to the collection rate in theaters, it's steady and improving. So, stabilize from year end, we were about 10% collection and then throughout the quarter, we've gained some momentum to build towards 16%. And so, we'll look forward to recording more when we come to the second quarter.\nRonald Kamdem: Great, that's helpful. My second question was just going back to the VEREIT merger. This may be just a simple question but just can you help us understand how your real estate the quality of your real estate, the quality of the retail assets that you own compares to those of VEREIT that you're going to be taking in, right? How should investor think about comparing and contrasting the quality of those portfolios, specifically, the retail piece? Thanks.\nSumit Roy: Yeah, Ronald we've got 3500 properties that has been constructed over the last 11 years, since they became public. Clearly there are areas of the portfolio, one of which we touched on, has turned the corner. But it wasn't something that we would have pursued in isolation six years ago when they when they chose to do that transaction. But by and large, I would say we were pleasantly surprised when we underwrote all of their assets, all of their operators at the quality of the portfolio they had, and there was an art to be making, for whatever reason, and we're grateful, because it allowed us to create a lot of value for our business, that they were trading at a massive discount to what we believe is the inherent value, especially of their retail and industrial portfolio. And so, the other point I would like to highlight is the fact that they are complementary to our focus. This is why, things like convenience stores which we are big fans of with certain operators I want to qualify allows us to go from 12% to 9% proforma for the combination. It allows us to take our grocery from 10% to 8%, because they don't have those allocations in their portfolio. And so that certainly helps us create additional capacity plus on the theater business, they didn't have much of an exposure. So that allows us to bring down our theater exposure from 5.7% 5.6% to 3.8%, which is starting to get closer to the optimal adaptation that we have been talking about over the last couple of quarters. So, pleasantly surprised on the upside, which is one of the main reasons why we decided to move forward. And we're so grateful that we found a like-minded person and Glenn and his management team to move forward with a transaction that we genuinely believe is a win-win for both parties. So, yeah, super happy to absorb that retail and industrial portfolio into the proforma Realty Income business.\nRonald Kamdem: Super helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho.\nHaendel St. Juste: Hey, good afternoon out there.\nSumit Roy: Hi Haendel.\nHaendel St. Juste: Can you talk about the - hello? Can you guys talk about the acquisition capital a bit more in the first quarter the low 5% of all 4.9% in UK? I believe last quarter, you suggested that cap rates would be - for this year would get back, would be similar to 2020 levels, they are closer to maybe 6% depending on mix? I understand you're seeing increased competition. We've heard of financial buyers getting 85% 90% LTV financing ABS market. So maybe, can you talk about the market and what roll that competition out from potential buyers? Is this playing on the pricing for the assets that you're looking at? And is it specific to any sub sector industry and if this low 5% cap rate is what we should expect in 2021?\nSumit Roy: Yeah. So, Haendel quarter-over-quarter these numbers are going to vary and it is largely a function of the mix. If you're going to be heavily industrial focus, the cap rates are going to be on the lower end. If you're going to be more retail focus, it will be on the higher end. I'm making general comments. Obviously, there are exceptions to even to what I just said. But if you look at what drove the UK cap rate, it was largely two industrial transactions that we did with the same seller that we have a very good relationship with. One was an industrial asset in the Greater London area, highly sought clearly a last mile location and we got it at a cap rate we felt very comfortable owning this particular asset. Another one was in the suburbs of Birmingham; you know that it's leased to a single a credit. Again, fantastic distribution center below market rents. Something that we feel like is going to be super additive to our portfolio going forward. And that's what really drove the cap rate to where it was. Had we excluded those two, our cap rate would have been closer to where we did our fourth quarter UK transactions, which was, I believe, if I remember correctly, 5.6 5.7 cap rate. So, it really is going to be a function of mix, it's going to be a function of which geography dominates, et cetera, et cetera. But I don't think you should expect the cap rate we posted in the first quarter to be the new norm. I would still say that we should average right in that mid 5s to do slightly above that, that would be the goal. And in quarters where we do some more higher yielding stocks, because it's things that we found that the people are not focused on yet, we could see a potential 6. But it really is going to be a function of a mix, it's going to be a function of asset type, lease term, geography, all of those things that go into defining what a quarter cap rate signifies. But I think the bigger point here is, this is the second quarter in a row where we've done a billion dollars. And I've seen a lot of numbers coming out talking about Oh, in order for them to get to the high single digit growth rate, they're going to have to do $4 billion of acquisition. We welcome that challenge. In fact, we are excited about that challenge. And we've already talked about what creating these new verticals for us, new markets growth for us has done to our sourcing numbers, which is not translating into actual [ph] clothes. So, for us, the numbers being posted, yes, for most net lease businesses that's a staggering number. But for us, it's something that we welcome, and we also agree with the market that it is for us to show to you that we are capable of doing this on a quarter after quarter after quarter basis. So that's where the fun part is for us and the team. We look forward to that challenge. And we look forward to posting numbers with assets that doesn't compromise what we have said is our risk profile. And that's the key message here, that we are doing all of this. And we are growing our platform and we are growing our portfolio with the right type of industries, right operators, right geographies, right growth rates, all of the things that we create sustained value over the long term. So, I know you didn't quite ask that. But I just wanted to make sure that we output the answer on cap rates in context to what it is that we are trying to do. And the sustainability of what it is that we're trying to do. So, forgive me for that Haendel.\nHaendel St. Juste: No. That's perfect. Thank you for the color, I certainly appreciate it. Can you also talk a bit perhaps, are you a bit more willing today at all to consider industries that you perhaps put off to the side over the past year in the aftermath of COVID? Perhaps, expanding your investment playbook here, be automotive more entertainment or experiential things that have been a bit less COVID resilient, but given the improving vaccine distribution as the economic expansion, just curious if that view is changing at all, and if there's any specific industries reflect to?\nSumit Roy: Haendel, one of the things that will distinguish this team, I think, and I believe in, is the fact that we will always remain humble. If data is changing on the ground, if trends are changing, we're constantly trying to mark the market. But what we don't want to do is over index to any near-term phenomenon, just like we didn't over index to the fact that, hey, the theater business and the health and fitness business really took a took a beating in an environment where you have social distancing requirements. And does that mean we should go down to zero in both those businesses? The answer is no. And so, what we are trying to figure out is, what are the trends, especially given the long-term nature of the leases that we enter into, what is the trend long term that we are going to underwrite to? And just because something creates a potential opportunity near term, if we can't get comfortable with the long-term prospects, we will largely stay away from those types of situations. Now that doesn't mean we don't get a few things wrong. And in hindsight, we don't go back saying, Oh, we should have made that a different way, because our conclusion was inaccurate. But we, I believe, have gotten more things right than wrong. And that has served us well. So, the answer to your question is, without getting into specifics that we are constantly trying to upgrade our pieces to reflect what's on the ground. But we don't try to over index to it without taking into consideration with the long-term impacts of those immediate trends that we're seeing. I'll throw something out there, which is the exact opposite of what you're suggesting. I think there is an opportunity in the office sector. Now, are we going to go into the office sector? No, there's a reason why we said we are going to be spinning off all of our office assets. But I do believe that given the environment today, and given how negative the sentiment is around the office asset type, there is value to be had. If somebody is willing to take a longer-term perspective on what is office going to look like. And that's the reason why we want to create a spin off if that is the route, we end up eventually evacuating. We want to set it up for success. And it is a play on what we have seen near term. And then it's forecasting out that trendline to see what do you think it's going to happen to Office five, seven, 10 years from now? Where do we see growth? Yes, growth? I use that word with Office. Where do we see opportunities? And, there is an argument to be made that that could play out so Time will tell.\nHaendel St. Juste: Any perspective you want to share on the casinos? I know it's been asked in the past. But I'm curious is that view and that subsector is any different or any more willingness today to act on that?\nSumit Roy: Yeah, I'm not going to talk about specifics Haendel. And you've always asked me very specific questions, and I've tried to stay away from it. You asked me about M&A. And I did M&A for you now. No, no, stay away from specifics Haendel. Thank you though.\nHaendel St. Juste: Appreciate the time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Caitlin Burrows from Goldman Sachs.\nCaitlin Burrows: Hi, guys, hi there. Sumit, you gave some details to explain the relatively lower cap rate in the UK this quarter. But there's also the associated tax burden in the UK which impacted numbers in the quarter. So, I was just wondering, kind of big picture if you could go through why the UK investment activity makes sense to you bigger picture and then also how we should think about the associated tax expense going forward?\nSumit Roy: Yes, very good questions, Caitlin. Thank you. I should have actually completed my answer on the UK, giving a little bit more color on the structuring side of the equation. So, we went into the UK recognizing that there's going to be an associated track tax leakage. And when we underwrite transactions, we take into account what is our effective tax rate? What is the statutory tax rate? What's the effective tax rate? How much are we really making in terms of actual spreads, et cetera, et cetera. And of course, comparing it to the cost of capital, which is also much lower in the UK. And seeing if it's if it made sense. It made a lot of sense. And by and large, I think we are tracking to the effective tax rates that we had shared with the market two years ago in April of 2019. What I would like to add Caitlin is, there is a change that is being contemplated, that would actually increase the statutory tax rate in the UK market. But what we have been exploring and hopefully we'll be able to implement in the near term is restructuring our Realty Income limited the legal entity that that is house there where we will actually end up potentially saving 400 basis points off of our effective tax rate. So, do you expect to see this this the taxes being paid in the UK continuing to go up? Absolutely, you should. But not at the same rate as you have seen over the last three years. We are getting more efficient. We are structuring our transactions going forward in a manner where we are actually going to see on an effective basis and decrease in the tax leakage associated with our investments. And we are constantly looking at how we're going to be financing this transaction, and does it still make sense? And the answer is a resounding yes, it does. And that's the reason why we're continuing to do what we're doing.\nCaitlin Burrows: Got it. Okay. And then maybe switching topics, the guidance that you guys have put out assumes that same store revenue improves as the year goes on. There was commentary earlier on hopefully improving theater collections and performance and acquisitions are expected to continue. But the AFFO guidance kind of barely implies any growth from the 1Q run rate. So, I was just wondering, why is that? How does the improving same store revenues and acquisitions not translate into more meaningful AFFO for the guidance or is the AFFO guidance just pretty conservative at this point?\nSumit Roy: That's an opinion. I'll let you conclude that for yourself, but I do think Christie mentioned as to the 37 assets that are on cash accounting, so, so much of the improvement that could play out in the future has not been sort of reflected in the guidance that we have shown, but nor have we changed our cash accounting on those 37 assets. So, we really, if you want to use the word conservative, fine, we just really want to see actual collections go back up to levels that warrant a change in our thesis around cash accounting versus not. And then that would certainly translate to higher AFFO per share trend lines. But we tend to be a little bit more deliberate. And, yes, things are looking very optimistic. But until it's not actually starting to reflect in enclosed monthly statements, we're going to stay the course. And, obviously, what we have and the reason why we haven't adjusted is for the merger is because first and foremost, there are conditions involved. And even if this were to close, it won't happen to the fourth quarter, which clearly will have a very minimal impact this year. And so, for those reasons, we have kept the guidance, exactly the same. We want to digest what we just announced last week. We also want to get another quarter under our belt, and then we revisit earnings at the end of the second quarter. And share with you what our latest thoughts are on that.\nCaitlin Burrows: Okay, thank you.\nChristie Kelly: Thanks, Caitlin.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Rob Stevenson from Janney.\nRob Stevenson: Good afternoon. You guys currently have as of March 31, 131 vacant assets and presumably you'll have additional assets become vacant over the remainder of the year. Ordinarily, some percentage of that you guys keep and release and some you sell and move on. Given the size of the very transaction of the integration process, how do you guys think about your team's bandwidth and maybe just selling a greater percentage of the vacant assets that they can't be released easily and moving on, and focusing on the integration versus the time energy and even the potential upside from re-leasing vacancy?\nSumit Roy: We are very comfortable executing exactly the same business model that we have. We have always said that, if you want to run a business 100% occupancy we can. But that is not value optimizing solution. And the reason why we have also shared with the market, our real estate operations team as is the largest in the company is to be able to do the things that we want to do. That is the reason why we have always said that 98% is the right occupancy level for us because we are going to be repositioning assets where we can create, and these numbers get buried, but 140% 170% recapture rates on rent just because of these repositioning that we are able to do but yes, it takes time and yes, that means more, you're sitting on more non-occupied assets. But we are very comfortable doing that, if that is the right economic solution to do so. And just to put things in perspective, that 131 was 140 at the end of the fourth quarter, because we got 65 of our NPC assets back. And the team was able to not only absorb the first quarter explorations, but make a dent and a pretty good one on those assets that were handed back in the NPC transaction. I am super comfortable with the team that we have and the asset management team that is led by TJ, they are a phenomenal group. And what we would like to be able to do is when we absorb VEREIT, is to be able to implement the same business model, which is a reason why we think we want to hold on to a lot of their folks and potentially share our business model with them, and tried to generate the same types of results that we've been able to generate on a standalone basis. That is another area that we can enhance through this combination.\nRob Stevenson: Okay. And then second question, how are you thinking about [Indiscernible] going forward? It's been mostly non-retail as of late. And even overall, it's a pretty small piece of O today about to get much smaller with the acquisition? Do you need to keep that to fulfill obligations to the customers? Does that go away? How should we be thinking? Does that - Is there a chance that that gets bigger going forward for you guys?\nSumit Roy: Rob, I missed the key word, because there was a big beep. What is it that you said that we need to keep forward? And it's a very small part of our business?\nRob Stevenson: The development business.\nSumit Roy: It's that. Yeah.\nRob Stevenson: It's mostly non-retail, and it's really even overall, a really small piece of O today, going to get much smaller. Do you grow that? Does that need to stay because of commitments to customers et cetera? How are you thinking about that business?\nSumit Roy: Very good question. We hope to grow that business. It's about a $200 million business today. And you're absolutely right, that's not very large compared to the balance sheet that we have. But, some of the repositioning's I alluded to, some of the relationships that we have with existing industrial clients who want expansion capabilities, some of the relationships that we are developing with developers to provide a capital source, that could be a takeout, all of that is incredibly valuable to us. And I would love to see with a bigger platform, make this 3X 4X or what it is today, and being another contributor of value to our business. And so, we have a team that we have continued to grow, and through this combination, we will potentially grow this team even more, so that we can continue to enhance value going forward, even while just working on our own existing assets. And going back to your previous question working on vacant assets or soon to be vacant assets, and doing repositioning. That requires an enhanced expertise in the development front. So, we will certainly hold on to it and grow it. And potentially grow the allocation from where it is today.\nRob Stevenson: Okay, thanks, guys. Appreciate it.\nChristie Kelly: Thanks Rob.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brent Dilts from UBS.\nBrent Dilts: Hey guys. Just Sumit, following up on your \u2013\nChristie Kelly: Hi Brent.\nBrent Dilts: Hey, Christine, how are you?\nChristie Kelly: Good. How are you, Brent?\nBrent Dilts: Doing great. Sumit, just following up on your comment earlier about the $4 billion in acquisitions. This year that you've seen some analysts write about I'm just curious, are you seeing anything in the market that could call the slowdown in the pace of your transaction activity in the near term? Just seems like you're on pace to well exceed the minimum 3.25 you guys got to do. So, I'm just curious what you're seeing there?\nSumit Roy: Brent we are very optimistic. We, to be very honest with you, we are not seeing anything, we are obviously following some of the same rules coming out of DC and how it is going to have an impact et cetera. We are not seeing any of that translate into the volume being sourced. And our belief in not only meeting but potentially exceeding what we have shared with the market as our acquisition target. We started the year. And I think, Brent, if you recall, when we came into January, we shared with you what our pipeline looks like and how optimistic we were, that optimism has just continued to grow. So, we are super excited about not just the sheer volume but the quality that we are seeing and the quality that we are being able to get over the finish line. So, the platform is working.\nBrent Dilts: Okay, perfect. And then just digging into the transaction activity a little bit more. Could you talk about what you're seeing for some of the trouble tenant asset classes as reopening plays out and rent collection rates there improve. Are you seeing any of those assets starting to trade health and fitness, movie theaters, et cetera?\nSumit Roy: Sure. We've certainly seen a couple of trades on the health and fitness side, especially with the more established operators. We've seen a few vacant assets on the theater side sell. So yes, people are getting much more optimistic about the future and are willing to buy vacant pieces of land with a building and reposition it. And that optimism is starting to filter in into the acquisition arena. But that's not an area that we play in. But it's certainly it's certainly something that's seen.\nBrent Dilts: Okay. Thank you. Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Wes Golladay from Baird.\nWes Golladay: Hi, everyone. Sort of a few quick questions for you. Hi there, Christie. Looking at the industrial same store revenue, looks like it's been negative 40 basis points last year, and it continued into this year. Do you expect that to reflect later this year?\nSumit Roy: Yeah, Wes, it's largely driven by this one asset that we had incorrectly calculated the CPI adjustment to it. And when we realized our mistake, and of course, we had collected rent on that. We went back to our clients and we shared with them that look, there was a mistake. And we gave them all - we readjusted the rent going forward. And that's really what you're starting to see play out. And so, obviously the client was incredibly happy about us coming out and sharing this information. But that's really what you're seeing play out. If you look at the actual leases on the industrial front, they have a lot more growth built into it than even our retail leases doing. So, the same store rent numbers should actually on a normalized basis, whereas I would expect it to go up. Not down.\nWes Golladay: Gotcha. And then, made this early but I was curious about the potential office spin off how the capital structure would look and what that would mean for O's proforma leverage?\nSumit Roy: We are absolutely focused on maintaining our A three A minus rating. And I believe the rating agencies came out and re-established, the ratings as well as the outlook post the announcement, we made last week and we are very much focused that proforma for the spend, we will continue to maintain ratings because even proforma for the spend, the proforma company is going to be close to $50 billion in size. And we'll have leverage metrics that is equivalent, if not better than what where we are today. So, it is super important for us to maintain our ratings.\nWes Golladay: Got it. Thank you. Well.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Linda Tsai from Jeffries.\nChristie Kelly: Hi Linda.\nLinda Tsai: Hello, Christie. Hi, Sumit. Maybe following up on your earlier comment that you can handle and welcome large acquisition volumes. For this quarter you sourced $20 billion and invested in 5%. Does this 5% or $1 billion executed to $20 billion sourced ratio remain consistent post-merger?\nSumit Roy: I hope it gets enhanced. I think I said this last week, and does that where VEREIT has been spending a fair amount of their time is not exactly 100% of an overlap of where we spend our time. So, we would like to be able to continue to leverage their platform and their ability to play in a zip code that we haven't spent a lot of time because, we're finding plenty of opportunities in the areas that we would really want to focus on. So, my hope is that pro forma for the combination, that the platform will increase in size and the area of focus will increase. And therefore, we might be able to create a trend line that is a step up from where we are today. But that is down the road. I want to stay focus on where we are today and the platform that we have currently. And if you look at the ratio of what gets closed versus what gets source, we have generally been in this 4% to 7%to 8% zip code for many quarters now. I mean, have there been quarters where those numbers may have been higher or slightly lower, perhaps, but it's generally in the zip code and we have the infrastructure to absolutely deal with that volume, and deal with getting our share of that volume over the finish line. And we haven't remained stagnant. That's the other point. I know, that's not very obvious from the outside, our team has grown. We have a complete platform now in the UK, which is in addition to the platform that we have in the U.S., which didn't exist. So, the platform has continued to grow, to absorb this higher volume of analysis that that is being asked of this team. So, so far, so good.\nLinda Tsai: Thanks. And then my second question is with G&A at about 4.5%. Do you have a sense of how low this could go maybe a few years out post-merger?\nSumit Roy: We talked about the G&A synergies in that $45 million to $50 million, and a cash synergy is in 35 to 40. I think there's some analysis that the team has done, where we show you that the journey to gross asset value potentially drops by one-third, going from 33 basis points to 23 basis points or 22 basis points. And, that is the goal. We absolutely believe in that, that the larger our platform becomes, the more scalable it is, and therefore it should translate to G&A numbers continuing to go down. But how far down does it go? I can't tell you. It's also going to be a function of, do we continue to add new swim lanes? If we do, we need the infrastructure to help support that. And if it keeps our G&A elevated, because we're still not reaching this normalized level of what this business and platform is capable of doing, I'm totally fine having a G&A in the course. But on a normalized level. If we have exhausted all possible swim lanes, then who knows that this thing can go? I don't have a precise answer for your Linda.\nLinda Tsai: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Massocca from Ladenburg Thalmann.\nChristie Kelly: Hey, John.\nJohn Massocca: Good afternoon. How's it going?\nSumit Roy: Good. How are you?\nJohn Massocca: Just a quick one from me, outside of office, how much roughly speaking of the VEREIT portfolio do you view as being a target for capital recycling as you look to manage the portfolio?\nSumit Roy: I think I've answered this question in a different way, in terms of how much did we like the industrial and the retail portfolio that will be part of remain comp [ph] going forward? We don't see their makeup being largely different from ours, except in the areas that they've chosen to focus on. But the more we underwrote those industries and the actual operators that they have exposure to, the more comfortable we got that overall, this portfolio is one that we will be very proud to absorb. So, John, I don't have a precise answer. Could you see a corresponding increase in our capital recycling that we managed through disposition? You could, but that would be more of a function of the size of the platform has just increased rather than it getting disproportionately larger, because there's a lot more assets on their side that we would want to recycle that. Time will tell, but I suspect that it will be commensurate with what we are established as a standalone company today.\nJohn Massocca: Okay. All my other questions have been answered. So that's it for me. Thank you.\nSumit Roy: Thank you, John.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein from Bank of America.\nChristie Kelly: Hey, Josh.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Hey Christie, hope you're doing well. Curious how you think about Europe now that you're a larger entity, just split the $2 billion mark over in UK. Are you thinking of kind of accelerating one of the portions to the rest of Europe at this time, or there are some other hurdles that you do look into [Indiscernible]?\nSumit Roy: You know, Josh, that's a very good question. And I do want to answer it. What we were planning on doing on a standalone basis has absolutely not changed because of the announcement we made last week. I don't believe that it accelerates our desire to go into the rest of Europe, just because of this particular merger. Our desire to go to other geographies and other markets are largely being driven by our underwriting, our ability to absorb new markets, the team that we have in place, the maturity of our understanding of these various different markets. That's what's driving our desires. And so, yes, could we do more because the scale benefits of absorbing $15 billion platform? The answer is absolutely, yes. We can do more. And so, I think that's where the benefit comes. But I don't think, trying new things is triggered by the fact that we have a large platform off of which to try it. So, I just wanted to make that nuanced point, Josh. But it was a great question. And I'm glad you asked.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Great, I appreciate it. That's it from me.\nSumit Roy: Thank you, Josh.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your next question comes from Harsh Hemnani from Green Street.\nChristie Kelly: Hi Harsh.\nHarsh Hemnani: Hi. Hey Sumit, you mentioned that you're looking to grow the development side of the business, as far as looking at the initial use on those this quarter, they were roughly equal the yields on acquisition. I'm just trying to understand the spread over your cost of capital that you see on the acquisition side versus what you're aiming towards on the development side long term.\nSumit Roy: Yeah, Harsh, very good question. But again, it's a function of the mix, where the development dollars are going. If it is going towards industrial assets, which you will see that it is, the vast majority of the capital is going towards takeouts. And those cap rates, if they have a 5 in front of them, that's a great outcome. Because guess what happens once these assets are fully developed, and you go out into the open market, and you try to buy it from the open market, it potentially has a low 4s, even a 3 handled in front it. And that is the reason why we feel like yes, these cap rates, headline cap rates may look low. But if you really dive in behind the numbers, and you try to figure out what is the product that they're being able to get through this development funding, takeout funding, whatever you want to call it versus what could they buy the same particular asset, if it were available today, there is still 100 basis points, maybe 50 basis points, if you want to be conservative optimist, that we are getting by partnering with some of these very well-established global developers. So that's really where the value creation is. To answer your question more specifically what do I see the yield on development. If you look at retail, when you look at retail development, it depends on whether it's a repositioning or a Greenfield or what hasn't. On repositioning, that's where the maximum value creation occurs, we already have the piece of land, we go down the path of creating or repositioning an asset with the expectation that, you know, an AI through some of these numbers out at you that we could have ran compared to the privy positioning of 150, 200 even 300 - or 300 percentages of points. So that's the kind of uplift in value we could generate through this. Now that is a small portion of our business, a very small portion. But I just want to put in perspective that you see a blended number, but if you go behind the number there is a fair amount of value creation. And largely we want to be viewed as a one stop shop by our tenants who know us as landlords that hold assets for the long term. And if we can help them, harness our vacant asset portfolio by repositioning it for their needs. We want to be there to serve them. And that's the reason for having this. But in terms of how big is it going to become? What is the trend line going to look like? It's going to be a function of what dominates in that one given quarter.\nHarsh Hemnani: That's interesting. And then one more for me, on the debt synergies from the very first deal. Given that you have a lower cost of capital in the UK, could we expect to see a higher leverage ratio on your UK assets than in the U.S.?\nSumit Roy: No, again, it goes back to our ratings Harsh. If you want a guiding principle, look at our balance sheet on a fully consolidated basis. And we want to be right down the fairway which keeps our rating agencies very happy. Yeah, that allows us the maximum flexibility to run our business. But we do not want to do anything that's going to compromise our A minus A 3 rating. Now, the mix of where that comes from, could absolutely change. A lot more of it could come from the UK, given the ARB between a tenuous Sterling denominated unsecured bond versus a U.S. unsecured bond. And we may choose again just to match fund our assets with locally denominated capital, we may choose to over lever some of those assets. But there is a threshold beyond which we are not going to go, even on a standalone basis. But yes, we can certainly have more of a mix coming from the UK given the lower cost there than the U.S. And then if you look at it on a fully consolidated basis, it's going to have the same profile that you would expect of an A 3 A minus rated company. I hope that answers your question.\nHarsh Hemnani: That's helpful. Thank you.\nChristie Kelly: Thanks, Harsh.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income's conference call.

We're the only net lease REIT from the S&P 500, one of the top 10 largest U.S. REITs by enterprise value and the largest company in the net lease REIT sector. Upon closing our recently announced merger with VEREIT, Realty Income is expected to be the sixth largest REIT in the [ph] RMZ in terms of equity market capitalization. Our size and scale, in conjunction with our conservative balance sheets and financial strength have afforded us to a credit rating by the major rating agencies and our $3 billion multi-currency revolver grants us ample access to well-priced capital that allows us to opportunistically raise permanent long-term capital when the markets are most favorable. During the quarter, we raised approximately $670 million through an overnight equity offering to reduce our financing risk by pre-funding our active global investment pipeline. In January 2021, we completed the early redemption of all $950 million, 3.25% notes due in 2022 to take advantage of attractive borrowing rates in the fixed income market, while reducing our near-term financing risks. This redemption was primarily funded through our December issuance of $725 million of senior unsecured notes through a dual tranche offering of a five year and 12-year note, which achieved record low U.S. dollar coupon rates in the REIT sector for each of those tenors. As a result, our fixed charge coverage ratio, I'm pleased to report, has hit an all-time high at 5.8 times this quarter. We believe funding our business with approximately two-thirds equity and one-third debt contributes to maintaining a conservative balance sheet. We ended the quarter with net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 5.3 times or 5.2 times on a proforma basis, adjusting for the annualized impact of acquisitions and dispositions during the quarter. And our near-term debt maturities remain minimal, with only $26 million of debt maturing through year end 2021 excluding our commercial paper program and borrowings outstanding on our revolving credit facility. At the end of the first quarter, we had full availability of our $3 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility, $675 million outstanding under our $1 billion commercial paper program, and over $184 million of cash on hand, providing approximately $2.5 billion of liquidity available to capitalize on our active global investment pipeline. During the quarter, our business generated $0.86 cents of AFFO per share and we are maintaining our 2021 AFFO per share guidance of $3.44 to $3.49 on a standalone Realty Income basis unadjusted for the expected merger. Remember, we currently have 37 of our 79 Theater assets on cash accounting. These 37 theaters represent about $25.5 million dollars of annual rent remaining in 2021. And we've reserved $33.2 million as allowance for bad debt on these assets, net of $1.9 million of straight-line rent receivables. In total, this $58.7 million translates to approximately $0.15 that is not currently included in AFFO per share guidance. We are encouraged by the recent momentum in the theatre space, such as increased nationwide opening and the release of blockbuster films. Most recently, Godzilla versus Cong brought in approximately $49 million during the opening weekend, five days specifically Wednesday to Sunday, and generated more than $390 million in revenue within the first two weeks of its global release, turning a profit of more than $200 million. However, until we are confident these particular theaters can continue to pay us contractual rent. We will continue to recognize revenue for these 37 theatres on a cash basis. As the monthly dividend company, we would be remiss not to discuss the dividends when providing business results. In April, we declared our 610th consecutive monthly dividends and we now increase the dividend 110 times since our listing in the New York Stock Exchange in 1994. Since 1994, we have increased the dividend every year growing dividends per share at a compound average annual growth rate of approximately 4.4%. And as a result of increasing the dividend every year for the past 25 consecutive years, we are proud to be a member of the exclusive S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index which consists of only three REIT and 65 companies overall. I would now like to hand our call back to Sumit. And Ronald, this is Christie. The only thing I would add to Sumit's comments is just a reminder to the team that's on the line is that, our theater portfolio is really high quality. There's over 80% of the theaters in our portfolio that are in the top two core piles of each of the operator's footprint. And as Sumit mentioned AMC is open, but it limited capacity right now and Regal Theaters will be opening towards the end of May. And to that point, we're cautiously remain cautiously optimistic. But there's one thing I want to point out that, when we take a look at the momentum, as it relates to the collection rate in theaters, it's steady and improving. So, stabilize from year end, we were about 10% collection and then throughout the quarter, we've gained some momentum to build towards 16%. And so, we'll look forward to recording more when we come to the second quarter. Thanks, Caitlin. Thanks Rob. Hi Brent. Good. How are you, Brent? Hi Linda. Hey, John. Hey, Josh. Hi Harsh. Thanks, Harsh."

            "name": "Sumit Roy",
            "content": "Thanks, Julie. Welcome, everyone. The continued strength of our business is made possible by the incredible partnerships we have with all stakeholders. I would like to express my gratitude and appreciation to our Realty Income team who continues to effectively execute our strategic objectives while enduring a sustained, remote work environment. As we've announced last week, we are excited to have reached a definitive merger agreement with VEREIT, which would further distance ourselves as a leader in the net lease industry and create a company with a combined enterprise value of approximately $50 billion. We believe shareholders of both companies will enjoy meaningful value creation through immediate earnings accretion and expanded platform with enhanced size, scale and diversification, driving further growth opportunities, and strategic and financing synergies which are enhanced by Realty Income's A rated balance sheet and access to well-priced capital. We are very excited about the strategic transaction and look forward to continuing to drive future growth together as a combined enterprise. However, today we will focus on what was a very successful first quarter for Realty Income. Our first quarter results illustrate our ability to grow through a variety of swim lanes afforded to us by our size and scale by completing over $1 billion in acquisitions. Notably, in this quarter, we invested approximately $403 million in high quality real estate in the UK, highlighting the continued strength of our international platform and bringing that total investment in the UK to over $2 billion since the first international acquisitions we closed in 2019. Domestically, we invested $625 million in real estate, including our first ever acquisition in Hawaii, becoming the first and only REIT to own property in all US states. Our accomplishments during the quarter continue to demonstrate the momentum in our business, and highlight our ability to leverage our size and scale to drive our business forward in pursuit of sustainable growth. On the subject of sustainable growth, our team continues to make tremendous progress through our ESG initiative, as ESG considerations continue to permeate throughout our organization at every level. In April, we published our inaugural Sustainability Report, which details our company's commitments, goals and progress to-date with regard to environmental, social, and government initiatives. I invite all Realty Income stakeholders to share in our dedication to embrace the changing world for the benefit of all those we serve. And I encourage everyone listening to read our 2020 Sustainability Report found on the corporate responsibility page of our website. Additionally, we are excited to share an updated investor presentation to the marketplace. On the homepage of our website, you can find our new deck, which highlights our fundamental business philosophies, key competitive advantages, and plan for future growth. Turning to results for the quarter, our global investment pipeline remains a significant driver of growth for our business. Our business is simple. We seek to acquire high quality real estate lease to leading operators in economically resilient industries in pursuit of stable and increasing cash flow generation. Our confidence in continuing to grow our platform stems from the quality of our real estate portfolio, which is designed for resiliency through a variety of economic environments. Key to mitigating economic risk, we believe in portfolio diversification by geography, client, industry and property type as we continue to grow our real estate portfolio. In the first quarter of 2021, we invested over $1 billion in high quality real estate and we remain very comfortable with our 2021 acquisition guidance of over $3.25 billion. On a total revenue basis, approximately 39% of total acquisitions during the quarter are leased to investment grade rated clients, which brings our total investment grade client exposure for the portfolio to approximately 50%. Aligning with our equals, the weighted average remaining lease term of the assets added to our portfolio during the quarter was 12.6 years. And at the end of the quarter, the weighted average lease term of our total portfolio was 8.9 years. As at quarter end, our real estate portfolio includes over 600 clients who operate in 56 different industries. Approximately 84% of rental revenue comes from our traditional retail properties, while industrial properties generated about 11% of rental revenue. With regard to our retail business, we seek to invest in industries with a service non-discretionary and or low price point component of the business, as we believe these characteristics make for economically resilient operation that can more effectively compete with e-commerce. As such of our acquisitions during the quarter, the largest industry represented were grocery stores. Walgreens remains our largest client at 5.5% of rental revenue, and convenience stores remain our largest industry at 12% of rental revenue. Our investment philosophy primarily focuses on acquiring freestanding single unit commercial properties leased to best-in-class clients under long-term net lease agreements typically in excess of 10 years. We believe the market is efficient. As such, we've seen a competitive environment for high quality assets leased to strong operators. Cap rates, as you all know, reflect an aggregation of many factors including but not limited to fundamental real estate economics, lease term, credit of the client or their sponsor, rent relative to the market, average rent coverage by the operator and alternative use of the real estate. Accordingly, the quality of our acquisitions is reflected in our average initial cash cap rate during the first quarter of 5.3%. Our size and scale allow us to be highly selective in pursuing investment opportunities that fit our stringent criteria. This quarter we sourced nearly $20 billion of transaction opportunities, ultimately investing in approximately 5% of the prospects sourced and reviewed. Additionally, our cost of capital allows us to invest accretively even when pursuing the highest quality assets. During the first quarter our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were 115 basis points. The quality of the assets we acquire flows through the entire lifecycle of our portfolio, allowing us to basically recapture rent on expiring leases and maintain a healthy level of occupancy. During the quarter, we re-leased 54 units, re-capturing 103.5% of expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have executed over 3600 re-leases or sales on expiring leases, re-capturing over 100% of rent on those re-leased contracts, and occupancy at quarter end was 98%. Our size and scale afford us the ability to execute large scale sale leaseback transactions which are often sourced through existing partnerships with best-in-class clients, but also serve as an attractive way to establish new relationships. The transaction we closed in Hawaii is an excellent example of the sale leaseback opportunities we can execute. In this instance, we partnered with Par Petroleum to acquire 22 well located convenience stores for approximately $116 million. All 22 properties fall under one triple net master lease agreement with an initial 15-year lease term. And all assets are located in many main locations, primarily on the island of O'ahu. This quarter, about 24% of all acquisitions we close were executed as sale leaseback transactions. The merger between Realty Income and VEREIT will enhance our ability to execute large scale leaseback transactions through expanded capacity to buy in bulk, which improve our competitive positioning when competing for portfolio or sale leaseback transactions in the fragmented net lease industry. As we have previously articulated, the ability to buy at wholesale prices and at a discount to the one-off market is a competitive advantage. We are often one of only a handful of buyers for large scale portfolio transactions, particularly those that would otherwise create untenable client or industry concentration issues for our competitors. Proforma for the closing of the transaction, we will have approximately $2.5 billion of annualized rental revenue. For every $1 billion of acquisition to a single creditor industry, our exposure to that creditor industry will increase by approximately 2% compared to around 3.5% based on our current size. By leveraging our size and scale, we continue to effectively execute through our international platform. We have healthy acquisition volume in the UK. Fundamentally, we are replicating our U.S. business strategy, seeking to curate a high-quality real estate portfolio leased to leading operators in economically resilient industries. Our total first quarter acquisition volume improved approximately $403 million of international acquisitions in the UK, which brings us total investment volume to more than $2 billion since the first transaction we closed in the UK in 2019. Our International pipeline has accelerated even more quickly than originally anticipated. This quarter's International acquisition volume represents nearly 40% of our total investment volume during the quarter. A figure that is truly incremental to the U.S. business and one that we expect to grow. Now I'll pass it over to Christie to provide financial updates. Thank you, Christie. Our first quarter results continue to highlight the incredible opportunities afforded to us by our size and scale, which uniquely position us to be the global consolidator in a highly fragmented net leased space. And we believe the very merger will enhance our positioning to be just that. Our positive results as well as our powerful business momentum and in strong outlook energize our talented team to continue expanding our existing verticals, while finding new swim lanes through which the business can grow. At this time, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator? That's certainly an area that we spent a fair amount of time focusing on Greg, when we were looking at VEREIT. The biggest contributor to that 7% is Red Lobster. And looking at where Red Lobster is today versus even where it was a year ago, gave us a fair amount of confidence that Red Lobster has turned the corner from being privately equity owned to being owned by a company out of Thailand Thai Union. And the credit enhancements that it achieved, the results that it is now posting, the fact that it gave --that it paid 100% of the rent in the fourth quarter to VEREIT. All of that gave us confidence that it's turned the corner and being vertically integrated organization, such as Thai Union is made us feel like 7% is a number that we can live with. But the goal here Greg will be over time to continue to reduce that, just like we did with our casual dining concept which used to be in the high single digits. And today represent less than 3% of our overall registry. And that will be the goal with on a proforma basis being up to 7% continuing to reduce that back down into the low single digits. Yeah, there's a bunch of questions you've asked there, Greg. The question is, we've talked about how proforma for this acquisition, it allows us to pursue larger transactions. I will say that you don't have multibillion dollar transactions coming in every week. But when you do, they can be a step growth, opportunity, just like a consolidation is in our industry. But given our size today, doing a multibillion-dollar transaction, we were somewhat constrained, pursuing that even if it checked all the other boxes, i.e. we like the credit, we like the operator, we like the industry, we like the makeup of the real estate, we like the rent composition, et cetera, et cetera. You feel constrained, just given how much of your portfolio concentration gets impacted by a single tenant. But once you start to increase your platform, the ability to absorb larger transactions, when they present themselves, certainly enhances. And there have been opportunities and I don't want to get into details, when even in the past 12 months, there have been opportunities to pursue transactions, where given, everything that we have relationship, to check the boxes across the spectrum we were still constrained by the allocation that we had to be able to pursue this particular transaction single-handedly. And those are the types of constraints that do get alleviated, the larger your platform becomes. And it does allow you to be able to present yourself as a one stop shop for some of these very well capitalized businesses that you want to continue to be their one stop shop, which we have been in this one example that I'm referencing. So, yeah, I do think that, post this consolidation, that it will enhance our position to pursue transactions that we were, somewhat constrained to do so in our current size and scale. Hi Katy. Kate, it's been three business days since we made the announcement. But thank you for asking the question. Yeah, look, we've been pleasantly surprised by the inbounds. We're still in the process of collecting those inbounds and trying to figure out what's real from what's not real? We have been very clear that the path that we control is the spin off path. To answer your question more directly, it's essentially all of our office assets along with the vast majority of the of the VEREIT office assets outside of the six assets that are constrained by a CMBS pool, which is cross collateralized across multiple asset types. So outside of the six, our goal would be to basically spin off all of the remaining assets, which is right around 97 properties, $182 million $183 million in rent, weighted average lease term circa 4, 76% 77% investment grade tenants. That's the makeup of the portfolio. But as we had thought would happen, once we announced there have been inbound calls, we are just gathering the information, but it is still too early to tell what's real from what's not. We are going to continue down the path that we control. And if something were to happen in the meantime, that's great. But it's too early to tell. Yeah, Katy, it's just, it's not something we intentionally pursued in this particular quarter. We've always, two CEOs ago, Tom was from Hawaii. And the inside joke was how come we don't have any properties there. Now, Jonathan Png is our resident Hawaiian. And the joke has continued, but it really was the function of the bright opportunity presenting itself at the right time with a partner that we liked, we underwrote their business, we underwrote their performance, we underwrote their locations, it was just the right time at the right place. And it just so happened that it closed in the first quarter. There wasn't any grand design to be able to come out and make the kinds of announcements that we have done. We've been very opportunistic, very lucky in some ways, and very grateful to now be able to say that we are in 50 states, but that to us was not as important as finding the right transaction. And this particular transaction that allowed us to go to Hawaii certainly checks all the boxes. So, we're very grateful for that. Sure, Ronald, thank you for your question. Look, our watch list is right around 5%. And it's the biggest contributor to that watch list is the theater business. So, they are very much tied. And our collection is also largely a function of the collection in the theater business. We feel you asked me to give you a reference point as to how we feel about a theatre business today versus when we first got into the pandemic, we feel a lot better today than we did then. There have been actual examples here in the U.S., which were preceded by examples playing out in China and in Japan, which lend credence to the hypothesis that we had, that the theater business once the contents was starting to get released and the social distancing norms were relaxed, the theater business was going to be able to bounce back. That piece has largely proven out to be the case, Ronald. I mean, if you look at the only one example that we currently have of a big blockbuster movie that came out, which was the Godzilla versus Kong. In the first five days, it generated right around $49 million. We've been tracking how it has done subsequent to that as well. And it's right in that high 80 right around $90 million is the collection here in the U.S. theaters. If you look at it globally, it's close to $390 million. And the budget to make that movie was right around $180 million $190 million. So, $200 million roughly largely being gathered through the theater release. And that just continues to lay credence to that as content starts to come in, as these theaters are allowed to open, AMC is largely open here in the U.S. Regal is still not. Regal is still targeting mid to late May, to open up all of its theaters. And so, we do believe that this connection is going to become a function of the theaters opening. And based on the discussions that we've had with our operators, we continue to feel very optimistic that in the near term, those collection numbers will start to go up. But look, we're also blessed with a balance sheet, to lend grace to some of these operators, as long as we believe that their operating model is going to come through and it's going to be a viable business model going forward. And we genuinely believe that the theatre industry, and specifically these two operators are going to be viable operators going forward. And so, if we have the ability to lend our balance sheet, give them a little bit more grace, in terms of stabilizing their operating business model, that's what we've done. And we feel very good about that decision. Yeah, Ronald we've got 3500 properties that has been constructed over the last 11 years, since they became public. Clearly there are areas of the portfolio, one of which we touched on, has turned the corner. But it wasn't something that we would have pursued in isolation six years ago when they when they chose to do that transaction. But by and large, I would say we were pleasantly surprised when we underwrote all of their assets, all of their operators at the quality of the portfolio they had, and there was an art to be making, for whatever reason, and we're grateful, because it allowed us to create a lot of value for our business, that they were trading at a massive discount to what we believe is the inherent value, especially of their retail and industrial portfolio. And so, the other point I would like to highlight is the fact that they are complementary to our focus. This is why, things like convenience stores which we are big fans of with certain operators I want to qualify allows us to go from 12% to 9% proforma for the combination. It allows us to take our grocery from 10% to 8%, because they don't have those allocations in their portfolio. And so that certainly helps us create additional capacity plus on the theater business, they didn't have much of an exposure. So that allows us to bring down our theater exposure from 5.7% 5.6% to 3.8%, which is starting to get closer to the optimal adaptation that we have been talking about over the last couple of quarters. So, pleasantly surprised on the upside, which is one of the main reasons why we decided to move forward. And we're so grateful that we found a like-minded person and Glenn and his management team to move forward with a transaction that we genuinely believe is a win-win for both parties. So, yeah, super happy to absorb that retail and industrial portfolio into the proforma Realty Income business. Hi Haendel. Yeah. So, Haendel quarter-over-quarter these numbers are going to vary and it is largely a function of the mix. If you're going to be heavily industrial focus, the cap rates are going to be on the lower end. If you're going to be more retail focus, it will be on the higher end. I'm making general comments. Obviously, there are exceptions to even to what I just said. But if you look at what drove the UK cap rate, it was largely two industrial transactions that we did with the same seller that we have a very good relationship with. One was an industrial asset in the Greater London area, highly sought clearly a last mile location and we got it at a cap rate we felt very comfortable owning this particular asset. Another one was in the suburbs of Birmingham; you know that it's leased to a single a credit. Again, fantastic distribution center below market rents. Something that we feel like is going to be super additive to our portfolio going forward. And that's what really drove the cap rate to where it was. Had we excluded those two, our cap rate would have been closer to where we did our fourth quarter UK transactions, which was, I believe, if I remember correctly, 5.6 5.7 cap rate. So, it really is going to be a function of mix, it's going to be a function of which geography dominates, et cetera, et cetera. But I don't think you should expect the cap rate we posted in the first quarter to be the new norm. I would still say that we should average right in that mid 5s to do slightly above that, that would be the goal. And in quarters where we do some more higher yielding stocks, because it's things that we found that the people are not focused on yet, we could see a potential 6. But it really is going to be a function of a mix, it's going to be a function of asset type, lease term, geography, all of those things that go into defining what a quarter cap rate signifies. But I think the bigger point here is, this is the second quarter in a row where we've done a billion dollars. And I've seen a lot of numbers coming out talking about Oh, in order for them to get to the high single digit growth rate, they're going to have to do $4 billion of acquisition. We welcome that challenge. In fact, we are excited about that challenge. And we've already talked about what creating these new verticals for us, new markets growth for us has done to our sourcing numbers, which is not translating into actual [ph] clothes. So, for us, the numbers being posted, yes, for most net lease businesses that's a staggering number. But for us, it's something that we welcome, and we also agree with the market that it is for us to show to you that we are capable of doing this on a quarter after quarter after quarter basis. So that's where the fun part is for us and the team. We look forward to that challenge. And we look forward to posting numbers with assets that doesn't compromise what we have said is our risk profile. And that's the key message here, that we are doing all of this. And we are growing our platform and we are growing our portfolio with the right type of industries, right operators, right geographies, right growth rates, all of the things that we create sustained value over the long term. So, I know you didn't quite ask that. But I just wanted to make sure that we output the answer on cap rates in context to what it is that we are trying to do. And the sustainability of what it is that we're trying to do. So, forgive me for that Haendel. Haendel, one of the things that will distinguish this team, I think, and I believe in, is the fact that we will always remain humble. If data is changing on the ground, if trends are changing, we're constantly trying to mark the market. But what we don't want to do is over index to any near-term phenomenon, just like we didn't over index to the fact that, hey, the theater business and the health and fitness business really took a took a beating in an environment where you have social distancing requirements. And does that mean we should go down to zero in both those businesses? The answer is no. And so, what we are trying to figure out is, what are the trends, especially given the long-term nature of the leases that we enter into, what is the trend long term that we are going to underwrite to? And just because something creates a potential opportunity near term, if we can't get comfortable with the long-term prospects, we will largely stay away from those types of situations. Now that doesn't mean we don't get a few things wrong. And in hindsight, we don't go back saying, Oh, we should have made that a different way, because our conclusion was inaccurate. But we, I believe, have gotten more things right than wrong. And that has served us well. So, the answer to your question is, without getting into specifics that we are constantly trying to upgrade our pieces to reflect what's on the ground. But we don't try to over index to it without taking into consideration with the long-term impacts of those immediate trends that we're seeing. I'll throw something out there, which is the exact opposite of what you're suggesting. I think there is an opportunity in the office sector. Now, are we going to go into the office sector? No, there's a reason why we said we are going to be spinning off all of our office assets. But I do believe that given the environment today, and given how negative the sentiment is around the office asset type, there is value to be had. If somebody is willing to take a longer-term perspective on what is office going to look like. And that's the reason why we want to create a spin off if that is the route, we end up eventually evacuating. We want to set it up for success. And it is a play on what we have seen near term. And then it's forecasting out that trendline to see what do you think it's going to happen to Office five, seven, 10 years from now? Where do we see growth? Yes, growth? I use that word with Office. Where do we see opportunities? And, there is an argument to be made that that could play out so Time will tell. Yeah, I'm not going to talk about specifics Haendel. And you've always asked me very specific questions, and I've tried to stay away from it. You asked me about M&A. And I did M&A for you now. No, no, stay away from specifics Haendel. Thank you though. Yes, very good questions, Caitlin. Thank you. I should have actually completed my answer on the UK, giving a little bit more color on the structuring side of the equation. So, we went into the UK recognizing that there's going to be an associated track tax leakage. And when we underwrite transactions, we take into account what is our effective tax rate? What is the statutory tax rate? What's the effective tax rate? How much are we really making in terms of actual spreads, et cetera, et cetera. And of course, comparing it to the cost of capital, which is also much lower in the UK. And seeing if it's if it made sense. It made a lot of sense. And by and large, I think we are tracking to the effective tax rates that we had shared with the market two years ago in April of 2019. What I would like to add Caitlin is, there is a change that is being contemplated, that would actually increase the statutory tax rate in the UK market. But what we have been exploring and hopefully we'll be able to implement in the near term is restructuring our Realty Income limited the legal entity that that is house there where we will actually end up potentially saving 400 basis points off of our effective tax rate. So, do you expect to see this this the taxes being paid in the UK continuing to go up? Absolutely, you should. But not at the same rate as you have seen over the last three years. We are getting more efficient. We are structuring our transactions going forward in a manner where we are actually going to see on an effective basis and decrease in the tax leakage associated with our investments. And we are constantly looking at how we're going to be financing this transaction, and does it still make sense? And the answer is a resounding yes, it does. And that's the reason why we're continuing to do what we're doing. That's an opinion. I'll let you conclude that for yourself, but I do think Christie mentioned as to the 37 assets that are on cash accounting, so, so much of the improvement that could play out in the future has not been sort of reflected in the guidance that we have shown, but nor have we changed our cash accounting on those 37 assets. So, we really, if you want to use the word conservative, fine, we just really want to see actual collections go back up to levels that warrant a change in our thesis around cash accounting versus not. And then that would certainly translate to higher AFFO per share trend lines. But we tend to be a little bit more deliberate. And, yes, things are looking very optimistic. But until it's not actually starting to reflect in enclosed monthly statements, we're going to stay the course. And, obviously, what we have and the reason why we haven't adjusted is for the merger is because first and foremost, there are conditions involved. And even if this were to close, it won't happen to the fourth quarter, which clearly will have a very minimal impact this year. And so, for those reasons, we have kept the guidance, exactly the same. We want to digest what we just announced last week. We also want to get another quarter under our belt, and then we revisit earnings at the end of the second quarter. And share with you what our latest thoughts are on that. We are very comfortable executing exactly the same business model that we have. We have always said that, if you want to run a business 100% occupancy we can. But that is not value optimizing solution. And the reason why we have also shared with the market, our real estate operations team as is the largest in the company is to be able to do the things that we want to do. That is the reason why we have always said that 98% is the right occupancy level for us because we are going to be repositioning assets where we can create, and these numbers get buried, but 140% 170% recapture rates on rent just because of these repositioning that we are able to do but yes, it takes time and yes, that means more, you're sitting on more non-occupied assets. But we are very comfortable doing that, if that is the right economic solution to do so. And just to put things in perspective, that 131 was 140 at the end of the fourth quarter, because we got 65 of our NPC assets back. And the team was able to not only absorb the first quarter explorations, but make a dent and a pretty good one on those assets that were handed back in the NPC transaction. I am super comfortable with the team that we have and the asset management team that is led by TJ, they are a phenomenal group. And what we would like to be able to do is when we absorb VEREIT, is to be able to implement the same business model, which is a reason why we think we want to hold on to a lot of their folks and potentially share our business model with them, and tried to generate the same types of results that we've been able to generate on a standalone basis. That is another area that we can enhance through this combination. Rob, I missed the key word, because there was a big beep. What is it that you said that we need to keep forward? And it's a very small part of our business? It's that. Yeah. Very good question. We hope to grow that business. It's about a $200 million business today. And you're absolutely right, that's not very large compared to the balance sheet that we have. But, some of the repositioning's I alluded to, some of the relationships that we have with existing industrial clients who want expansion capabilities, some of the relationships that we are developing with developers to provide a capital source, that could be a takeout, all of that is incredibly valuable to us. And I would love to see with a bigger platform, make this 3X 4X or what it is today, and being another contributor of value to our business. And so, we have a team that we have continued to grow, and through this combination, we will potentially grow this team even more, so that we can continue to enhance value going forward, even while just working on our own existing assets. And going back to your previous question working on vacant assets or soon to be vacant assets, and doing repositioning. That requires an enhanced expertise in the development front. So, we will certainly hold on to it and grow it. And potentially grow the allocation from where it is today. Brent we are very optimistic. We, to be very honest with you, we are not seeing anything, we are obviously following some of the same rules coming out of DC and how it is going to have an impact et cetera. We are not seeing any of that translate into the volume being sourced. And our belief in not only meeting but potentially exceeding what we have shared with the market as our acquisition target. We started the year. And I think, Brent, if you recall, when we came into January, we shared with you what our pipeline looks like and how optimistic we were, that optimism has just continued to grow. So, we are super excited about not just the sheer volume but the quality that we are seeing and the quality that we are being able to get over the finish line. So, the platform is working. Sure. We've certainly seen a couple of trades on the health and fitness side, especially with the more established operators. We've seen a few vacant assets on the theater side sell. So yes, people are getting much more optimistic about the future and are willing to buy vacant pieces of land with a building and reposition it. And that optimism is starting to filter in into the acquisition arena. But that's not an area that we play in. But it's certainly it's certainly something that's seen. Yeah, Wes, it's largely driven by this one asset that we had incorrectly calculated the CPI adjustment to it. And when we realized our mistake, and of course, we had collected rent on that. We went back to our clients and we shared with them that look, there was a mistake. And we gave them all - we readjusted the rent going forward. And that's really what you're starting to see play out. And so, obviously the client was incredibly happy about us coming out and sharing this information. But that's really what you're seeing play out. If you look at the actual leases on the industrial front, they have a lot more growth built into it than even our retail leases doing. So, the same store rent numbers should actually on a normalized basis, whereas I would expect it to go up. Not down. We are absolutely focused on maintaining our A three A minus rating. And I believe the rating agencies came out and re-established, the ratings as well as the outlook post the announcement, we made last week and we are very much focused that proforma for the spend, we will continue to maintain ratings because even proforma for the spend, the proforma company is going to be close to $50 billion in size. And we'll have leverage metrics that is equivalent, if not better than what where we are today. So, it is super important for us to maintain our ratings. I hope it gets enhanced. I think I said this last week, and does that where VEREIT has been spending a fair amount of their time is not exactly 100% of an overlap of where we spend our time. So, we would like to be able to continue to leverage their platform and their ability to play in a zip code that we haven't spent a lot of time because, we're finding plenty of opportunities in the areas that we would really want to focus on. So, my hope is that pro forma for the combination, that the platform will increase in size and the area of focus will increase. And therefore, we might be able to create a trend line that is a step up from where we are today. But that is down the road. I want to stay focus on where we are today and the platform that we have currently. And if you look at the ratio of what gets closed versus what gets source, we have generally been in this 4% to 7%to 8% zip code for many quarters now. I mean, have there been quarters where those numbers may have been higher or slightly lower, perhaps, but it's generally in the zip code and we have the infrastructure to absolutely deal with that volume, and deal with getting our share of that volume over the finish line. And we haven't remained stagnant. That's the other point. I know, that's not very obvious from the outside, our team has grown. We have a complete platform now in the UK, which is in addition to the platform that we have in the U.S., which didn't exist. So, the platform has continued to grow, to absorb this higher volume of analysis that that is being asked of this team. So, so far, so good. We talked about the G&A synergies in that $45 million to $50 million, and a cash synergy is in 35 to 40. I think there's some analysis that the team has done, where we show you that the journey to gross asset value potentially drops by one-third, going from 33 basis points to 23 basis points or 22 basis points. And, that is the goal. We absolutely believe in that, that the larger our platform becomes, the more scalable it is, and therefore it should translate to G&A numbers continuing to go down. But how far down does it go? I can't tell you. It's also going to be a function of, do we continue to add new swim lanes? If we do, we need the infrastructure to help support that. And if it keeps our G&A elevated, because we're still not reaching this normalized level of what this business and platform is capable of doing, I'm totally fine having a G&A in the course. But on a normalized level. If we have exhausted all possible swim lanes, then who knows that this thing can go? I don't have a precise answer for your Linda. Good. How are you? I think I've answered this question in a different way, in terms of how much did we like the industrial and the retail portfolio that will be part of remain comp [ph] going forward? We don't see their makeup being largely different from ours, except in the areas that they've chosen to focus on. But the more we underwrote those industries and the actual operators that they have exposure to, the more comfortable we got that overall, this portfolio is one that we will be very proud to absorb. So, John, I don't have a precise answer. Could you see a corresponding increase in our capital recycling that we managed through disposition? You could, but that would be more of a function of the size of the platform has just increased rather than it getting disproportionately larger, because there's a lot more assets on their side that we would want to recycle that. Time will tell, but I suspect that it will be commensurate with what we are established as a standalone company today. Thank you, John. You know, Josh, that's a very good question. And I do want to answer it. What we were planning on doing on a standalone basis has absolutely not changed because of the announcement we made last week. I don't believe that it accelerates our desire to go into the rest of Europe, just because of this particular merger. Our desire to go to other geographies and other markets are largely being driven by our underwriting, our ability to absorb new markets, the team that we have in place, the maturity of our understanding of these various different markets. That's what's driving our desires. And so, yes, could we do more because the scale benefits of absorbing $15 billion platform? The answer is absolutely, yes. We can do more. And so, I think that's where the benefit comes. But I don't think, trying new things is triggered by the fact that we have a large platform off of which to try it. So, I just wanted to make that nuanced point, Josh. But it was a great question. And I'm glad you asked. Thank you, Josh. Yeah, Harsh, very good question. But again, it's a function of the mix, where the development dollars are going. If it is going towards industrial assets, which you will see that it is, the vast majority of the capital is going towards takeouts. And those cap rates, if they have a 5 in front of them, that's a great outcome. Because guess what happens once these assets are fully developed, and you go out into the open market, and you try to buy it from the open market, it potentially has a low 4s, even a 3 handled in front it. And that is the reason why we feel like yes, these cap rates, headline cap rates may look low. But if you really dive in behind the numbers, and you try to figure out what is the product that they're being able to get through this development funding, takeout funding, whatever you want to call it versus what could they buy the same particular asset, if it were available today, there is still 100 basis points, maybe 50 basis points, if you want to be conservative optimist, that we are getting by partnering with some of these very well-established global developers. So that's really where the value creation is. To answer your question more specifically what do I see the yield on development. If you look at retail, when you look at retail development, it depends on whether it's a repositioning or a Greenfield or what hasn't. On repositioning, that's where the maximum value creation occurs, we already have the piece of land, we go down the path of creating or repositioning an asset with the expectation that, you know, an AI through some of these numbers out at you that we could have ran compared to the privy positioning of 150, 200 even 300 - or 300 percentages of points. So that's the kind of uplift in value we could generate through this. Now that is a small portion of our business, a very small portion. But I just want to put in perspective that you see a blended number, but if you go behind the number there is a fair amount of value creation. And largely we want to be viewed as a one stop shop by our tenants who know us as landlords that hold assets for the long term. And if we can help them, harness our vacant asset portfolio by repositioning it for their needs. We want to be there to serve them. And that's the reason for having this. But in terms of how big is it going to become? What is the trend line going to look like? It's going to be a function of what dominates in that one given quarter. No, again, it goes back to our ratings Harsh. If you want a guiding principle, look at our balance sheet on a fully consolidated basis. And we want to be right down the fairway which keeps our rating agencies very happy. Yeah, that allows us the maximum flexibility to run our business. But we do not want to do anything that's going to compromise our A minus A 3 rating. Now, the mix of where that comes from, could absolutely change. A lot more of it could come from the UK, given the ARB between a tenuous Sterling denominated unsecured bond versus a U.S. unsecured bond. And we may choose again just to match fund our assets with locally denominated capital, we may choose to over lever some of those assets. But there is a threshold beyond which we are not going to go, even on a standalone basis. But yes, we can certainly have more of a mix coming from the UK given the lower cost there than the U.S. And then if you look at it on a fully consolidated basis, it's going to have the same profile that you would expect of an A 3 A minus rated company. I hope that answers your question. Well, thank you all for joining us today. And we look forward to speaking with each of you soon. Thank you so much. Bye-bye."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Realty Income Fourth quarter 2022 Operating Results Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Julie Hasselwander, Senior Manager of Investor Relations at Realty Income. Please go ahead.\nJulie Hasselwander: Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's fourth quarter operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; Christie Kelly, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Jonathan Pong, Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Finance.  During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company's Form 10-K. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy.\nSumit Roy: Thank you, Julie. Welcome, everyone. 2022 was a year of significant growth for our company. I would like to express my gratitude and appreciation to the Realty Income team, who have worked tirelessly to execute on our strategic objectives and all of our investors for their support. The result of our team's collective efforts was reflected in our 2022 results, highlighted by AFFO per share growth of 9.2%, the highest annual growth rate for our company since 2013. Additionally, we closed on approximately $9 billion of high-quality investments in 2022, including $3.9 billion in the fourth quarter, both the annual and fourth quarter investment volume set record highs for the company. Underpinning investment activity, transaction flow remains robust. We sourced $17 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing 2022 sourcing volume to $95 billion. Finally, we ended the year with occupancy of 99%, our highest occupancy rate at the end of a reporting period in over 20 years. At Realty Income, we strive to provide stability and sustainable growth on behalf of our investors. And during periods of economic uncertainty like we find ourselves in today, the resilience demonstrated by our business model is important to highlight. During our 28-year history as a public company, our combined total return consisting of AFFO per share growth and dividend payments generated by our operations has not experienced a single year of downside volatility in the form of negative total returns. We believe we are in a very limited company among companies in the S&P 500 who can make that claim. This is a testament to the durability of our underlying cash flows, which is supported by a diversified portfolio of properties under long-term leases with clients that are leaders in their respective industries. We are constantly working to incubate new swim lanes for growth that offer attractive risk-adjusted returns. Since the start of 2022, we have expanded our [technical difficulty] new verticals to our platform. In October, we completed our debut transaction in Italy, acquiring seven wholesale clubs operated by Metro AG, an investment-grade pan-European leader in the wholesale club industry. As we discussed in 2019, when we purchased our first property internationally, we are intentional about consolidating the fragmented commercial real estate market in Europe and Italy represents the third country abroad in which we now have a presence. In December, we closed our $1.7 billion acquisition of Encore Boston Harbor resort and Casino from Wynn Resorts, which represent our first transaction in the gaming industry. The property is a good example of our strategy to partner with best-in-class operators to acquire high-quality real estate. It was purchased at a discount to estimated replacement cost, is subject to a long triple net lease of 30 years with attractive annual rent escalators and is located on prime real estate with structural barriers to competition. As anticipated in August 2022, Massachusetts partially legalized professional and collegiate sports wagering for the state, unlocking an estimated $850 million of gross annual gaming revenue and further supporting the strategic importance of this asset. In addition, we are pleased to announce a significant investment in what we are calling the consumer [technical difficulty] through the acquisition of a 224-property portfolio of dental practices during the fourth quarter. We expect this $520 million transaction to be just the start of additional investments we hope to make in a sector that we estimate has a total addressable market in the U.S. of nearly $1.8 trillion in real estate. We believe the consumer-centric medical industry shares many of the same attributes of the nondiscretionary service-based uses that make up much of our portfolio, and that have proven resilient throughout our company's long history. These locations offer essential goods and services in and around the major thoroughfares in which our assets are [technical difficulty] for properties leased to clients in the consumer-centric medical industry is extremely fragmented, which creates consolidation opportunities, we believe we are well suited to address. We believe this industry will continue to move towards a patient-centric model. The trend towards the outpatient model has been ongoing for decades, but we expect this shift to occur in an accelerated fashion post pandemic and will manifest in several ways that support our investment in the industry.  First, the convenience of having care delivered closer to the patient will increase accessibility to the patient and reduce costs for all, including patients, payers and providers. Second, existing clients of ours like Walgreens and CVS will continue to disrupt the status quo as they gain an increasing share of primary care over time. And third, we believe these industry dynamics will help lower the per capita spend on health care in the U.S. and help improve the quality of outcomes. It is also important to note that the adjacency and fungibility of these assets are a strong fit with our existing footprint from a real estate standpoint. As we underwrote this industry, we conducted a study analyzing over 30,000 variables and found that our portfolio had a 90% similarity with a data set of assets in this industry and we look forward to increasing our exposure over time.  Moving on, as we announced earlier this week, actually yesterday, we have entered into a strategic alliance with Plenty, an emerging leader in vertical farms operations to support the development of Plenty's indoor vertical farms. As the initial transaction of the alliance, we will fund the development of an indoor vertical farm asset near Richmond, Virginia, located adjacent to an Amazon distribution facility. Plenty's highly automated farming architecture efficiently harnesses scarce natural resources to generate production yields that it believes are up to 350 times greater per acre than conventional farming. We regard Plenty as the forefront of a structural evolution in crop production and [technical difficulty] growth plans. In summary, these distinct new verticals are representative of the growth opportunities we expect to unlock over time to create value for our shareholders.  Moving on to our portfolio. In addition to our record occupancy at year-end, we are proud to have delivered a rent recapture rate of 103.8% during the fourth quarter on properties renewed or re-leased, bringing our full year recapture rate to 105.9%. We attribute these results to our proactive asset management efforts, the underlying quality of our real estate and our rent levels in the portfolio relative to market. Despite our recent accomplishments, we are still working through the impact of the pending bankruptcy on our Cineworld exposure, which is 1.4% of our total portfolio annualized base rent. As a reminder, -- we own 41 assets, 17 of which are subject to a single master lease agreement and 22 of which have been accounted for under cash basis accounting since the third quarter of 2020. Following the announcement of the Cineworld bankruptcy in September 2022, we have collected 100% of contractual rent in each month from October 2022 through February 2023. As resolution on the bankruptcy has not yet materialized, we deemed it appropriate to revisit [Indiscernible] as we've had on our Cineworld receivables balance as we continue to evaluate the collectability of these amounts.  As a result of this analysis and in an abundance of caution, in the fourth quarter, we recorded $13.7 million of additional reserves associated with nine Cineworld properties previously on accrual accounting. In total, we now have $35.6 million of cumulative reserves on 31 properties that are on cash basis accounting, representing approximately 70% of our outstanding receivables from Cineworld. As a result of these changes, our unreserved receivable outstanding from Cineworld was $15.6 million at year-end, excluding straight-line rent receivables and including both deferred contractual rent and deferred expense recoveries. The 31 properties on cash basis accounting currently account for approximately $2.6 million of monthly contractual base rent. Based on public information and our proprietary analysis, we continue to believe our portfolio of Cineworld assets generally comprised of the stronger performance in the operator's portfolio, and we will provide an update on the outcome of our negotiations when appropriate.  Finally, in January, we were pleased to welcome Greg White as Chief Operating Officer. The COO role has been vacant since 2018 when I assumed the role of CEO. And having known Greg for many years, I believe he has the experience, leadership qualities and business acumen to add immediate value to the management team.  Most recently, Greg served as a senior adviser in the Real Estate and Lodging Investment Banking group at UBS Securities. I admire Greg's extensive knowledge of the commercial estate space and his thoughtfulness and integrity will mesh well with our culture at Realty Income. I will now pass the call over to Christie, who will further discuss results from the quarter.\nChristie Kelly: Thank you, Sumit. Moving on to the balance sheet. As publicly disclosed, we've been quite active on the capital markets front. During the fourth quarter, we raised approximately $52 billion of equity proceeds primarily through our ATM program and when including equity sold in the first quarter of 2023, and we currently have approximately $850 million of unsettled forward equity available for future issuance. Throughout 2022, a we raised over $4.6 billion of gross equity proceeds at a weighted average price of $67.04, almost entirely through our ATM program. We ended the year with net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA in our targeted range at 5.5 time or 5.3 time giving effect to the annualization. Please note that these ratios do not reflect the outstanding equity forwards I referenced previously. Our capital market activities in the fourth quarter and in January were aimed at striking the right balance between terming out our short-term borrowings while providing us the flexibility to participate and a lower rate environment over the next three years. In addition to the 10-year $750 million senior unsecured bond issuance we priced in October at an effective yield of 3.93%. In January, we executed a dual tranche $1.1 billion senior unsecured bond offering. The offering consisted of $500 million three year notes callable after one year and $600 million of seven-year notes. In conjunction with the three-year note, we capitalized on an attractive window to swap our interest payments from a fixed to variable rate structure, which we expect will replace a portion of our existing variable rate exposure in the capital stack. After giving effect to the interest rate swap, we effectively locked in a variable rate spread of negative 3.5 basis points to SOFR, which represents estimated savings compared to our credit facility of over 85 basis points. It is important to note that the $500 million of variable rate exposure is expected to be in lieu of variable rate borrowings we would otherwise have outstanding on our revolver or on our commercial paper program. Lastly, in January, we closed on a new $1 billion multicurrency unsecured term loan with an initial tenor of one year and with two 12-month extension options. In conjunction with closing of the term loan, we entered into a variable to fixed-rate swap resulting in an all-in effective yield of 5%.  I would like to take a moment to say thank you to each of our lenders that participated. [technical difficulty] I would also like to make special mention of Jonathan Pong and Steve Backe for their tireless efforts and leadership in delivering upon our capital market strategies. Moving on to guidance for 2023. We are initiating AFFO per share guidance of $3.93 to $4.03, representing 1.5% growth at the midpoint of the earnings range and including our current dividend yield, a total operating return profile of circa 6%.  So, the annualization of higher interest rates has moderated our expected growth rate for 2023, there is much to be optimistic about. The investment pipeline remains active. We continue to source investment opportunities across our target markets at accretive cap rates in the mid-6 to mid-7 range. As a result, we are introducing 2023 investment guidance of greater than $5 billion, and we will, of course, revisit this guidance each quarter as we gain incremental visibility to our transaction pipeline. Finally, as the monthly dividend company, an increasing monthly dividend remains central to our business model. We were pleased to have announced a dividend increase of 2.4% last week which represents a 3.2% growth rate over the year ago period. We remain proud to be one of only three REITs in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index for having a dividend every year for over 25 consecutive years. With that, I would like to pass the call back to Sumit.\nSumit Roy: Thank you, Christie. In summary, our 2022 results demonstrated the capabilities of our platform and the competitive advantages afforded to us given our size, scale and access to capital. Over the long term, we believe stockholders will continue to benefit from the stability of our cash flows as we have proven with our track record of consistently positive total returns. Finally, we believe there is significant runway for further growth in untapped industries, geographies [technical difficulty] We look forward to unlocking these opportunities over time. At this time, we can open it up for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJoshua Dennerlein: I wanted to ask about the Plenty indoor farm deal. I guess this is a new industry for you guys as well as it seems like a relatively new industry in general. I guess how did you guys get comfortable with underwriting the risk and outlook for indoor farming?\nSumit Roy: So, thanks for the question, Josh. Indoor farming, as part of the revolution that we are seeing in ag tech is something that we've been looking at for the better part of a year now. And specifically working with Plenty to try to understand their technology and how they're going to play in the ecosystem in terms of delivering crops in a much, much more efficient manner than traditional farming. If you look at ag tech and you look at vertical farming within this space, this is estimated to be a $50 billion industry over the next few years. And Plenty has a very established position within this particular vertical. If you look at some of the sponsorship that they have, it's with companies like Walgreens, Albertsons, and Driscoll\u2019s. These are some of the largest grocers and providers of end product to grocery stores. And Walmart has also invested directly in this company, along with [technical difficulty] from which they're going to be served the end product. So, they have a lot of institutional sponsorship. We've gotten to know the company very well. And at the end of the day, it's a $42 million investment, very well-located industrial location happens to be very adjacent to an Amazon box.  And we felt very comfortable based on the risk-adjusted return profile across various different scenarios that this was going to be a solid real estate investment. Having said all of that, one of the phrase that was used internally, the cherry on the top was the fact that this aligns with our value system as well, the value of giving more than we take. We genuinely believe that ag tech and vertical farming, specifically is going to have a big role to play in a world that continues to be resource constrained, yield constrained, water constrained and continued deficiency of arable land going forward.  So, for all of those reasons, we got very comfortable with Plenty as an operator, and more importantly, this particular vertical within ag tech as an industry to pursue.\nJoshua Dennerlein: And then could you maybe elaborate a little bit on like the returns and the outlays, I know it's a $1 billion pipeline. Like is that something you expect to kind of put out the door all this year over the next 2, 3 -- and are you guys financing the equipment inside the warehouse? Just trying to get more color on the deal.\nSumit Roy: Sure. So, we are a real estate company, Josh, first and foremost. So that's all we are going to be investing in. Any equipment, all of the technology, et cetera, that is Plenty's responsibility. And so, none of the $42 million will go towards that. The $1 billion is a number that we hope to be able to invest with this name, which if we do would mean that this technology has become a success, and more importantly, this [technical difficulty] its position as one of the leaders in vertical farming. The investment itself has a much longer horizon, I would say, potentially the next five years. But keep in mind that any subsequent investment beyond the $42 million is on -- is at our option. And so obviously, we are going to approach this partnership from a purely real estate perspective. But a perspective that we do believe needs to partner with these types of technologies in order for these technologies to be successful. But ultimately, the real estate needs to work for us on a risk-adjusted return basis. And if that does, we are happy to help a company like Plenty continue to establish itself as a front runner in this space.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Anthony Paolone with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Paolone: Great. Thank you. Sumit, can you expand a bit on the consumer medical vertical that you talked about in terms of what are the types of service offerings that are most interesting to you right now? What do those boxes look like, types of operators, so forth, yields, maybe?\nSumit Roy: Yes. So, when we're talking about consumer-centric medical, we're talking about stuff that we are already currently exposed to and adding a few more areas around the edges. So, what are those areas? Like we are already exposed to drug stores, but drugstores of yesterday is not the drug store of tomorrow. What you've probably heard in the press both Walgreens and CVS are investing very heavily to continue to take share of the physician -- the general physician services. And this is an incredibly fragmented area of the business, and they are investing multibillion dollars in their health hub, minute clinics, et cetera, to [Indiscernible] be able to provide those services.  And so that will continue to be an area, infusion centers, dialysis, eye care, dental care, pediatric care, behavioral facilities, urgent care, those are all concepts that have gained tremendous momentum, especially post pandemic, and will continue to gain momentum as a method of delivering health care to the end consumer. And the belief here is that the per capita health care cost that we in this country experience is essentially 2 times the average of what an OECD company -- country experiences. And how do we continue to bring that down? And factors like convenience, being closer to the consumer, making sure that there is a relationship that can be established. So, issues can be addressed on the front end rather than when it becomes an issue later on in life. I mean, today, if you look at the U.S. health care, only 30% of the population actually has a general physician that they can identify as their own. 70% don't have one, and this goes back to preventative care as being a precursor to reducing the cost of health care. And that is the business model that we have embraced that we believe will be -- in addition to the traditional ways of delivering health care will be a very important step in helping reduce cost. And so, anything that sort of lends - any concept that lends itself to this will be open season for us. And what we have then looked at it is to try to analyze the actual boxes that these types of facilities are housed in. And what we found was that there is a 90% -- and I mentioned this in my prepared remarks, there's a 90% overlap with locations and boxes that we have in terms of size, in terms of [Indiscernible] et cetera. And there are a whole slew of variables that we looked at. And these assets that lend themselves to consumer-centric medical. And so, there are a lot of synergies. It is incredibly fragmented. It's a $1.8 trillion market today, expected to grow to $2 trillion by 2027. And it's all about increasing our total addressable market, using our core strength that we bring to the table to help consolidate the market and continue to sort of redefine what net lease investing is. And this is a perfect example  [Technical difficulty]  you had -- if you were saying something post the end of my answer, we missed all of that. So, you're back on.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. Sorry about that. And then my second question relates to yields and thinking about just near term, like the first and second quarter, I think you mentioned mid-6s to mid-7s. You did 6.1 in the fourth quarter, but just -- does it -- should we expect that it moves into that range here in the near term? Or is that a number that you might get to over the course of the year? Just trying to think through what you're seeing on the ground today?\nSumit Roy: Yes, Tony. We actually put out some numbers on January 9, we put out, I think, a pro sup when we were offering the unsecured bonds, where we shared the pipeline with you, and then the pipeline included transactions under contract and accepted LOIs. And that was circa $1.3 billion worth of transactions, a 7.1% cash cap rate. So clearly, what we are talking about in terms of finally the cap rates moving is now manifesting itself in the pipeline that we have created or we had created until that point.  And now more stepping back and more generally speaking, we have seen about 100 basis points plus/minus movement in cap rates, which we expected given that if you look at even 14 of the top 20 clients that we have, who have bonds that are trading, you look at what their spreads have done over the last, call it, eight months, nine months, those have gapped out about 100 basis points. So not that, that symmetry is perfectly congruous, but it seems to have been at least in terms of how cap rates have played out. So, you should be expecting to see those numbers being realized starting in the first quarter of 2023.\nAnthony Paolone: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nGreg McGinniss: Good afternoon. Sumit, regarding M&A, is that more or less likely in this environment with these opportunities you're finding in other verticals and portfolio discounts like we saw in CIM 71 cap? Or I mean, this paying a premium for public peer makes sense at this time?\nSumit Roy: Greg, that's a great question. Look, -- the -- if you look at the organic market and you've mentioned CIM and some of the other transactions that we've talked about already, there are very good transactions to be had at incredibly good risk-adjusted returns. Having said that, if there's an opportunity on the M&A front where you're able to realize similar economics, I don't see that as being mutually exclusive to be able to pursue both avenues of ultimately what we are charter to do, which is grow the business. But it does have that backdrop to compete against as an opportunity cost when we are looking at M&A. But I don't see there being less M&A because of the environment we find ourselves in. It's just the question of are we going to have partners who are willing to see the big picture, we're willing to see that being part of a particular pro forma company is better for the outlook than not. I think those are the elements that need to sort of play out on the sellers' behalf, in order to perpetuate M&A transactions. But look, we are very happy going down the path that we have -- that we are going down. We did $9 billion of acquisitions last year. I would say that, that's probably -- if you look at companies in our sector that takes care of 80%, 90% of what companies are in terms of their total size. So, we don't have to do M&A in order to continue to grow our business. self, and it makes sense for us to pursue that. We are not going to shy away from that either.\nGreg McGinniss: Okay. That's reasonable. And just for a second question here. Have the higher cap rates started to bring some of the private and private equity buyers off the sidelines? Or is competition for assets still limited?\nSumit Roy: They're certainly out there. The debt capital markets continues to be a constraint for them and their ability to react quickly in this market. I think certainty of close over the last six months has taken on a very different focus for potential buyers who, for a variety of reasons won't monetize their real estate.  And somebody like us, especially when it comes to bigger deals that can have that certainty of close that does not rely on the debt capital markets to finance their deals. I think has a distinct advantage which truth be told has played out in our favor over the last few months. And so yes, private equity will obviously start to sniff around given the higher cap rate environment. But I still don't think that their cost of capital is as competitive as ours and our ability to close still, I believe, stands out when potential sellers have to evaluate who to partner with.\nGreg McGinniss: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Spenser Allaway with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead. \nSpenser Allaway: Thank you. As it relates to cap rates, we've heard that the bid spread has compressed faster in the U.S. versus Europe. Is that consistent with what you've seen? And do you think that will dictate how you deploy capital in '23 as you look across both geographies?\nSumit Roy: Yes, that's a great question, Spenser. It doesn't have a perfect answer. If you look at the fourth quarter, we didn't do a lot of volume in Europe, circa $350 million, but they had a substantially higher cap rate. And the dynamic that played out there was essentially redemption issues that a lot of funds started to face towards the end of the year.  And that sort of precipitated monetizing their real estate portfolios to help meet those redemption issues, which obviously created an opportunity for somebody like us who, again, does not rely on the debt capital markets, is able to do transactions fairly quickly. And that's what resulted in that much higher cap rate. Because for the longest time in Europe, things were not moving. And that's the reason why the volume was only $387.9 [indiscernible], essentially happened towards the later part of the year, happened very quickly because of the specific dynamics. In the U.S., the trend has been slowly moving in this direction. And again, I think I mentioned this during our third quarter call, much faster than it had traditionally moved when you have a rising interest rate environment. And that's just because so much of the capital was pulled out of the market that it pushed specially sellers who are inclined to monetize their real estate, continuing going down that path has allowed for the cap rates to move.  Having said all of that, I do believe that where we find ourselves today is more of a bottoming out of that continued movement of expanding cap rates. And it's settling in the 6.5%, 7% for some of the products. Of course, there are still products that's trading in the high-5s. There's still some one-off assets that's trading in the low-5s, maybe even in the high-4s. We, in fact, sold one of our QSR assets with a 4% in front of it in terms of cap rates. So those markets, we will ignore because those are the tail areas of the cap rate environment. But by and large, we have seen this movement in cap rates play out and it's now starting to mentioned.\nSpenser Allaway: Okay. That was extremely helpful. Thank you. And there have been headlines regarding a EUR600 million to EUR700 million portfolio being marketed for which has been cited as a bidder. Is there anything you can share on the portfolio in terms of the general makeup or geography of those properties?\nSumit Roy: Yes. I wonder what your sources are, Spencer. We really don't want to talk about transactions that we don't have under contract. So -- we may or may not be involved in the transaction that you've mentioned. We can't speak to anything, which is a hypothesis or just a rumor in the industry. Sorry about that.\nOperator: Our next questioner is Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nHaendel St. Juste: Sumit, good afternoon. Just curious on an updated perspective on your high-grade philosophy here. I noticed again in the fourth quarter. The share was below your portfolio average even when you back out the Encore. In the past, I know you mentioned -- you have experience in acquiring higher-yielding assets and you're focused on the best risk-adjusted returns. But yet again, it's another quarter, your share of high-grade is far below the portfolio average. So maybe can you kind of give us some updated thinking on how we should think about that dynamic maybe going forward? Thanks.\nSumit Roy: I think you've sort of answered the question that you asked, Haendel. Ultimately, this is a game of finding the best risk-adjusted returns, just like you said, and the fact that something tends to be investment grade is an output of that underwriting. It's not something that we seek out. And the counter to what you're seeing in the fourth quarter is a CIM transaction, for instance. Here, we have an $894 million transaction with 48% of the rent coming from investment grade. And we were able to get a healthy cap rate. So that number is going to continue to move. In fact, if you were to just look at the $3.9 billion we did in the fourth quarter and like you did exclude the wind transaction, and one of -- a couple of the larger portfolio transactions that we did, that particular investment-grade number would be right up in the high 40s. So, that's going to fluctuate quarter-by-quarter. And what we need to get comfortable with is based on the risk that we are assuming and part of which is the credit risk are we being appropriately compensated. And if the answer comes back, yes, based on expected outcomes, then we are very comfortable continuing to pursue those transactions.\nHaendel St. Juste: That's helpful. I wanted to ask about Italy for a moment. Was the investing in the quarter basically the $350 million in Europe that you mentioned in of your earlier remarks? And then maybe can you talk a bit about the relative risk profile, how you're underwriting there versus perhaps the rest of the Europe or the United States? And what's the, I guess, investment appetite for Italy?\nSumit Roy: Look, Italy, as a country, definitely has more risk. But again, -- just like when we invested in the grocery business during the midst of Brexit, and we were very particular about the industry and more importantly, the operator within that industry that we were partnering with. If you look at Metro AG, it's an investment grade, very profitable, very well-established business, which is pan-European, I believe it's headquartered in Germany, and it controls 26% of the wholesale business in Italy. They have been established since the early 1970s in some of our locations. And so this is a business that we feel very comfortable with. Think of Metro as a combination of Costco and Cisco. Costco is very much retail-oriented and Cisco is much more professionally oriented. Both those businesses types of businesses is served out of Metro, and that's not going anywhere despite some of the additional country-specific risk that might exist in Italy. There are structural advantages as well that I'm not going to bore you with, which makes Italy a very interesting place to invest. But we are going to be very particular, just like we were in the U.K. and we were in Spain as to who we partner with, what are the concepts that we are going to be exposing ourselves to. And at the end of the day, what is the risk-adjusted return profile, look, taking into account some of these risks in some cases, additional risk that won't takes going into these new countries. But we feel very good about the investment that we've made with Metro in Italy.\nHaendel St. Juste: And just if I may, the follow-up is, did you -- is it $350 million in the quarter and ballpark, what are the going in cap rates or set of returns?\nSumit Roy: No, it wasn't all of $350 million. $350 million was the total investment that we made in Europe. I believe the Metro was \u20ac165 million or \u20ac165 million was the Metro investment. Most of the other investments were in the U.K.\nHaendel St. Juste: Cap rate?\nSumit Roy: You've got the blended cap rate, I believe, in the supplemental. It was 100 basis points north of what we did in the U.S., 7.1% cap rate. Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRonald Kamdem: Just can we just touch on tenant health really quickly. Obviously, occupancy is 99%. I see that the EBITDAR coverage is up slightly quarter-over-quarter. In the past, you sort of talked about sort of stress testing the tent and feeling pretty good. Just outside of the movie theaters, just where is your head at in terms of potential recession and tenant health.\nSumit Roy: That's a great question, Ron, especially entering into 2023 with so much uncertainty. Look, our biggest focus right now is on Cineworld and how that's going to -- what that resolution is going to look like. I do believe that whatever that outcome is, it's going to play out within the next few months. It's been in bankruptcy now for the better part of four months, and we have been in negotiations with them, and we'll leave it at that. Outside of that, if you look at our overall -- and again, this is something we share in the supplemental our cash flow coverages, full wall cash flow coverages, those have continued to trend up, largely a function of some of our existing clients continuing to outperform. Companies like Albertsons, et cetera, have continued to generate EBITDA growth on a four-wall basis, and therefore, those coverages have continued to improve. Some of the new transactions that we have entered into have very healthy four-wall coverage ratios. And this is, again, it very much ties in with the comment that I think it might have been handled was talking about why are we doing so many noninvestment-grade. If you look at it from a real estate perspective and you suddenly have coverages north of 4x, 5x in sound businesses, but they don't have an investment-grade rating given their size. Those are businesses that we will pursue. And so that's the reason why our four-wall coverage ratio is now close to 2.9x and it was in the 2.5 or about a year ago. So the health continues to be fairly good. If you look at what is there on our watch list, it's about 4% of our rent is on the tenant watch list. And as you can imagine, a lot of it is driven by the theater business. A lot of the theater assets are on our watch list. And in some cases, we also have assets that may not have a credit issue, but there is a location risk associated with what will happen at the end of the lease term, given the changing demographics, changing competitive landscape, et cetera, et cetera. So that constitutes our 4%, which is slightly higher than what it was a few quarters ago. And it's largely a function of what's happening in the theater space and what we expect will happen in a continued high interest rate environment.\nRonald Kamdem: Great. And then my second question, just touching on gaming. Obviously, the Encore deal closed. How is that going out as you have the assets and more importantly, what's the pipeline look like? How are you guys thinking about more -- doing more acquisitions in the gaming space.\nSumit Roy: Yes. So, we are very proud to own this beautiful asset in Boston. We just had a demonstration internally about our presence on LinkedIn and Twitter. And when we posted the news release around closing on this asset, we had a huge jump in following. So clearly, it was appreciated by the audience following Realty Income, and we are very proud to have this partnership with win. They are great operators. They are very good to sort of continue to understand and learn about this particular industry, and we hope to grow this industry. We didn't do this as a one-off opportunistic transaction. And -- it's very much in line with looking for the best operators and trying to get assets that are going to be icons for the given operator, but even outside of that. And I think we have checked all of those boxes on the Boston asset. But finding those types of assets will continue to be we are focused on. And as you can imagine, we have received several inbounds. But for a variety of reasons, we haven't chosen to pursue them because they don't need all of the attributes that we are looking for. So, we will be selective in this industry, but we would absolutely love to grow it over time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Wes Golladay with Baird. Please go ahead.\nWes Golladay: There's been a lot of M&A activity in the value-based care. So I was wondering if this is the industry you're referring to, where you see all the opportunity? And if so, would you get the parent's credit on some of these deals?\nSumit Roy: End up looking at Oak Street Health, for instance, that CVS ended up buying and they want to monetize some of those real estate then yes, by default, we are going to ask for CVS' credit on this $10 billion transaction that they just consummated. Walgreens has done a similar transaction. Amazon just announced that they did a similar transaction. Yes, it is precisely what we are talking about. We are calling it consumer-centric because we are approaching it from a pure state perspective and trying to find what are the alternatives of the locations that we have already -- and how does -- what are the synergies with this new vertical that we're pursuing. It's certainly not looking at what traditional health care companies are focused on. That's not our forte. That's not our strength. And that has really no interest to us today. But it is the value-based health care that a lot of forward thinking health care companies, operators, health care operators are pursuing. And the derivative of that will be the real estate. It could be our existing pharmacies that are going to be repositioned to health hubs and minute clinics. That's already happening. There's continued enhancement, there's continued higher impediments to switching costs that are getting created. Those are all perfect for us. That's embedded value that doesn't get realized day one, but we love to see that happen. And we also want to be intentional about growing the portfolio by doing the types of transactions that we did in the fourth quarter in this particular area because we do believe in it.\nWes Golladay: Got it. And then would you have, I guess, a lot of ground redevelopment opportunities? And then also, it sounds like you would have some redevelopment opportunities. Have you ever done redevelopment funding before? Or is that a big part of the business now?\nSumit Roy: We've certainly done redevelopment funding, Wes. If you look at our pipeline dollars today and some of that is repositioning of our existing assets. And we've done some in-house. We've done a lot of it with partners, national partners that we have. And those have been some of the best recapture rates that we have achieved in our portfolio. So when we talk about this 90% overlap in terms of real estate characteristics, of the locations that we currently own and some of these consumer-centric medical concepts, that certainly lends itself to repositioning some of our assets for highest and best use. And we define highest and best use in terms of rent per square foot that we could recapture for a given location that we already own. And so yes, I'd hope to be able to partner with these operators, show some of our existing vacancies, potential vacancies that are going to come down the pike. And reposition these locations to help provide these types of services. So yes, that is out of a value-enhancing proposition that we're going to explore.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please go ahead.\nMichael Goldsmith: Can you talk about your view on interest rates in the capital markets based on your recent capital raising activities? It seems that Jonathan and Steve were busy with several less traditional items with the term loan with multiple extensions and the callable unsecured? Just trying to get a sense of what you're trying to achieve based on the laddering with these instruments.\nJonathan Pong: Michael, it's Jonathan. I would say, the activities that we did in January, early January, it's all about financial flexibility. We, if you noticed, did a three-year non-call one, giving us that flexibility after one year to call at par. We also did a one-year term loan, but what two one-year extension option. And so, what we're trying to avoid, especially since we went long on the curve earlier in 2022 with our debt capital raising efforts, what was the lock in rates that these levels are very attractive to us. We would like to think that over the next three years, there will be a more advantageous window for us to tap into the debt capital markets to term these amounts out. And so, it's really about maybe a little bit of a barbell given the activity we did earlier in the year, much lower long-term rates, but also terming out the revolver to an extent and creating that flexibility for us to participate and lower rates if they come.\nMichael Goldsmith: And my second question, we've talked about each of the new verticals in depth, but just wanted to talk about the big picture associated with this. Does this -- is this a function of something has fundamentally changed with kind of the traditional core retail assets or industrial assets that you are known for. And I guess, does this -- these new opportunities provide more confidence in your ability to consistently hit or exceed the $5 billion of acquisitions that you've guided to the last couple of years?\nSumit Roy: That's a very good question, Michael. It's a question that we've asked ourselves. There is a traditional definition of what a net lease company does. And yes, we can certainly be mandated and dictated by that or there was a way for us to step back and say, look, if we look at Realty Income, what is our core strength today, our size and scale, which people have continued to point to as impediments to growth. If you look at the last four years, we've grown our business at 5% CAGR annually. And if you look at the business, this question has been asked for the last 10 years was, we are going to take what has been used by The Street as an impediment and see if we can garner value for us shareholders, and let's just ask the question, what is it that we can do with the core strength of size, scale, cost of capital, that will be difficult for other companies to follow. And if the answer was, sorry, you're constrained by your business model and this is all you should do, and this is all you can do, that would have been the answer. But what we found once we started last the question around redefining this particular space is that there's plenty for us to do. And we are only constrained by our ability to be creative. And ultimately, if we continue to underwrite these verticals and look at it from the perspective of real estate and look at it from the perspective of a net lease suddenly, the answers that start to pop up are very different. And it allows you to do things and allows you to be very creative and create outsized riches for our shareholders. That with due respect, a lot of our peers are going to struggle trying to mimic. They just don't have the scale. And so, if we can help consolidate real estate, through a net lease structure, that is really the only governing principle that should be constraining us. And ultimately be able to show to the shareholders that on a risk-adjusted return, these are as safe, if not in some cases, safer than investing in traditional retail net lease businesses, then it's a win-win. So that's how we are thinking about the business, Michael. And you will continue to see us be very creative. But like I've always done, and like this team here has always done, we will engage with you to share our thesis. And by the way, I do highly encourage everyone to go to the new deck, the investor deck, where we've laid out our thesis in more detail, and you'll see some numbers around -- and you'll find that this is what I think people invest in Realty Income for, and we are just delivering on that promise.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Massocca with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead.\nJohn Massocca: So, we're reaching about the hour mark here, so I'll take us back to the beginning a little bit. As we think about the delta in the Plenty transaction between the $42 million committed for the Virginia projects, and the $1 billion headline opportunity? Do you have some kind of like right of first refusal or purchase option to kind of get to that higher number? Just trying to kind of figure out what's in the remaining amount beyond the $42 million for the actual project that's underway?\nSumit Roy: So John, the best way to answer that is any real estate development outside of a carve-out for one particular client that I mentioned already, which is a user of their end product, we basically get to take a look at the opportunity. And then if we wish not to pursue it, we don't have to. But we, as their real estate partner will be given an opportunity to look at any real estate development that they enter into over the next five or six years. There's a time frame associated with that. But ultimately, the goal here is to continue to invest because that would mean that they are becoming a more and more successful operator within vertical farming, and we are their real estate partner going forward. But yes, so it is a concept of the optionality lies with us in terms of how much more we invest.\nJohn Massocca: Okay. Understood. And then can you provide a little more color on the dental portfolio acquired in 4Q? What made that specific portfolio attractive? And can you provide some color on the credit behind of those assets?\nSumit Roy: So it's not rated. It was a situation where you had the operator own both the operations as well as the real estate. And this was a mechanism for them to monetize their real estate and continue to invest in the operations of the business. I think we are very constrained by what it is that we can share. This was a highly negotiated transaction but it is one that we are very excited about. And this is, again, an advent into this consumer-centric medical real estate in a big way, and we felt like it was large enough for us to sort of engage in and talk about, but we can't be more specific than that. You know what our overall cap rate was for the quarter, and this was a very small component of it, given that it was a $4 million quarter. But that's the extent of what we can do about it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nLinda Tsai: What are some of the benefits you hope to achieve by filling in the vacant role of the COO?\nSumit Roy: Greg is sitting right here, and he's already -- he's been with us about 1.5 months, and he's already added so much value to all of our discussions. It's very bright mind and now he's going to start blushing, but he's somebody that I've respected. I've known Greg for the last -- I guess now it's almost 15 years. And he has a perspective that he brings to the table that is very unique and is going to be incredibly additive to all of us. Look, our business is becoming more and more complicated. We are becoming a bigger and bigger organization. We need talented people to continue to that. But the most important thing about Greg, in my mind is his integrity and his ability to -- and his leadership qualities and his ability to mentor -- those are all qualities that will be put to good use, especially with the next batch of leaders that we are cultivating internally and he will be a massive help in accelerating them to very senior leadership positions within the Company, which, by the way, this company will need in order to continue to execute its strategy and plan.\nLinda Tsai: And then just in terms of recurring CapEx being less than 1% of Realty Income's NOI, does this vary whether the properties are domestic or international? And are your new verticals consistent with this threshold to?\nSumit Roy: It depends on the type of leases that we have. I will tell you that, for example, an industrial lease tends to have structural and roof responsibilities, that's on the landlord. And so obviously, CapEx there, not maintenance CapEx necessarily, but just CapEx in general -- is going to be higher. Now some of it will be viewed as maintenance. Some of it will be viewed as improving the life of the real estate. So the categorization of that CapEx may be different, but it is very much a function of the lease. I would say that in the U.K., there is even on the retail side, there is not perfectly what we call quad net assets. So we do have a lot more leakage. But lot more leakage is a relative term to very little leakage here in the U.S. And so all said and done, it's not a big part of our business. It's something that we share. It's part of the AFFO. And again, all of that is underwritten when we are thinking about the long-term return profile of investments that we make, obviously take into consideration on the front end before moving forward on transactions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tayo Okusanya with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nTayo Okusanya: Just a quick follow-up on Haendel's question. So again, doing a little bit more in the non-IG space, your watch list is a little bit bigger. On the flip side, your rent coverages are getting stronger and stronger. How do we think about just kind of credit provisioning on a going-forward basis with all these kind of in factors and what you kind of look at as kind of adequate provisioning relative to historical levels, does kind of given the business backdrop.\nSumit Roy: Yes. Tayo, it's not a perfect science. You've put forth two data points that we've shared with you that are polar opposites. How in this backdrop of uncertainty we have four-wall coverages that continue to improve, yet we are doing less and less of investment grade, but that goes back to the underwriting. And I already mentioned to you that there are a couple of retail names that are not investment-grade but to have coverages north of 5x. And again, it's a question of are these businesses that we are comfortable with. With the backdrop of this high interest rate environment, we are not going to be doing transactions where you're going to have an operator that doesn't have a business model that can sustain what we are going to experience, especially in the near term because that would not be good.\n--: But last year was a phenomenal year for us. We had a similar provisioning that we kept adjusting throughout the year and ended up actually having bad debt expense below what we have traditionally experienced in the business. So again, we expect the worst we underwrite to what we expect and allow for the better outcomes to play out. And that's really how we think about our business, Tayo.\nTayo Okusanya: Okay. Could you share any specific numbers about the provisioning of like 60 basis points or 75 basis points is the bogie?\nSumit Roy: You mean in terms of what we have in the earnings guidance?\nTayo Okusanya: In the guidance, yes, in the guidance.\nSumit Roy:\n--:\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJosh Dennerlein: Just one more, just on the tenant front, I don't think we touched the watch list, saw some news on kind of -- or the Red Lobster has been in the news, I guess, they closed a few stores. Any kind of updates on the watch list and maybe just Red Lobster in general?\nSumit Roy: You missed it. Somebody else asked us about the watch list. It's right around 4%. You brought up Red Lobster, there were rumors around that Red Lobster was trying to negotiate rents with landlords, I can unequivocally tell you that, that is not the case, at least they haven't reached approached us. There certainly was assets that they have closed again, none of which impacted our portfolio. And there are some challenges with that operation. It represents about 1% of our rent. But again, I do think that some of the missteps that they had made in the third, fourth quarter of last year have essentially been reversed. They were slow to make pricing adjustments. They have rectified that. And they are managing their inventory much better and all of those should result in better performance. But I just wanted to make sure that we were talking about facts and not rumors that have percolated in the rumor mill.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference over to Sumit Roy for any closing remarks.\nSumit Roy: Well, thank you, Dave, for hosting us, and thank you, everyone, for joining in. I look forward to seeing you guys in the upcoming conferences. Take care.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Christie Kelly",
            "content": "Thank you, Sumit. Moving on to the balance sheet. As publicly disclosed, we've been quite active on the capital markets front. During the fourth quarter, we raised approximately $52 billion of equity proceeds primarily through our ATM program and when including equity sold in the first quarter of 2023, and we currently have approximately $850 million of unsettled forward equity available for future issuance. Throughout 2022, a we raised over $4.6 billion of gross equity proceeds at a weighted average price of $67.04, almost entirely through our ATM program. We ended the year with net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDA in our targeted range at 5.5 time or 5.3 time giving effect to the annualization. Please note that these ratios do not reflect the outstanding equity forwards I referenced previously. Our capital market activities in the fourth quarter and in January were aimed at striking the right balance between terming out our short-term borrowings while providing us the flexibility to participate and a lower rate environment over the next three years. In addition to the 10-year $750 million senior unsecured bond issuance we priced in October at an effective yield of 3.93%. In January, we executed a dual tranche $1.1 billion senior unsecured bond offering. The offering consisted of $500 million three year notes callable after one year and $600 million of seven-year notes. In conjunction with the three-year note, we capitalized on an attractive window to swap our interest payments from a fixed to variable rate structure, which we expect will replace a portion of our existing variable rate exposure in the capital stack. After giving effect to the interest rate swap, we effectively locked in a variable rate spread of negative 3.5 basis points to SOFR, which represents estimated savings compared to our credit facility of over 85 basis points. It is important to note that the $500 million of variable rate exposure is expected to be in lieu of variable rate borrowings we would otherwise have outstanding on our revolver or on our commercial paper program. Lastly, in January, we closed on a new $1 billion multicurrency unsecured term loan with an initial tenor of one year and with two 12-month extension options. In conjunction with closing of the term loan, we entered into a variable to fixed-rate swap resulting in an all-in effective yield of 5%.  I would like to take a moment to say thank you to each of our lenders that participated. [technical difficulty] I would also like to make special mention of Jonathan Pong and Steve Backe for their tireless efforts and leadership in delivering upon our capital market strategies. Moving on to guidance for 2023. We are initiating AFFO per share guidance of $3.93 to $4.03, representing 1.5% growth at the midpoint of the earnings range and including our current dividend yield, a total operating return profile of circa 6%.  So, the annualization of higher interest rates has moderated our expected growth rate for 2023, there is much to be optimistic about. The investment pipeline remains active. We continue to source investment opportunities across our target markets at accretive cap rates in the mid-6 to mid-7 range. As a result, we are introducing 2023 investment guidance of greater than $5 billion, and we will, of course, revisit this guidance each quarter as we gain incremental visibility to our transaction pipeline. Finally, as the monthly dividend company, an increasing monthly dividend remains central to our business model. We were pleased to have announced a dividend increase of 2.4% last week which represents a 3.2% growth rate over the year ago period. We remain proud to be one of only three REITs in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index for having a dividend every year for over 25 consecutive years. With that, I would like to pass the call back to Sumit."

            "content": "Thank you, Julie. Welcome, everyone. 2022 was a year of significant growth for our company. I would like to express my gratitude and appreciation to the Realty Income team, who have worked tirelessly to execute on our strategic objectives and all of our investors for their support. The result of our team's collective efforts was reflected in our 2022 results, highlighted by AFFO per share growth of 9.2%, the highest annual growth rate for our company since 2013. Additionally, we closed on approximately $9 billion of high-quality investments in 2022, including $3.9 billion in the fourth quarter, both the annual and fourth quarter investment volume set record highs for the company. Underpinning investment activity, transaction flow remains robust. We sourced $17 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing 2022 sourcing volume to $95 billion. Finally, we ended the year with occupancy of 99%, our highest occupancy rate at the end of a reporting period in over 20 years. At Realty Income, we strive to provide stability and sustainable growth on behalf of our investors. And during periods of economic uncertainty like we find ourselves in today, the resilience demonstrated by our business model is important to highlight. During our 28-year history as a public company, our combined total return consisting of AFFO per share growth and dividend payments generated by our operations has not experienced a single year of downside volatility in the form of negative total returns. We believe we are in a very limited company among companies in the S&P 500 who can make that claim. This is a testament to the durability of our underlying cash flows, which is supported by a diversified portfolio of properties under long-term leases with clients that are leaders in their respective industries. We are constantly working to incubate new swim lanes for growth that offer attractive risk-adjusted returns. Since the start of 2022, we have expanded our [technical difficulty] new verticals to our platform. In October, we completed our debut transaction in Italy, acquiring seven wholesale clubs operated by Metro AG, an investment-grade pan-European leader in the wholesale club industry. As we discussed in 2019, when we purchased our first property internationally, we are intentional about consolidating the fragmented commercial real estate market in Europe and Italy represents the third country abroad in which we now have a presence. In December, we closed our $1.7 billion acquisition of Encore Boston Harbor resort and Casino from Wynn Resorts, which represent our first transaction in the gaming industry. The property is a good example of our strategy to partner with best-in-class operators to acquire high-quality real estate. It was purchased at a discount to estimated replacement cost, is subject to a long triple net lease of 30 years with attractive annual rent escalators and is located on prime real estate with structural barriers to competition. As anticipated in August 2022, Massachusetts partially legalized professional and collegiate sports wagering for the state, unlocking an estimated $850 million of gross annual gaming revenue and further supporting the strategic importance of this asset. In addition, we are pleased to announce a significant investment in what we are calling the consumer [technical difficulty] through the acquisition of a 224-property portfolio of dental practices during the fourth quarter. We expect this $520 million transaction to be just the start of additional investments we hope to make in a sector that we estimate has a total addressable market in the U.S. of nearly $1.8 trillion in real estate. We believe the consumer-centric medical industry shares many of the same attributes of the nondiscretionary service-based uses that make up much of our portfolio, and that have proven resilient throughout our company's long history. These locations offer essential goods and services in and around the major thoroughfares in which our assets are [technical difficulty] for properties leased to clients in the consumer-centric medical industry is extremely fragmented, which creates consolidation opportunities, we believe we are well suited to address. We believe this industry will continue to move towards a patient-centric model. The trend towards the outpatient model has been ongoing for decades, but we expect this shift to occur in an accelerated fashion post pandemic and will manifest in several ways that support our investment in the industry.  First, the convenience of having care delivered closer to the patient will increase accessibility to the patient and reduce costs for all, including patients, payers and providers. Second, existing clients of ours like Walgreens and CVS will continue to disrupt the status quo as they gain an increasing share of primary care over time. And third, we believe these industry dynamics will help lower the per capita spend on health care in the U.S. and help improve the quality of outcomes. It is also important to note that the adjacency and fungibility of these assets are a strong fit with our existing footprint from a real estate standpoint. As we underwrote this industry, we conducted a study analyzing over 30,000 variables and found that our portfolio had a 90% similarity with a data set of assets in this industry and we look forward to increasing our exposure over time.  Moving on, as we announced earlier this week, actually yesterday, we have entered into a strategic alliance with Plenty, an emerging leader in vertical farms operations to support the development of Plenty's indoor vertical farms. As the initial transaction of the alliance, we will fund the development of an indoor vertical farm asset near Richmond, Virginia, located adjacent to an Amazon distribution facility. Plenty's highly automated farming architecture efficiently harnesses scarce natural resources to generate production yields that it believes are up to 350 times greater per acre than conventional farming. We regard Plenty as the forefront of a structural evolution in crop production and [technical difficulty] growth plans. In summary, these distinct new verticals are representative of the growth opportunities we expect to unlock over time to create value for our shareholders.  Moving on to our portfolio. In addition to our record occupancy at year-end, we are proud to have delivered a rent recapture rate of 103.8% during the fourth quarter on properties renewed or re-leased, bringing our full year recapture rate to 105.9%. We attribute these results to our proactive asset management efforts, the underlying quality of our real estate and our rent levels in the portfolio relative to market. Despite our recent accomplishments, we are still working through the impact of the pending bankruptcy on our Cineworld exposure, which is 1.4% of our total portfolio annualized base rent. As a reminder, -- we own 41 assets, 17 of which are subject to a single master lease agreement and 22 of which have been accounted for under cash basis accounting since the third quarter of 2020. Following the announcement of the Cineworld bankruptcy in September 2022, we have collected 100% of contractual rent in each month from October 2022 through February 2023. As resolution on the bankruptcy has not yet materialized, we deemed it appropriate to revisit [Indiscernible] as we've had on our Cineworld receivables balance as we continue to evaluate the collectability of these amounts.  As a result of this analysis and in an abundance of caution, in the fourth quarter, we recorded $13.7 million of additional reserves associated with nine Cineworld properties previously on accrual accounting. In total, we now have $35.6 million of cumulative reserves on 31 properties that are on cash basis accounting, representing approximately 70% of our outstanding receivables from Cineworld. As a result of these changes, our unreserved receivable outstanding from Cineworld was $15.6 million at year-end, excluding straight-line rent receivables and including both deferred contractual rent and deferred expense recoveries. The 31 properties on cash basis accounting currently account for approximately $2.6 million of monthly contractual base rent. Based on public information and our proprietary analysis, we continue to believe our portfolio of Cineworld assets generally comprised of the stronger performance in the operator's portfolio, and we will provide an update on the outcome of our negotiations when appropriate.  Finally, in January, we were pleased to welcome Greg White as Chief Operating Officer. The COO role has been vacant since 2018 when I assumed the role of CEO. And having known Greg for many years, I believe he has the experience, leadership qualities and business acumen to add immediate value to the management team.  Most recently, Greg served as a senior adviser in the Real Estate and Lodging Investment Banking group at UBS Securities. I admire Greg's extensive knowledge of the commercial estate space and his thoughtfulness and integrity will mesh well with our culture at Realty Income. I will now pass the call over to Christie, who will further discuss results from the quarter. Thank you, Christie. In summary, our 2022 results demonstrated the capabilities of our platform and the competitive advantages afforded to us given our size, scale and access to capital. Over the long term, we believe stockholders will continue to benefit from the stability of our cash flows as we have proven with our track record of consistently positive total returns. Finally, we believe there is significant runway for further growth in untapped industries, geographies [technical difficulty] We look forward to unlocking these opportunities over time. At this time, we can open it up for questions. Operator? So, thanks for the question, Josh. Indoor farming, as part of the revolution that we are seeing in ag tech is something that we've been looking at for the better part of a year now. And specifically working with Plenty to try to understand their technology and how they're going to play in the ecosystem in terms of delivering crops in a much, much more efficient manner than traditional farming. If you look at ag tech and you look at vertical farming within this space, this is estimated to be a $50 billion industry over the next few years. And Plenty has a very established position within this particular vertical. If you look at some of the sponsorship that they have, it's with companies like Walgreens, Albertsons, and Driscoll's. These are some of the largest grocers and providers of end product to grocery stores. And Walmart has also invested directly in this company, along with [technical difficulty] from which they're going to be served the end product. So, they have a lot of institutional sponsorship. We've gotten to know the company very well. And at the end of the day, it's a $42 million investment, very well-located industrial location happens to be very adjacent to an Amazon box.  And we felt very comfortable based on the risk-adjusted return profile across various different scenarios that this was going to be a solid real estate investment. Having said all of that, one of the phrase that was used internally, the cherry on the top was the fact that this aligns with our value system as well, the value of giving more than we take. We genuinely believe that ag tech and vertical farming, specifically is going to have a big role to play in a world that continues to be resource constrained, yield constrained, water constrained and continued deficiency of arable land going forward.  So, for all of those reasons, we got very comfortable with Plenty as an operator, and more importantly, this particular vertical within ag tech as an industry to pursue. Sure. So, we are a real estate company, Josh, first and foremost. So that's all we are going to be investing in. Any equipment, all of the technology, et cetera, that is Plenty's responsibility. And so, none of the $42 million will go towards that. The $1 billion is a number that we hope to be able to invest with this name, which if we do would mean that this technology has become a success, and more importantly, this [technical difficulty] its position as one of the leaders in vertical farming. The investment itself has a much longer horizon, I would say, potentially the next five years. But keep in mind that any subsequent investment beyond the $42 million is on -- is at our option. And so obviously, we are going to approach this partnership from a purely real estate perspective. But a perspective that we do believe needs to partner with these types of technologies in order for these technologies to be successful. But ultimately, the real estate needs to work for us on a risk-adjusted return basis. And if that does, we are happy to help a company like Plenty continue to establish itself as a front runner in this space. Yes. So, when we're talking about consumer-centric medical, we're talking about stuff that we are already currently exposed to and adding a few more areas around the edges. So, what are those areas? Like we are already exposed to drug stores, but drugstores of yesterday is not the drug store of tomorrow. What you've probably heard in the press both Walgreens and CVS are investing very heavily to continue to take share of the physician -- the general physician services. And this is an incredibly fragmented area of the business, and they are investing multibillion dollars in their health hub, minute clinics, et cetera, to [Indiscernible] be able to provide those services.  And so that will continue to be an area, infusion centers, dialysis, eye care, dental care, pediatric care, behavioral facilities, urgent care, those are all concepts that have gained tremendous momentum, especially post pandemic, and will continue to gain momentum as a method of delivering health care to the end consumer. And the belief here is that the per capita health care cost that we in this country experience is essentially 2 times the average of what an OECD company -- country experiences. And how do we continue to bring that down? And factors like convenience, being closer to the consumer, making sure that there is a relationship that can be established. So, issues can be addressed on the front end rather than when it becomes an issue later on in life. I mean, today, if you look at the U.S. health care, only 30% of the population actually has a general physician that they can identify as their own. 70% don't have one, and this goes back to preventative care as being a precursor to reducing the cost of health care. And that is the business model that we have embraced that we believe will be -- in addition to the traditional ways of delivering health care will be a very important step in helping reduce cost. And so, anything that sort of lends - any concept that lends itself to this will be open season for us. And what we have then looked at it is to try to analyze the actual boxes that these types of facilities are housed in. And what we found was that there is a 90% -- and I mentioned this in my prepared remarks, there's a 90% overlap with locations and boxes that we have in terms of size, in terms of [Indiscernible] et cetera. And there are a whole slew of variables that we looked at. And these assets that lend themselves to consumer-centric medical. And so, there are a lot of synergies. It is incredibly fragmented. It's a $1.8 trillion market today, expected to grow to $2 trillion by 2027. And it's all about increasing our total addressable market, using our core strength that we bring to the table to help consolidate the market and continue to sort of redefine what net lease investing is. And this is a perfect example  [Technical difficulty]  you had -- if you were saying something post the end of my answer, we missed all of that. So, you're back on. Yes, Tony. We actually put out some numbers on January 9, we put out, I think, a pro sup when we were offering the unsecured bonds, where we shared the pipeline with you, and then the pipeline included transactions under contract and accepted LOIs. And that was circa $1.3 billion worth of transactions, a 7.1% cash cap rate. So clearly, what we are talking about in terms of finally the cap rates moving is now manifesting itself in the pipeline that we have created or we had created until that point.  And now more stepping back and more generally speaking, we have seen about 100 basis points plus/minus movement in cap rates, which we expected given that if you look at even 14 of the top 20 clients that we have, who have bonds that are trading, you look at what their spreads have done over the last, call it, eight months, nine months, those have gapped out about 100 basis points. So not that, that symmetry is perfectly congruous, but it seems to have been at least in terms of how cap rates have played out. So, you should be expecting to see those numbers being realized starting in the first quarter of 2023. Greg, that's a great question. Look, -- the -- if you look at the organic market and you've mentioned CIM and some of the other transactions that we've talked about already, there are very good transactions to be had at incredibly good risk-adjusted returns. Having said that, if there's an opportunity on the M&A front where you're able to realize similar economics, I don't see that as being mutually exclusive to be able to pursue both avenues of ultimately what we are charter to do, which is grow the business. But it does have that backdrop to compete against as an opportunity cost when we are looking at M&A. But I don't see there being less M&A because of the environment we find ourselves in. It's just the question of are we going to have partners who are willing to see the big picture, we're willing to see that being part of a particular pro forma company is better for the outlook than not. I think those are the elements that need to sort of play out on the sellers' behalf, in order to perpetuate M&A transactions. But look, we are very happy going down the path that we have -- that we are going down. We did $9 billion of acquisitions last year. I would say that, that's probably -- if you look at companies in our sector that takes care of 80%, 90% of what companies are in terms of their total size. So, we don't have to do M&A in order to continue to grow our business. self, and it makes sense for us to pursue that. We are not going to shy away from that either. They're certainly out there. The debt capital markets continues to be a constraint for them and their ability to react quickly in this market. I think certainty of close over the last six months has taken on a very different focus for potential buyers who, for a variety of reasons won't monetize their real estate.  And somebody like us, especially when it comes to bigger deals that can have that certainty of close that does not rely on the debt capital markets to finance their deals. I think has a distinct advantage which truth be told has played out in our favor over the last few months. And so yes, private equity will obviously start to sniff around given the higher cap rate environment. But I still don't think that their cost of capital is as competitive as ours and our ability to close still, I believe, stands out when potential sellers have to evaluate who to partner with. Yes, that's a great question, Spenser. It doesn't have a perfect answer. If you look at the fourth quarter, we didn't do a lot of volume in Europe, circa $350 million, but they had a substantially higher cap rate. And the dynamic that played out there was essentially redemption issues that a lot of funds started to face towards the end of the year.  And that sort of precipitated monetizing their real estate portfolios to help meet those redemption issues, which obviously created an opportunity for somebody like us who, again, does not rely on the debt capital markets, is able to do transactions fairly quickly. And that's what resulted in that much higher cap rate. Because for the longest time in Europe, things were not moving. And that's the reason why the volume was only $387.9 [indiscernible], essentially happened towards the later part of the year, happened very quickly because of the specific dynamics. In the U.S., the trend has been slowly moving in this direction. And again, I think I mentioned this during our third quarter call, much faster than it had traditionally moved when you have a rising interest rate environment. And that's just because so much of the capital was pulled out of the market that it pushed specially sellers who are inclined to monetize their real estate, continuing going down that path has allowed for the cap rates to move.  Having said all of that, I do believe that where we find ourselves today is more of a bottoming out of that continued movement of expanding cap rates. And it's settling in the 6.5%, 7% for some of the products. Of course, there are still products that's trading in the high-5s. There's still some one-off assets that's trading in the low-5s, maybe even in the high-4s. We, in fact, sold one of our QSR assets with a 4% in front of it in terms of cap rates. So those markets, we will ignore because those are the tail areas of the cap rate environment. But by and large, we have seen this movement in cap rates play out and it's now starting to mentioned. Yes. I wonder what your sources are, Spencer. We really don't want to talk about transactions that we don't have under contract. So -- we may or may not be involved in the transaction that you've mentioned. We can't speak to anything, which is a hypothesis or just a rumor in the industry. Sorry about that. I think you've sort of answered the question that you asked, Haendel. Ultimately, this is a game of finding the best risk-adjusted returns, just like you said, and the fact that something tends to be investment grade is an output of that underwriting. It's not something that we seek out. And the counter to what you're seeing in the fourth quarter is a CIM transaction, for instance. Here, we have an $894 million transaction with 48% of the rent coming from investment grade. And we were able to get a healthy cap rate. So that number is going to continue to move. In fact, if you were to just look at the $3.9 billion we did in the fourth quarter and like you did exclude the wind transaction, and one of -- a couple of the larger portfolio transactions that we did, that particular investment-grade number would be right up in the high 40s. So, that's going to fluctuate quarter-by-quarter. And what we need to get comfortable with is based on the risk that we are assuming and part of which is the credit risk are we being appropriately compensated. And if the answer comes back, yes, based on expected outcomes, then we are very comfortable continuing to pursue those transactions. Look, Italy, as a country, definitely has more risk. But again, -- just like when we invested in the grocery business during the midst of Brexit, and we were very particular about the industry and more importantly, the operator within that industry that we were partnering with. If you look at Metro AG, it's an investment grade, very profitable, very well-established business, which is pan-European, I believe it's headquartered in Germany, and it controls 26% of the wholesale business in Italy. They have been established since the early 1970s in some of our locations. And so this is a business that we feel very comfortable with. Think of Metro as a combination of Costco and Cisco. Costco is very much retail-oriented and Cisco is much more professionally oriented. Both those businesses types of businesses is served out of Metro, and that's not going anywhere despite some of the additional country-specific risk that might exist in Italy. There are structural advantages as well that I'm not going to bore you with, which makes Italy a very interesting place to invest. But we are going to be very particular, just like we were in the U.K. and we were in Spain as to who we partner with, what are the concepts that we are going to be exposing ourselves to. And at the end of the day, what is the risk-adjusted return profile, look, taking into account some of these risks in some cases, additional risk that won't takes going into these new countries. But we feel very good about the investment that we've made with Metro in Italy. No, it wasn't all of $350 million. $350 million was the total investment that we made in Europe. I believe the Metro was \u20ac165 million or \u20ac165 million was the Metro investment. Most of the other investments were in the U.K. You've got the blended cap rate, I believe, in the supplemental. It was 100 basis points north of what we did in the U.S., 7.1% cap rate. Sure. That's a great question, Ron, especially entering into 2023 with so much uncertainty. Look, our biggest focus right now is on Cineworld and how that's going to -- what that resolution is going to look like. I do believe that whatever that outcome is, it's going to play out within the next few months. It's been in bankruptcy now for the better part of four months, and we have been in negotiations with them, and we'll leave it at that. Outside of that, if you look at our overall -- and again, this is something we share in the supplemental our cash flow coverages, full wall cash flow coverages, those have continued to trend up, largely a function of some of our existing clients continuing to outperform. Companies like Albertsons, et cetera, have continued to generate EBITDA growth on a four-wall basis, and therefore, those coverages have continued to improve. Some of the new transactions that we have entered into have very healthy four-wall coverage ratios. And this is, again, it very much ties in with the comment that I think it might have been handled was talking about why are we doing so many noninvestment-grade. If you look at it from a real estate perspective and you suddenly have coverages north of 4x, 5x in sound businesses, but they don't have an investment-grade rating given their size. Those are businesses that we will pursue. And so that's the reason why our four-wall coverage ratio is now close to 2.9x and it was in the 2.5 or about a year ago. So the health continues to be fairly good. If you look at what is there on our watch list, it's about 4% of our rent is on the tenant watch list. And as you can imagine, a lot of it is driven by the theater business. A lot of the theater assets are on our watch list. And in some cases, we also have assets that may not have a credit issue, but there is a location risk associated with what will happen at the end of the lease term, given the changing demographics, changing competitive landscape, et cetera, et cetera. So that constitutes our 4%, which is slightly higher than what it was a few quarters ago. And it's largely a function of what's happening in the theater space and what we expect will happen in a continued high interest rate environment. Yes. So, we are very proud to own this beautiful asset in Boston. We just had a demonstration internally about our presence on LinkedIn and Twitter. And when we posted the news release around closing on this asset, we had a huge jump in following. So clearly, it was appreciated by the audience following Realty Income, and we are very proud to have this partnership with win. They are great operators. They are very good to sort of continue to understand and learn about this particular industry, and we hope to grow this industry. We didn't do this as a one-off opportunistic transaction. And -- it's very much in line with looking for the best operators and trying to get assets that are going to be icons for the given operator, but even outside of that. And I think we have checked all of those boxes on the Boston asset. But finding those types of assets will continue to be we are focused on. And as you can imagine, we have received several inbounds. But for a variety of reasons, we haven't chosen to pursue them because they don't need all of the attributes that we are looking for. So, we will be selective in this industry, but we would absolutely love to grow it over time. End up looking at Oak Street Health, for instance, that CVS ended up buying and they want to monetize some of those real estate then yes, by default, we are going to ask for CVS' credit on this $10 billion transaction that they just consummated. Walgreens has done a similar transaction. Amazon just announced that they did a similar transaction. Yes, it is precisely what we are talking about. We are calling it consumer-centric because we are approaching it from a pure state perspective and trying to find what are the alternatives of the locations that we have already -- and how does -- what are the synergies with this new vertical that we're pursuing. It's certainly not looking at what traditional health care companies are focused on. That's not our forte. That's not our strength. And that has really no interest to us today. But it is the value-based health care that a lot of forward thinking health care companies, operators, health care operators are pursuing. And the derivative of that will be the real estate. It could be our existing pharmacies that are going to be repositioned to health hubs and minute clinics. That's already happening. There's continued enhancement, there's continued higher impediments to switching costs that are getting created. Those are all perfect for us. That's embedded value that doesn't get realized day one, but we love to see that happen. And we also want to be intentional about growing the portfolio by doing the types of transactions that we did in the fourth quarter in this particular area because we do believe in it. We've certainly done redevelopment funding, Wes. If you look at our pipeline dollars today and some of that is repositioning of our existing assets. And we've done some in-house. We've done a lot of it with partners, national partners that we have. And those have been some of the best recapture rates that we have achieved in our portfolio. So when we talk about this 90% overlap in terms of real estate characteristics, of the locations that we currently own and some of these consumer-centric medical concepts, that certainly lends itself to repositioning some of our assets for highest and best use. And we define highest and best use in terms of rent per square foot that we could recapture for a given location that we already own. And so yes, I'd hope to be able to partner with these operators, show some of our existing vacancies, potential vacancies that are going to come down the pike. And reposition these locations to help provide these types of services. So yes, that is out of a value-enhancing proposition that we're going to explore. That's a very good question, Michael. It's a question that we've asked ourselves. There is a traditional definition of what a net lease company does. And yes, we can certainly be mandated and dictated by that or there was a way for us to step back and say, look, if we look at Realty Income, what is our core strength today, our size and scale, which people have continued to point to as impediments to growth. If you look at the last four years, we've grown our business at 5% CAGR annually. And if you look at the business, this question has been asked for the last 10 years was, we are going to take what has been used by The Street as an impediment and see if we can garner value for us shareholders, and let's just ask the question, what is it that we can do with the core strength of size, scale, cost of capital, that will be difficult for other companies to follow. And if the answer was, sorry, you're constrained by your business model and this is all you should do, and this is all you can do, that would have been the answer. But what we found once we started last the question around redefining this particular space is that there's plenty for us to do. And we are only constrained by our ability to be creative. And ultimately, if we continue to underwrite these verticals and look at it from the perspective of real estate and look at it from the perspective of a net lease suddenly, the answers that start to pop up are very different. And it allows you to do things and allows you to be very creative and create outsized riches for our shareholders. That with due respect, a lot of our peers are going to struggle trying to mimic. They just don't have the scale. And so, if we can help consolidate real estate, through a net lease structure, that is really the only governing principle that should be constraining us. And ultimately be able to show to the shareholders that on a risk-adjusted return, these are as safe, if not in some cases, safer than investing in traditional retail net lease businesses, then it's a win-win. So that's how we are thinking about the business, Michael. And you will continue to see us be very creative. But like I've always done, and like this team here has always done, we will engage with you to share our thesis. And by the way, I do highly encourage everyone to go to the new deck, the investor deck, where we've laid out our thesis in more detail, and you'll see some numbers around -- and you'll find that this is what I think people invest in Realty Income for, and we are just delivering on that promise. So John, the best way to answer that is any real estate development outside of a carve-out for one particular client that I mentioned already, which is a user of their end product, we basically get to take a look at the opportunity. And then if we wish not to pursue it, we don't have to. But we, as their real estate partner will be given an opportunity to look at any real estate development that they enter into over the next five or six years. There's a time frame associated with that. But ultimately, the goal here is to continue to invest because that would mean that they are becoming a more and more successful operator within vertical farming, and we are their real estate partner going forward. But yes, so it is a concept of the optionality lies with us in terms of how much more we invest. So it's not rated. It was a situation where you had the operator own both the operations as well as the real estate. And this was a mechanism for them to monetize their real estate and continue to invest in the operations of the business. I think we are very constrained by what it is that we can share. This was a highly negotiated transaction but it is one that we are very excited about. And this is, again, an advent into this consumer-centric medical real estate in a big way, and we felt like it was large enough for us to sort of engage in and talk about, but we can't be more specific than that. You know what our overall cap rate was for the quarter, and this was a very small component of it, given that it was a $4 million quarter. But that's the extent of what we can do about it. Greg is sitting right here, and he's already -- he's been with us about 1.5 months, and he's already added so much value to all of our discussions. It's very bright mind and now he's going to start blushing, but he's somebody that I've respected. I've known Greg for the last -- I guess now it's almost 15 years. And he has a perspective that he brings to the table that is very unique and is going to be incredibly additive to all of us. Look, our business is becoming more and more complicated. We are becoming a bigger and bigger organization. We need talented people to continue to that. But the most important thing about Greg, in my mind is his integrity and his ability to -- and his leadership qualities and his ability to mentor -- those are all qualities that will be put to good use, especially with the next batch of leaders that we are cultivating internally and he will be a massive help in accelerating them to very senior leadership positions within the Company, which, by the way, this company will need in order to continue to execute its strategy and plan. It depends on the type of leases that we have. I will tell you that, for example, an industrial lease tends to have structural and roof responsibilities, that's on the landlord. And so obviously, CapEx there, not maintenance CapEx necessarily, but just CapEx in general -- is going to be higher. Now some of it will be viewed as maintenance. Some of it will be viewed as improving the life of the real estate. So the categorization of that CapEx may be different, but it is very much a function of the lease. I would say that in the U.K., there is even on the retail side, there is not perfectly what we call quad net assets. So we do have a lot more leakage. But lot more leakage is a relative term to very little leakage here in the U.S. And so all said and done, it's not a big part of our business. It's something that we share. It's part of the AFFO. And again, all of that is underwritten when we are thinking about the long-term return profile of investments that we make, obviously take into consideration on the front end before moving forward on transactions. Yes. Tayo, it's not a perfect science. You've put forth two data points that we've shared with you that are polar opposites. How in this backdrop of uncertainty we have four-wall coverages that continue to improve, yet we are doing less and less of investment grade, but that goes back to the underwriting. And I already mentioned to you that there are a couple of retail names that are not investment-grade but to have coverages north of 5x. And again, it's a question of are these businesses that we are comfortable with. With the backdrop of this high interest rate environment, we are not going to be doing transactions where you're going to have an operator that doesn't have a business model that can sustain what we are going to experience, especially in the near term because that would not be good. You mean in terms of what we have in the earnings guidance? --: You missed it. Somebody else asked us about the watch list. It's right around 4%. You brought up Red Lobster, there were rumors around that Red Lobster was trying to negotiate rents with landlords, I can unequivocally tell you that, that is not the case, at least they haven't reached approached us. There certainly was assets that they have closed again, none of which impacted our portfolio. And there are some challenges with that operation. It represents about 1% of our rent. But again, I do think that some of the missteps that they had made in the third, fourth quarter of last year have essentially been reversed. They were slow to make pricing adjustments. They have rectified that. And they are managing their inventory much better and all of those should result in better performance. But I just wanted to make sure that we were talking about facts and not rumors that have percolated in the rumor mill. Well, thank you, Dave, for hosting us, and thank you, everyone, for joining in. I look forward to seeing you guys in the upcoming conferences. Take care."

We, if you noticed, did a three-year non-call one, giving us that flexibility after one year to call at par. We also did a one-year term loan, but what two one-year extension option. And so, what we're trying to avoid, especially since we went long on the curve earlier in 2022 with our debt capital raising efforts, what was the lock in rates that these levels are very attractive to us. We would like to think that over the next three years, there will be a more advantageous window for us to tap into the debt capital markets to term these amounts out. And so, it's really about maybe a little bit of a barbell given the activity we did earlier in the year, much lower long-term rates, but also terming out the revolver to an extent and creating that flexibility for us to participate and lower rates if they come."

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, that this event is being recorded. I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Andrea Behr, Corporate Communications Manager. Please go ahead.\nAndrea Behr: Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's third quarter operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; Christie Kelly, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Jonathan Pong, Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Finance. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company's Form 10-Q. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy.\nSumit Roy: Thank you, Andrea. Welcome everyone. At Realty Income, we pride ourselves in having a consistent and dependable business model. For 53 years as an operating company, we have persevered through a variety of macroeconomic climates and our track record of stability notably during periods of volatility is particularly relevant during current times. We sit here today well positioned and operating very well across all areas of our business. We are grateful for all of our team members who make the success possible. To start off, we capitalized on opportunities to bolster our balance sheet in the third quarter, including raising over $2 billion of equity on the ATM with approximately $700 million of proceeds received during the third quarter as well as over $1.3 billion remaining subject to our settlement on a forward basis in alignment with our capital strategy. In addition, we issued $750 million of 10-year senior unsecured notes in October to further increase our liquidity. Between cash and cash equivalents, our availability under our credit facility, our liquidity as of the end of the third quarter was over $2.5 billion, which when combined with the $1.3 billion of our unsettled forward equity and approximately $744 million in net bond proceeds equates to liquidity of approximately $4.6 billion had the forwards and net bond proceeds being received at quarter end. Moving on to acquisitions. During the quarter, we acquired approximately $1.9 billion in high-quality real estate, bringing us to approximately $5.1 billion in acquisitions year-to-date. A significant portion of the properties purchased in Q3 were part of portfolio deals or large transactions. We believe these deals were accessible to us because of our size, scale, relationships, ability to close, access to and cost of capital together with our research and technology-driven analytic capabilities. For Realty Income, our competitive advantages allow us to design and execute on strategies that benefit all those we serve including our clients. The pending $1.7 billion Encore Boston Harbor transaction, which we continue to expect to close this year remains an example of this dynamic. Based on our current total portfolio annualized base rent, the transaction would comprise approximately 3% of our total portfolio annualized contractual rent, once closed. Further leveraging our international capabilities, we made our advent into Italy last week investing approximately \u20ac165 million in seven high-performing wholesale clubs, operated by Metro AG in major Italian cities like Rome and Florence. Metro is a pan-European leader in the wholesale club industry and operates almost 700 stores across Europe. Metro is publicly listed and investment-grade rated, and has continued to perform well during and since the pandemic. We are delighted to add them as a client and hope we will be able to add to this initial portfolio over time. During the third quarter, we did experience cap rate expansion registering a 6.1% cash cap rate on investments, which compares favorably to the 5.7% cap rate we realized our investments in the second quarter. This resulted in a third quarter investment spread, of 165 basis points based on actual capital raised, which is higher than our year-to-date total of 161 basis points and above our historical average. As we move towards year-end, we continue to see cap rates push higher as capital costs increase. This is consistent with the historical correlation we've come to expect, which has tended to preserve investment spreads as the market adjusts. Transaction flow remains strong with sourcing volume totaling approximately $18 billion this quarter, bringing year-to-date sourcing volume approximately $78 billion. We remain selective as we have acquired approximately 6.5% of sourced volume year-to-date. The international market continues to be an important part of our strategy and it remains an active component of our volume, representing approximately 33% of investment volume in the third quarter. Capital recycling continues to be a strong component of our funding strategy, which also has the dual purpose of culling noncore properties from the portfolio. During the third quarter, we sold 34 properties generating net sale proceeds of $142 million, at an unlevered IRR of 12.8% illustrating the full cycle attractiveness of owning net lease real estate under long-term leases.  We intend to continue to act opportunistically to dispose of assets at moments in time when we can obtain attractive risk-adjusted returns. In addition to the disposition of properties on our balance sheet, we also sold our interest in seven properties owned in an industrial JV that we assumed as part of our VEREIT merger. The gross purchase price totaled $905 million, at a low 4% cap rate. Our share of net sale proceeds was approximately $113.5 million. Our core portfolio continues to perform and by and large our clients have generally continued to perform very well despite the cyclical market changes and shifts in consumer behavior. A point to note, as previously publicly announced one of our clients Cineworld commenced Chapter 11 bankruptcy in September. Despite being one of its largest landlords, Cineworld represented only 1.5% of our total portfolio annualized base rent as of Q3. We'll continue working closely with Cineworld, as this process continues towards resolution. For some color regarding theaters, for the third quarter 2022, we collected approximately 85% of the contractual rent across our theater portfolio, as Cineworld Group plc was not yet required to pay rent for the month of September. For the month of October 2022, we have collected 100% of the contractual rent across our theater clients including Cineworld. For some specifics, our Cineworld portfolio consists of 41 properties, 17 of which are subject to a single master lease agreement and 22 of which have been accounted for under cash basis accounting since the third quarter of 2020. Through September, we have recognized $23.5 million of cumulative reserves on these properties, representing primarily contractual rent and expense recoveries that have not been collected, dating back to the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. These 22 properties on cash basis accounting currently account for approximately $1.6 million of monthly contractual base rent or 40% of our total exposure to Cineworld. Based on current public information and our internal analysis, we continue to believe our portfolio of Cineworld assets are generally comprised of the stronger performance in the operator's portfolio. Our locations are freestanding, single-tenant assets, typically with large land areas and close proximity to population centers, supporting potential conversion to residential, industrial or life science uses. We have received reverse inquiries from multifamily and industrial developers exploring opportunities on these sites. We believe there is alternative and adaptive reuse potential if Regal were to vacate any locations as part of bankruptcy. Moving on to some of the most important key operational metrics, delivering value that continue to demonstrate a consistent well-positioned real estate portfolio. At the end of the third quarter our occupancy was 98.9%. In Q3, we released 169 leases and achieved a rent recapture rate of 108.5%, bringing our year-to-date recapture rate to 106.7%. As we look forward, less than 4% of our contractual base rent comes due through the end of 2023, providing strong visibility into our near-term portfolio performance. At quarter end, approximately 43% of our portfolio's total annualized contractual rent was generated from investment-grade rated clients. Our properties leased to clients in our portfolio watch list represented less than 4% of our portfolio's annualized contractual rent. Lastly, our same-store rental revenue increased 1% during the quarter and 2.4% year-to-date and we continue to expect full year same-store growth to be approximately 2%. At this time I'll pass it over to Christie, who will further discuss results from the quarter.\nChristie Kelly: Thank you, Sumit. Put simply, it was another productive quarter for us. In the third quarter our business generated $0.98 per share of AFFO, representing 7.7% year-over-year growth. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDAR was 5.3 times or 5.2 times giving effect to the annualization of net investment activity during the quarter. These ratios do not reflect the $1.3 billion in outstanding equity forwards we had at quarter end. As Sumit previously mentioned, we were both active and prudent in our capital-raising efforts since the end of the second quarter. In addition to raising over $2 billion during the quarter at an initial weighted average price of approximately $68 per share, subsequent to quarter end, we completed a $750 million bond transaction, the majority of which served as a synthetic euro offering to take advantage of favorable foreign exchange dynamics, while also allowing us to return to the US dollar public fixed income market, which we last accessed in 2020. In conjunction with this offering, we executed a US$600 million to euro 10-year cross-currency swap, resulting in the receipt of approximately $612 million in euro proceeds, an effective fixed rate euro-denominated semiannual yield to maturity of 4.7%. Additionally, giving effect to $500 million of interest rate hedges, which were terminated with the operated, we generated a $72 million cash settlement gain at pricing, which when amortized over the 10-year tenure of the note is expected to result in an effective semiannual yield to maturity of 3.93%. Financial flexibility has long been a hallmark of our strategy and our ability to move between various financing markets given our international capital needs is a competitive advantage. As previously reported in the third quarter, we upsized our US commercial paper program from $1 billion to $1.5 billion and established a euro commercial paper program with a capacity of $1.5 billion. The combined $3 billion commercial paper program, which is backstopped by our multicurrency $4.25 billion revolving credit facility, gives us the flexibility to efficiently match fund our short-term funding needs in various currencies at much lower rates than comparable US facility borrowings. As we look forward, we have limited near-term refinancing risk as only $23 million of mortgage debt comes due through the end of 2023 and our next unsecured debt maturity is not until 2024. With continued stable and consistent results in the quarter, we tightened our AFFO guidance range by $0.06 to $3.87 to $3.94, maintaining the midpoint at a 9% year-over-year growth rate, consistent with what we initially provided a year ago. As the monthly dividend company Realty Income's dividend will remain sacrosanct to our mission. This is a testament to our confidence in the time-tested consistency of our business model, supported by a conservative balance sheet and diverse real estate portfolio leased to clients that are leaders in their respective industries. In September, we increased the dividend for the 117th time and for the 100th consecutive quarter, representing a 5.1% increase compared to the dividend declared one year ago. We are proud of these accomplishments and the work our talented colleagues perform every day to help drive this consistent track record. Earlier this week, we celebrated the one-year anniversary of our VEREIT merger. We've grown together as one team over the last year and I'm pleased that we remain on track to realize over $50 million in run rate annual cost synergies that we estimated when we announced the merger. And with that, I would like to pass the call back to Sumit.\nSumit Roy: Thank you Christie. Our strengths have been accentuated in this quarter's result. While we cannot control the macroeconomic forces that periodically introduce volatility in the capital markets, I am regularly reminded that the resiliency of this team and the inherent stability of our business model allows us to look to the future with confidence. I'm pleased that we are able to lean in to market conditions when it's advantageous to serve our shareholders, and I believe that the best is still ahead of us. At this time, we can open it up for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. Now we\u2019ll begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Brad Heffern, RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nBrad Heffern: Hey, good morning out there, everyone. Cap rates on acquisitions were up 50 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Looks like some of that's related to the mix of industrial and investment grade, but can you talk about how much of that was underlying market cap rates moving? And was there a particular goal to pursue higher cap rates to preserve accretion?\nSumit Roy: It's more the former than the latter. We are definitely seeing movement in cap rates. If we were to compare it to what -- where the environment was at the beginning of the year, which is what I would say we saw over the last couple of years and compare it to cap rates that we are seeing today and what we experienced in the third quarter, I would say retail cap rates have moved circa 100 basis points. And it's a story of basically two ends of the credit spectrum. If you think about the high investment grade grocery assets those at the beginning of the year were trading in the low four cap rate range and those have moved the most. I would say today they are in the 5.5% maybe even in the 5.6% ZIP code. So that's about 150 basis points. And then on the other end of the spectrum, it was the higher yielding cap rates that had compressed quite a bit over the last few years that also saw similar movement. But the stuff that was in between has seen movements circa of 100 basis points and that's really what is starting to translate into actual realized cap rates that you noticed for the third quarter. Having said all of that, things don't happen at the spur of the moment. I mean, a lot of these transactions -- we started to have discussions with our potential clients about the movement that we were seeing in our cost of capital, which was quite brutal and quite immediate. And thanks to the relationships, thanks to our ability to close all of the things that I enumerated in my prepared remarks, some of the more institutional type clients were also experiencing similar dynamics and we're more than willing to adjust cap rates to continue to do business and continue to fund their respective businesses. And I think that's what you saw translating to the 40 basis points of increased cap rate that we were able to realize in the third quarter. But it is a timing thing. I just want to be very careful that depending on -- if for instance if the gaming asset in Boston, if that were to have closed in the third quarter that's already been sort of -- it's a transaction that's going to have a 5.9% cap rate that's going to sway the overall cap rate. So, it really is a question of when did those transactions get under contract and what is the timing of close that's going to dictate, what the quarter results are. But having said all of that, I think we are definitely seeing movement and it is in the quantum that I described earlier. It's a similar story on the industrial side. I would say, that industrial cap rates have also moved considerably and this is something that we started seeing even in the early part of the year. I think in my first quarter comments, I had talked about maybe seeing a 25 to 50 basis point movement. This was on the heels of Amazon announcing, that they are no longer going to be big takers of industrial assets. They accounted for about 20% of the volume, over the last few years. That started to see some movement -- that resulted in some movement on the industrial side. And then that movement continued through the second quarter. And I'll say today, despite what we quoted in our joint venture that we sold in the low 4s, I would say, similar assets that we were pursuing are in the 5.5 ZIP code today. So, there's clearly movement. And the hope is that the movement will continue in the right direction, over the next coming months. And our portfolio is a testament -- our portfolio, as well as our pipeline is a testament to that.\nBrad Heffern: Okay. Appreciate the detailed answer. Christie, I was hoping you could walk through the puts and takes on the new guide. Obviously, you had headwinds from FX and from higher rates. I'm curious, what the offsetting factors were they kept the midpoint the same. Thanks.\nChristie Kelly: I think Brad, you captured the headwinds together with the strengthening US dollar. I think in terms of where we see opportunity, is first as it relates to the determination on our AFFO per share, is the overall developments and as it relates to our clients that are on cash accounting. I just want to note that for Regal, we have no change associated with the status of Regal and in the midpoint of our guidance are expecting full collection. A couple of other things, is also just our access to the international borrowings, which are a nice tailwind and you can see that demonstrated in what we were able to do with the euro commercial paper program. And as Sumit articulated, our relationships with clients our ability to pivot in the marketplace, together with our strong pipeline and the timing of the Encore transaction, which could be a positive or a negative. Hope that helps, Brad. \nBrad Heffern: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question will be from R.J. Milligan of Raymond James. Please go ahead. \nR.J. Milligan: Hi, good afternoon. I'll start with my boiler plate question for the quarter, and certainly appreciate the attractively priced capital, you guys were able to source in 3Q, but I'm curious how you view your current weighted average cost of capital and what kind of spreads you've been able to achieve here quarter-to-date. \nSumit Roy: Yes. So, the spread we were able to achieve third quarter year-to-date was right around 161 basis points and this is based on actual capital raised throughout the year. And for the quarter, it was closer to 165 basis points. And one of the things I'll point to is that in our investor deck, I believe it's Page 26, we do lay out precisely how we calculate our cost of capital. And there are basically three components to it, one of which is the free cash flow that we are generating. -- as well as the cost of equity loaded for the cost of raising that equity and our bond prices. But there was a strange thing that played out in the third quarter, and I don't know if I've got this fact 100% right, but we reached a 52-week high as well as our 52-week low during the third quarter. That was the level of volatility that we experienced, and we will call it luck, call it Jonathan Pong doing his thing, -- we were able to raise a lot of our equity capital on a forward basis with an average price of $68, and that's $2 billion worth of equity 700 of which we obviously was able to -- we were able to close and settle at the end of the third quarter and $1.3 billion of which we will settle at the end of the fourth quarter. And so that's the reason why I want to be very precise around the actual realized spread versus what traditionally has been a calculation of average WACC over a given period. This is the first quarter where we felt like there was a massive diversion precisely driven by the volatility that I just spoke about. But yes, that's how we calculate our WACC.\nR.J. Milligan: That's helpful. And so given the fact that cap rates in general are starting to move higher, but probably not as quickly as the cost of debt. How are you thinking about acquisition volume as we move into 2023? Is it time to maybe tap the brakes, sort of keep the pace, or do you think there's going to be more opportunities to potentially even accelerate the pace?\nSumit Roy: Yes. R.J., it's going to be a function of how quickly the cap rates adjust. Clearly, there are mechanisms available to us on the capital side on the financing side that we are going to avail of -- but that's limited in terms of what is the ultimate spread that we can realize. And we are being incredibly disciplined around making sure that the team is pivoting to hurdle rates that we need to achieve on the cap rate side in order to continue to maintain spreads that we feel like represents the right spread for the kind of risk that we are taking based on the acquisitions that we are pursuing. And I think I mentioned this in the second quarter, but I'll say it again, I have been pleasantly surprised with how quickly cap rates have moved. And again, based on some of the transactions that we are seeing in our pipeline, we are very optimistic that we'll be able to continue to maintain the spreads that we have historically maintained -- and we see that over the continuing next few quarters. But timing will be of the essence. Like I said, if there are certain transactions that we entered into, especially on the development side, that was 12 months ago, those are going to not be quite as accretive as transactions that we are entering into today, which will potentially close in the fourth quarter and some of which will close in the first quarter that have spreads that are more in line with what our historical spreads have been. So timing is going to be of the essence in terms of what we report at the end of a given quarter.\nR.J. Milligan: Make sense. Thank you for the color.\nSumit Roy: Thank you, R.J.\nOperator: Thanks. Next question will be from Greg McGinniss, Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nGreg McGinniss: Hi. Good afternoon. Sumit, deal sourcing is still significant, but it's also slowed each quarter in 2022 even, while potentially casting a wider net internationally. What are the drivers of that trend? And do you expect it to continue that way into Q4 in 2023? And how might that declining investment opportunities impact acquisition levels and cap rates? \nSumit Roy: Yes. It's a good question Greg. And it goes back to having sticky sellers. Sellers who haven't quite embraced the changing cost of capital environment, who are hoping for this to have a shorter duration disruption and starting to recognize that given what the Fed is doing, given what they're seeing on the inflation side that this may be a longer process than what they had anticipated. I think that is part of the reason why you saw a tailing off on the sourcing side. We were averaging around $30 billion per quarter. Third quarter I would still claim was quite robust with $18 billion worth of sourcing, one-third of which was from the international market. And so on a relative basis, yes, there was a bit of a slowing down and it's largely being driven by the time it takes for sellers to adjust to the new environment. And there too it really is a story of those that are institutional sellers they are able to adjust to it a lot quicker than some of the non-institutional more private owners of real estate for whom it has taken and will take a little bit more time to adjust. \nGreg McGinniss: Great. That's fair. Then just going back to the portfolio deals or transactions that you mentioned in your opening remarks. Can you provide a little more detail on the size of some of those deals asset types and whether that's maybe trend that you expect us to move into maybe that seller is just more willing to accept the current financing environment for what it is? \nSumit Roy: Yes. I think, the way I'll answer that question is to say in large portfolio deals, which tend to be owned by institutional owners they're far more receptive to the changing cap rate environment and far more accepting of the changing cap rate environment. And so it will come as no surprise to you that over 70% of what we did were portfolio deals in the third quarter. It should also come as no surprise to you that some of the institutional owners of real estate were far more willing to enter into sale leaseback as an alternative source of raising capital, especially, given their traditional sources of capital which may have been the leverage finance market or the high-yield market and the disruption that they saw there. And so about 50% of what we did in the third quarter were largely -- were sale-leaseback transactions. And so I think that will give you a flavor for some of the transactions that we did. It was still mostly I want to say 94% was retail and there was about 4%, 4.5% of industrial assets that we did, but largely driven by what we are seeing on the retail side. \nGreg McGinniss: Great. Thank you.\nSumit Roy: Sure.\nOperator: Next question will be from Michael Goldsmith UBS. Please go ahead.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. International acquisitions represent about 33% maybe lighter than what we've been seeing. The opportunity set just larger in the US now relative to Europe. Or are you seeing anything in Europe that you want to highlight in terms of pricing or sentiment and recognize that also comes at the time when you moved into Italy? \nSumit Roy: I'll tell you Michael I mean we were doing north of 50% in the international markets in the first quarter. We did north of 50% in the second quarter. We are at one-third of the total volume in the third quarter. Again, it really is a function of the timing of close et cetera. Having said that, I will say that the sellers in the US are far more accepting of the changing financing environment than perhaps in Europe. And Europe is by country. It's a smaller market. And so it does take a little bit longer for things to adjust. Having said all of that, we are finding very good opportunities in the UK. And now with the advent into Italy I believe that momentum will continue. Because for precisely some of the reasons that I think we touched on during the second quarter, the debt markets are very unsettled. It has a very high cost associated with it. And that's driving some of the transactions actually on both sides of the pond. But one of the additional dynamics that we are seeing play out in Europe is some of the pressures that some of the funds are feeling. And in order for them to raise the appropriate level of capital, monetizing real estate is creating opportunities for us. And so I wouldn't read too much into it. There is still a very, very healthy pipeline that we have within Realty Income. And the sourcing volumes continue to be yes, lower than what we saw in the first half but still very healthy. \nMichael Goldsmith: Thank you, Sumit. And as a follow-up grocery is in your top 10 industries. Kroger is one of your top 10 clients. Does consolidation in the grocery industry give you any pause or change your opinion about kind of the future of this sector and as a product type within your portfolio? Thanks.\nSumit Roy: Sure, Michael. Look I mean anytime you have consolidation the question needs to be asked who is doing the consolidation? If Kroger is going out there and this is a publicly announced transaction with regards to Albertsons, Kroger is still BBB rated. S&P reaffirmed the rating, although they did put it on a negative outlook. And they're acquiring Albertsons, which is a BB-rated credit still solid rated. But I don't necessarily see that as a bad thing. Now there are obviously a lot of other social issues that we have to also address and take into consideration. But from a pure credit standpoint it's actually -- it's a stronger outcome for us that suddenly 30 basis points that we have of Albertsons that has a BB credit associated with it, is now going to get enhanced to a BBB rating. So from a purely a credit perspective, that's not necessarily a bad outcome for us, but that obviously doesn't address a lot of other issues that should be addressed. And I think is percolating through the markets today, around the viability of this combination. But by and large there isn't a standard answer that all consolidation is good. It really does depend on the specific situations.\nMichael Goldsmith: Got it. Thank you very much.\nSumit Roy: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we have a question from Wes Golladay of Baird. Please go ahead.\nWes Golladay: Hey everyone. Just a question on the hedging, a lot of the ForEx volatility and interest rate volatility is that making it easier or harder for you to hedge cost effectively?\nJonathan Pong: Hey Wes, it's Jonathan. Look it's been a very volatile FX environment as we certainly saw in the third quarter. I wouldn't necessarily say that's been harder to hedge. I mean, these are all very liquid currencies that we're looking to hedge going out very short-term. And so from that dynamic, yes, it's difficult to understand where these rates might be going but the mechanism itself nothing has really changed. On the hedging front, I would say that when you look out the next 12 months we are around 50% hedged at this point on earnings. And we aspire to get to our hedging program where hopefully going forward rates aren't the story -- FX rates aren't the story of any quarterly earnings. So rest assured we're very mindful of that.\nWes Golladay: Got it. And I want to touch upon Regal. It sounds like you're pretty optimistic under an adverse scenario for the cash basis tenets. So I guess question number one do you overall expect a positive outcome here? And then question -- part two of the question was for the master lease asset. That's -- and all are typically is how we view it. In your history is that typically the case where do these ever get negotiated for a modest haircut? I guess, what should we embrace for based on historical precedent?\nSumit Roy: So Wes, there isn't one single answer that can address the master lease question. It is very much jurisdictionally dependent, depending on where the bankruptcy is playing out. And in this case, I think, I believe, it's in Texas. It's a function of how they're going to interpret the strength of the master lease. But yes, having a master lease certainly does accrue certain benefits to us. And it should be viewed as an all or nothing situation. But we can't guarantee that going forward. We'll see how it all plays out. With regards to Regal and the ultimate outcome, you read a fair amount of optimism into some of our prepared remarks and when we have answered questions directly. That is a true read. I'm not saying that, Regal will continue to run 41 assets when they emerge from Chapter 11 but what I am telling you is the ultimate economic outcome, on this portfolio, we feel very comfortable about. And a lot of it has largely been driven by unsolicited inbounds that we have been receiving, even on some of the assets that we recognized to be not very good performers and recognizing that the best use for these assets perhaps may not be a theater asset going forward but something totally different. And when you start to look at where these are located the amount of land in some cases north of 10 acres creating a mixed use or a multifamily makes it tremendous amounts. And value creation opportunities for us to partner with some of these developers can create a lot of value for us. Yes, it's going to take time, but we feel fairly optimistic that the ultimate economic outcome on this portfolio will be one that we will be very comfortable with.\nWes Golladay: Got it. Thank you very much for that.\nSumit Roy: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question will be from Ronald Kamdem, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRonald Kamdem: Hey. Just a couple of quick ones. Just back to sort of the tenant health. You sort of talked about Regal which was really good disclosure. But any sort of other tenants that are of material size whether it's 50 basis points, 100 basis points on the watch list that we should be thinking about? And how are you guys -- and can you just update us on what the reserve for bad debt is looking like so far year-to-date?\nSumit Roy: Yes, I'll take the question around do we have more than 50 basis points -- 50 basis points for any other clients outside of Regal and the answer is no, we don't. Our total watch list is less than 4%. It's actually 3.9%. And we don't have any large clients on this watch list outside of Regal. Regal is the largest one. We do have some other clients on this in the health and fitness industry et cetera. But again from an overall perspective we feel pretty good about it. In terms of -- I'll have Christie answer the other part of your question. \nChristie Kelly: In terms of reserves Ron total reserves are $33 million. And just dovetailing with what Sumit said in regards to the watch list and what we've already made publicly available it's really primarily a story around Regal and the reserves that we have on the books associated with Regal. \nRonald Kamdem: Great. And if I could sneak in -- my second one was just look if you take a step back and you think about sort of the company the balance sheet when the rest of the capital markets are sort of challenged it seems like this should be the environment where you guys can thrive and I think you sort of mentioned some of that in your opening comments. But I guess my question is just going back to sort of the acquisition volumes and the cap rate, just trying to get a sense of how much sort of pricing power, how much can you guys actually ask for higher cap rates right thinking could this be 25, 50, 75 basis points cap rate higher given that you do have such sort of advantaged cost of capital when others are looking for it?\nSumit Roy: Ron I don't want to overstate the environment. You just need one other competitor to come in and undercut what the normal situation would dictate in terms of cap rates to continue to keep a lid on cap rates. Having said all of that, if you look at the trend lines, there is no doubt that cap rates are moving and they're moving much faster than -- and I've said this before -- than what I expected. It is also true that clients with whom we have relationships, we've been able to enter into contracts with them, where we've asked even from where we first started, and didn't have a contract to when they came back and reengaged with us and said, look, the cost of capital environment has changed for us. This is what we'll be able to do. They're still chosen to work with us, exclusively, and these tend to be larger transactions. So, there is no doubt that having fewer competitors out there, who have the cost of capital to be able to transact that spreads that would be acceptable to their investors, creates an opportunity for us. And this is a relative gain. We have been able to move cap rates, but I think it would be overstating, if I were to tell you that everything that happens going forward, we are going to be the beneficiary of. That's not the case. But we will do better than our share. I think that, Ron you can take away from what I'm saying.\nRonald Kamdem: Great. Thanks so much.\nSumit Roy: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question will be from Harsh Hemnani of Green Street. Please go ahead.\nHarsh Hemnani: Thanks. Going back to the portfolio transactions piece, your peers have pointed out that there's a trade-off between acquisition volume in cap rates. You can always drive higher volume on cap rates in the fives. But it seems like because of the ability to drive larger portfolio deals you can drive both higher volumes than them at higher pricing. So, I guess, could you point out, how much of \u2013 how many basis points of pickup you can get on a portfolio transaction versus maybe a one-off single transaction deal? And how long you think, it will take for these higher cap rates to show up in the single transaction market?\nSumit Roy: Yeah. Harsh, that's a very difficult question. But if you are forcing me to answer that question, I would say, anywhere in the region of 20 to 30 basis points, 35 basis points. And if that \u2013 if the transaction size continues to be bigger and bigger, you're going to start going beyond that is how you should think about it. There is a dearth in this particular environment of potential buyers being able to write large checks, and that is our single biggest advantage today, along with the fact that obviously on a relative basis our cost of capital has held up. But it is going to be very much asset-by-asset, portfolio-by-portfolio discussion in terms of what is that delta between the one-off market and the portfolio market. In terms of how long is it going to take, I'll tell you that, a Chick-fil-A \u2013 15 year Chick-fil-A will still trade in the force today. There is enough buyers \u2013 private buyers who can write a check for $5 million or $4 million who don't necessarily need to rely on the debt markets in order to do so. And so it's a tough question to answer in terms of how quickly the one-off market is going to adjust. There will be an adjustment, there's no doubt because even a lot of the private buyers would lean on the debt markets to finance some of their asset purchase. But it's tough for me to \u2013 I mean, I saw this Chick-fil-A example literally a week ago, and I asked the team what is the ask and what do you think it's going to trade at. And the answer was mid-4s. And so how long will it take for that to adjust? Who knows? The good news here is it helps us on the disposition side. And if we have one-off assets that we feel like we can take advantage of this market we'll certainly do so. It's not a big part of our business. But like I said more than 70% of what we buy are portfolio deals. And so there I think we are getting the kind of differential that it warrants. And so we continue to focus on that side of the business.\nHarsh Hemnani : Thanks. And then just considering the timing of moving into Italy, you mentioned that cap rates in Europe haven't reacted as much as those in the US, and it seems like the economic outlook might be slightly worse for Europe tenets as in the US. Given that backdrop what caused you to enter Italy today? And I guess, more importantly, what prompted the debt swap that was swapped into euros which suggests that maybe you're expanding more into Europe?\nSumit Roy : Well, certainly part of that swap was to help finance, the transactions that we have in Europe including the one that we did with Metro. Look that's a fantastic transaction. We started having conversations around this transaction if I want to -- maybe at the beginning of this year perhaps even late last year. And it's a very interesting geography Italy is. It's the fourth largest GDP in Europe. It is one that we feel like, we can find these types of transactions with investment-grade rated or highly rated operators executing very good businesses, who are looking for real estate partners. And that's the reason why we find Italy to be very fascinating. And we haven't disclosed the cap rates. But suffice it to say it was a very healthy cap rate. And even in this environment is allowing us to capture spreads that are very acceptable to us. The point about Europe that I want you to take away is not so much that cap rates taking longer to adjust. It is adjusting. It will take longer. But to your point I think the pain in Europe is going to be a lot longer than the pain that we are planning on experiencing here in the US. And therefore it will create opportunities. And we want to be front in line to take advantage of those opportunities. And I think under Neil's tutelage, the team is very comfortable continuing to cultivate the relationships that they have established and -- in some of the areas that we would like to grow our business. That work is already being is already underway. And so this is going to continue to be a very important area of growth for our business. And I want to remind you Harsh, when you think about when we first went into the UK, this was in 2019, retail was not in favor. Brexit has dominated the conversation and we were able to do deals that subsequent to us having done those deals, cap rates compressed to the tune of 70 basis points 80 basis points perhaps even more. And so we are going to be opportunistic. We are going to position ourselves and use our inherent competitive advantages to execute transactions where it makes sense. But yes, we will be very diligent and very selective. But we didn't enter Europe to shy away when things got rough. We believe the exact opposite that, it's going to be at times like this and what we believe will happen in Europe over the next 12 months that will create opportunities for us.\nHarsh Hemnani: Great. Thank you.\nSumit Roy: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question will be from Linda Tsai of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nLinda Tsai: Hi. Thank you. Just a point of clarification. So in terms of the $31 million and the outstanding receivables from Regal, is that all factored into your reserve of $33 million?\nChristie Kelly: From the perspective of the reserves Linda, we took reserves on Regal as we had communicated of $23 million. And there, another $30 million of outstanding receivables associated with Regal to clarify.\nLinda Tsai: Okay. But then your -- the reserves you have right now, for just tenants on your watch list are $33 million?\nChristie Kelly: In terms of the total, we have for the watch list is $33 million, of which $23 million is Regal. And the remainder, as you would understand is primarily health and fitness.\nLinda Tsai: Okay. Thank you. And then just in terms of the recapture rate, that was very strong the 108%, could you just talk about what's driving this overall? It's been strong pretty much all year.\nSumit Roy: Yes. Linda, I think it's a testament to the team. It's a testament to us controlling more assets for given operators. There is certainly, a drop of -- switching costs have gotten much higher for a lot of our clients. One of the things that we would compete with is the ability for our clients to basically say, I'm going to go and build the new asset down the road. And that's going to be a better outcome. But now, given the inflationary environment, given the construction costs, the switching cost hurdles have certainly crept up. And the fact that we do have 11,700 assets, we tend to control a lot more of the assets for a given client. And so, not talking about leverage, but we can have a much more holistic conversation with clients that not only take into account near-term resolutions but mid-term resolutions as well and come up with a win-win situation and therefore, be able to get the kind of re-leasing spreads that we have. Having said all of that, it is quite -- I'm very happy that we were able to do 108%, but it is -- I don\u2019t want to view it as an outlier. But if you look at the history of the company since we've been reporting this, we've basically been right around 100%, 101% net of re-leasing spreads. So this on a proportionate basis is certainly higher, and I think it's a testament to the environment we find ourselves.\nLinda Tsai: Do you think this continues for next year?\nSumit Roy: I think near term, you can expect us to continue to be in this particular ZIP code. The one thing that I will say that we are looking into is, especially in an environment like this, we will be a little bit more receptive to looking at clients. And, look, this is an analysis that we do across the portfolio, what is the best economic outcome. Renewing with an existing client based on the 5% increase, engaging with an existing client that is asking for a 10% reduction from where it's closing and then looking at the alternative of selling the assets and putting the proceeds to use in the current cap rate environment. Once we go through that decision tree and let's also throw in repositioning of the asset as a fourth variable, we decide what is the most favorable outcome. And so far, the outcome that -- for the last few years has been resulting in north of 103%, 104%, 105% of re-leasing spreads, but it is possible that it might revert back to 100% or 101%, because it is more favorable for us to keep an existing client, while taking a bit of a haircut. But over the next six to eight months, I still believe that we'll be north of 100% in terms of recapture rate.\nLinda Tsai: Thank you.\nSumit Roy: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question will be from Nick Joseph from Citi. Please, go ahead.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. Sumit, you talked about the volatility, obviously, in your shares, but also really across the space. And so, at this point, there're some diverging multiples in cost of capital. So hoping to get your thoughts on M&A broadly within the sector and then your appetite for it. \nSumit Roy: Yes. Nick, if you can point to candidates who'd be willing to engage in conversations around M&A today, this can be a very interesting time to discuss that. But I suspect that a lot of the management team, Nick, would be very focused on trying to run their business trying to make sure that they emerge from this particular economic environment stronger, so that they can engage in M&A transactions. But theoretically speaking, M&A is something that one should absolutely consider, especially if it's a 100% stock deal and you don't have an over-reliance on the public markets on the debt side to help finance. And if your relative cost of capital is stronger, which in our case, under most circumstances, it is, and that is something that would be very attractive to us. It's just -- it'll be difficult and I'm just -- it's a hypothetical comment I'm making. It'd be difficult to see management teams of potential companies wanting to engage in that sort of discussion in this environment.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. And I completely understand that it takes two there, but that's helpful. And then just -- I know we've talked a lot on cap rates. You called out the casino deal that is still expected to close later this year. I think you mentioned a 5.9% cap rate that was struck earlier. Where would that be struck today do you think? How much cap rate expansion would you expect kind of on the casino cycle?\nSumit Roy: Yes. You tell me, Nick. You cover all the gaming companies. And what I'm seeing is that, they've all gotten repriced. And I don't know if we did them the favor or what, but they're trading at levels that I don't know if there'll be a lot of movement from, where we entered into the win -- the Encore Boston Harbor asset. But, look, I still think that that is a wonderful asset. We underwrote it about a year ago now -- well, not quite, almost a year ago with a profile of about $210 million in EBITDA and it is already performing at a $250 million EBITDA and I still don't believe that it has fully stabilized, especially with gaming -- sports betting sorry being legalized. So I don't know if I would say to you Nick that that five nine would be dramatically different today, but we haven't seen an asset like that yet. So difficult for me to opine on that.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. And where do you think it closes?\nSumit Roy: We are hopeful and that's one of the things that we talked about on the earnings guidance. We are expecting to close in the fourth quarter. That remains our conviction. But really as to when in the fourth quarter remains a bit of a question mark, but we still believe that it will close in the fourth quarter. And I have a very high conviction on that front. \nNick Joseph: Thank you very much.\nSumit Roy: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question will be from John Massocca, Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead.\nJohn Massocca: Good afternoon.\nSumit Roy: Hi, John.\nJohn Massocca: So just a quick one for me. It sounds like you were surprised by how kind of receptive cap rate environment has been to interest rate changes. Have you seen that kind of same receptiveness to maybe higher escalators particularly on retail transactions?\nSumit Roy: Yes, we have. It's still difficult here in the US to get untethered or uncapped CPIs, especially given the environment that we are in and retail tends to be a low-margin business, but there is far more receptivity to getting higher interest rate -- higher -- what do... \nChristie Kelly: Escalators.\nSumit Roy: Escalators. Thank you. Higher escalators in our leases today than it was perhaps 12 months ago. The same discussion on escalators in Europe, it is a lot more easier for us to engage and get CPI-type adjustments. And in fact, the Metro transaction that we talked about has CPI escalators built into the lease. And so I think those are easier in Europe than it is here, but we are starting to see the seller being more willing to give us higher escalators than what we have traditionally seen in this space.\nJohn Massocca: In terms of the fixed escalators on kind of US investments, particularly retail, any kind of brackets on how much they've increased maybe versus last year or even pre-pandemic?\nSumit Roy: Yeah. John. Again, it's going to be a function of the type of retail. The higher-yielding stuff is going to tend to have higher elevation, higher escalators. The investment-grade guys -- it's still going to be tough. Maybe they'll be willing to give you fixed bumps every five years, which perhaps they wouldn't have 12 months ago. But I mean it's difficult for me to quantify the exact amount of increase in this environment. What I can tell you is we are seeing increases.\nJohn Massocca: Understandable. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you very much.\nSumit Roy: Thanks, John.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Next question will be from Chris Lucas, Capital One Securities. Please go ahead.\nChris Lucas: Sorry for the long call. Just two quick ones for me, Sumit you talked a little bit about or actually frequently about the Encore transaction. The question I have is just, are you just waiting for regulatory approval? And once that occurs, you can close immediately, or is there some other timing issue related to the close?\nSumit Roy: That is it Chris. It really is waiting on the regulators to give us a thumbs up. And once we have that, then we'll be in a position to close.\nChris Lucas: Okay. And then Christie just a quick one for me. The -- I guess the other adjustments was about $0.04 a share, which is huge. Not a lot of detail there. Can you give me some color as to what that breakdown was, I know foreign exchange is a big one. I just don't know how much of it is?\nChristie Kelly: Yeah. The other adjustments was really related on the income statement to non-cash oriented translation loss of about $20 million.\nChris Lucas: Great. Thank you. That\u2019s all I have.\nChristie Kelly: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session. Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Sumit Roy for closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nEnd of Q&A:\nSumit Roy: Thanks Nick. Thank you all for joining us today. We're looking forward to ending 2022 strong and in seeing many of you at the NAREIT conference in two weeks. Good evening.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Christie Kelly",
            "content": "Thank you, Sumit. Put simply, it was another productive quarter for us. In the third quarter our business generated $0.98 per share of AFFO, representing 7.7% year-over-year growth. Our net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDAR was 5.3 times or 5.2 times giving effect to the annualization of net investment activity during the quarter. These ratios do not reflect the $1.3 billion in outstanding equity forwards we had at quarter end. As Sumit previously mentioned, we were both active and prudent in our capital-raising efforts since the end of the second quarter. In addition to raising over $2 billion during the quarter at an initial weighted average price of approximately $68 per share, subsequent to quarter end, we completed a $750 million bond transaction, the majority of which served as a synthetic euro offering to take advantage of favorable foreign exchange dynamics, while also allowing us to return to the US dollar public fixed income market, which we last accessed in 2020. In conjunction with this offering, we executed a US$600 million to euro 10-year cross-currency swap, resulting in the receipt of approximately $612 million in euro proceeds, an effective fixed rate euro-denominated semiannual yield to maturity of 4.7%. Additionally, giving effect to $500 million of interest rate hedges, which were terminated with the operated, we generated a $72 million cash settlement gain at pricing, which when amortized over the 10-year tenure of the note is expected to result in an effective semiannual yield to maturity of 3.93%. Financial flexibility has long been a hallmark of our strategy and our ability to move between various financing markets given our international capital needs is a competitive advantage. As previously reported in the third quarter, we upsized our US commercial paper program from $1 billion to $1.5 billion and established a euro commercial paper program with a capacity of $1.5 billion. The combined $3 billion commercial paper program, which is backstopped by our multicurrency $4.25 billion revolving credit facility, gives us the flexibility to efficiently match fund our short-term funding needs in various currencies at much lower rates than comparable US facility borrowings. As we look forward, we have limited near-term refinancing risk as only $23 million of mortgage debt comes due through the end of 2023 and our next unsecured debt maturity is not until 2024. With continued stable and consistent results in the quarter, we tightened our AFFO guidance range by $0.06 to $3.87 to $3.94, maintaining the midpoint at a 9% year-over-year growth rate, consistent with what we initially provided a year ago. As the monthly dividend company Realty Income's dividend will remain sacrosanct to our mission. This is a testament to our confidence in the time-tested consistency of our business model, supported by a conservative balance sheet and diverse real estate portfolio leased to clients that are leaders in their respective industries. In September, we increased the dividend for the 117th time and for the 100th consecutive quarter, representing a 5.1% increase compared to the dividend declared one year ago. We are proud of these accomplishments and the work our talented colleagues perform every day to help drive this consistent track record. Earlier this week, we celebrated the one-year anniversary of our VEREIT merger. We've grown together as one team over the last year and I'm pleased that we remain on track to realize over $50 million in run rate annual cost synergies that we estimated when we announced the merger. And with that, I would like to pass the call back to Sumit. I think Brad, you captured the headwinds together with the strengthening US dollar. I think in terms of where we see opportunity, is first as it relates to the determination on our AFFO per share, is the overall developments and as it relates to our clients that are on cash accounting. I just want to note that for Regal, we have no change associated with the status of Regal and in the midpoint of our guidance are expecting full collection. A couple of other things, is also just our access to the international borrowings, which are a nice tailwind and you can see that demonstrated in what we were able to do with the euro commercial paper program. And as Sumit articulated, our relationships with clients our ability to pivot in the marketplace, together with our strong pipeline and the timing of the Encore transaction, which could be a positive or a negative. Hope that helps, Brad. In terms of reserves Ron total reserves are $33 million. And just dovetailing with what Sumit said in regards to the watch list and what we've already made publicly available it's really primarily a story around Regal and the reserves that we have on the books associated with Regal. From the perspective of the reserves Linda, we took reserves on Regal as we had communicated of $23 million. And there, another $30 million of outstanding receivables associated with Regal to clarify. In terms of the total, we have for the watch list is $33 million, of which $23 million is Regal. And the remainder, as you would understand is primarily health and fitness. Escalators. Yeah. The other adjustments was really related on the income statement to non-cash oriented translation loss of about $20 million. You're welcome."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Sumit Roy",
            "content": "Thank you, Andrea. Welcome everyone. At Realty Income, we pride ourselves in having a consistent and dependable business model. For 53 years as an operating company, we have persevered through a variety of macroeconomic climates and our track record of stability notably during periods of volatility is particularly relevant during current times. We sit here today well positioned and operating very well across all areas of our business. We are grateful for all of our team members who make the success possible. To start off, we capitalized on opportunities to bolster our balance sheet in the third quarter, including raising over $2 billion of equity on the ATM with approximately $700 million of proceeds received during the third quarter as well as over $1.3 billion remaining subject to our settlement on a forward basis in alignment with our capital strategy. In addition, we issued $750 million of 10-year senior unsecured notes in October to further increase our liquidity. Between cash and cash equivalents, our availability under our credit facility, our liquidity as of the end of the third quarter was over $2.5 billion, which when combined with the $1.3 billion of our unsettled forward equity and approximately $744 million in net bond proceeds equates to liquidity of approximately $4.6 billion had the forwards and net bond proceeds being received at quarter end. Moving on to acquisitions. During the quarter, we acquired approximately $1.9 billion in high-quality real estate, bringing us to approximately $5.1 billion in acquisitions year-to-date. A significant portion of the properties purchased in Q3 were part of portfolio deals or large transactions. We believe these deals were accessible to us because of our size, scale, relationships, ability to close, access to and cost of capital together with our research and technology-driven analytic capabilities. For Realty Income, our competitive advantages allow us to design and execute on strategies that benefit all those we serve including our clients. The pending $1.7 billion Encore Boston Harbor transaction, which we continue to expect to close this year remains an example of this dynamic. Based on our current total portfolio annualized base rent, the transaction would comprise approximately 3% of our total portfolio annualized contractual rent, once closed. Further leveraging our international capabilities, we made our advent into Italy last week investing approximately \u20ac165 million in seven high-performing wholesale clubs, operated by Metro AG in major Italian cities like Rome and Florence. Metro is a pan-European leader in the wholesale club industry and operates almost 700 stores across Europe. Metro is publicly listed and investment-grade rated, and has continued to perform well during and since the pandemic. We are delighted to add them as a client and hope we will be able to add to this initial portfolio over time. During the third quarter, we did experience cap rate expansion registering a 6.1% cash cap rate on investments, which compares favorably to the 5.7% cap rate we realized our investments in the second quarter. This resulted in a third quarter investment spread, of 165 basis points based on actual capital raised, which is higher than our year-to-date total of 161 basis points and above our historical average. As we move towards year-end, we continue to see cap rates push higher as capital costs increase. This is consistent with the historical correlation we've come to expect, which has tended to preserve investment spreads as the market adjusts. Transaction flow remains strong with sourcing volume totaling approximately $18 billion this quarter, bringing year-to-date sourcing volume approximately $78 billion. We remain selective as we have acquired approximately 6.5% of sourced volume year-to-date. The international market continues to be an important part of our strategy and it remains an active component of our volume, representing approximately 33% of investment volume in the third quarter. Capital recycling continues to be a strong component of our funding strategy, which also has the dual purpose of culling noncore properties from the portfolio. During the third quarter, we sold 34 properties generating net sale proceeds of $142 million, at an unlevered IRR of 12.8% illustrating the full cycle attractiveness of owning net lease real estate under long-term leases.  We intend to continue to act opportunistically to dispose of assets at moments in time when we can obtain attractive risk-adjusted returns. In addition to the disposition of properties on our balance sheet, we also sold our interest in seven properties owned in an industrial JV that we assumed as part of our VEREIT merger. The gross purchase price totaled $905 million, at a low 4% cap rate. Our share of net sale proceeds was approximately $113.5 million. Our core portfolio continues to perform and by and large our clients have generally continued to perform very well despite the cyclical market changes and shifts in consumer behavior. A point to note, as previously publicly announced one of our clients Cineworld commenced Chapter 11 bankruptcy in September. Despite being one of its largest landlords, Cineworld represented only 1.5% of our total portfolio annualized base rent as of Q3. We'll continue working closely with Cineworld, as this process continues towards resolution. For some color regarding theaters, for the third quarter 2022, we collected approximately 85% of the contractual rent across our theater portfolio, as Cineworld Group plc was not yet required to pay rent for the month of September. For the month of October 2022, we have collected 100% of the contractual rent across our theater clients including Cineworld. For some specifics, our Cineworld portfolio consists of 41 properties, 17 of which are subject to a single master lease agreement and 22 of which have been accounted for under cash basis accounting since the third quarter of 2020. Through September, we have recognized $23.5 million of cumulative reserves on these properties, representing primarily contractual rent and expense recoveries that have not been collected, dating back to the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. These 22 properties on cash basis accounting currently account for approximately $1.6 million of monthly contractual base rent or 40% of our total exposure to Cineworld. Based on current public information and our internal analysis, we continue to believe our portfolio of Cineworld assets are generally comprised of the stronger performance in the operator's portfolio. Our locations are freestanding, single-tenant assets, typically with large land areas and close proximity to population centers, supporting potential conversion to residential, industrial or life science uses. We have received reverse inquiries from multifamily and industrial developers exploring opportunities on these sites. We believe there is alternative and adaptive reuse potential if Regal were to vacate any locations as part of bankruptcy. Moving on to some of the most important key operational metrics, delivering value that continue to demonstrate a consistent well-positioned real estate portfolio. At the end of the third quarter our occupancy was 98.9%. In Q3, we released 169 leases and achieved a rent recapture rate of 108.5%, bringing our year-to-date recapture rate to 106.7%. As we look forward, less than 4% of our contractual base rent comes due through the end of 2023, providing strong visibility into our near-term portfolio performance. At quarter end, approximately 43% of our portfolio's total annualized contractual rent was generated from investment-grade rated clients. Our properties leased to clients in our portfolio watch list represented less than 4% of our portfolio's annualized contractual rent. Lastly, our same-store rental revenue increased 1% during the quarter and 2.4% year-to-date and we continue to expect full year same-store growth to be approximately 2%. At this time I'll pass it over to Christie, who will further discuss results from the quarter. Thank you Christie. Our strengths have been accentuated in this quarter's result. While we cannot control the macroeconomic forces that periodically introduce volatility in the capital markets, I am regularly reminded that the resiliency of this team and the inherent stability of our business model allows us to look to the future with confidence. I'm pleased that we are able to lean in to market conditions when it's advantageous to serve our shareholders, and I believe that the best is still ahead of us. At this time, we can open it up for questions. Operator? It's more the former than the latter. We are definitely seeing movement in cap rates. If we were to compare it to what -- where the environment was at the beginning of the year, which is what I would say we saw over the last couple of years and compare it to cap rates that we are seeing today and what we experienced in the third quarter, I would say retail cap rates have moved circa 100 basis points. And it's a story of basically two ends of the credit spectrum. If you think about the high investment grade grocery assets those at the beginning of the year were trading in the low four cap rate range and those have moved the most. I would say today they are in the 5.5% maybe even in the 5.6% ZIP code. So that's about 150 basis points. And then on the other end of the spectrum, it was the higher yielding cap rates that had compressed quite a bit over the last few years that also saw similar movement. But the stuff that was in between has seen movements circa of 100 basis points and that's really what is starting to translate into actual realized cap rates that you noticed for the third quarter. Having said all of that, things don't happen at the spur of the moment. I mean, a lot of these transactions -- we started to have discussions with our potential clients about the movement that we were seeing in our cost of capital, which was quite brutal and quite immediate. And thanks to the relationships, thanks to our ability to close all of the things that I enumerated in my prepared remarks, some of the more institutional type clients were also experiencing similar dynamics and we're more than willing to adjust cap rates to continue to do business and continue to fund their respective businesses. And I think that's what you saw translating to the 40 basis points of increased cap rate that we were able to realize in the third quarter. But it is a timing thing. I just want to be very careful that depending on -- if for instance if the gaming asset in Boston, if that were to have closed in the third quarter that's already been sort of -- it's a transaction that's going to have a 5.9% cap rate that's going to sway the overall cap rate. So, it really is a question of when did those transactions get under contract and what is the timing of close that's going to dictate, what the quarter results are. But having said all of that, I think we are definitely seeing movement and it is in the quantum that I described earlier. It's a similar story on the industrial side. I would say, that industrial cap rates have also moved considerably and this is something that we started seeing even in the early part of the year. I think in my first quarter comments, I had talked about maybe seeing a 25 to 50 basis point movement. This was on the heels of Amazon announcing, that they are no longer going to be big takers of industrial assets. They accounted for about 20% of the volume, over the last few years. That started to see some movement -- that resulted in some movement on the industrial side. And then that movement continued through the second quarter. And I'll say today, despite what we quoted in our joint venture that we sold in the low 4s, I would say, similar assets that we were pursuing are in the 5.5 ZIP code today. So, there's clearly movement. And the hope is that the movement will continue in the right direction, over the next coming months. And our portfolio is a testament -- our portfolio, as well as our pipeline is a testament to that. Yes. So, the spread we were able to achieve third quarter year-to-date was right around 161 basis points and this is based on actual capital raised throughout the year. And for the quarter, it was closer to 165 basis points. And one of the things I'll point to is that in our investor deck, I believe it's Page 26, we do lay out precisely how we calculate our cost of capital. And there are basically three components to it, one of which is the free cash flow that we are generating. -- as well as the cost of equity loaded for the cost of raising that equity and our bond prices. But there was a strange thing that played out in the third quarter, and I don't know if I've got this fact 100% right, but we reached a 52-week high as well as our 52-week low during the third quarter. That was the level of volatility that we experienced, and we will call it luck, call it Jonathan Pong doing his thing, -- we were able to raise a lot of our equity capital on a forward basis with an average price of $68, and that's $2 billion worth of equity 700 of which we obviously was able to -- we were able to close and settle at the end of the third quarter and $1.3 billion of which we will settle at the end of the fourth quarter. And so that's the reason why I want to be very precise around the actual realized spread versus what traditionally has been a calculation of average WACC over a given period. This is the first quarter where we felt like there was a massive diversion precisely driven by the volatility that I just spoke about. But yes, that's how we calculate our WACC. Yes. R.J., it's going to be a function of how quickly the cap rates adjust. Clearly, there are mechanisms available to us on the capital side on the financing side that we are going to avail of -- but that's limited in terms of what is the ultimate spread that we can realize. And we are being incredibly disciplined around making sure that the team is pivoting to hurdle rates that we need to achieve on the cap rate side in order to continue to maintain spreads that we feel like represents the right spread for the kind of risk that we are taking based on the acquisitions that we are pursuing. And I think I mentioned this in the second quarter, but I'll say it again, I have been pleasantly surprised with how quickly cap rates have moved. And again, based on some of the transactions that we are seeing in our pipeline, we are very optimistic that we'll be able to continue to maintain the spreads that we have historically maintained -- and we see that over the continuing next few quarters. But timing will be of the essence. Like I said, if there are certain transactions that we entered into, especially on the development side, that was 12 months ago, those are going to not be quite as accretive as transactions that we are entering into today, which will potentially close in the fourth quarter and some of which will close in the first quarter that have spreads that are more in line with what our historical spreads have been. So timing is going to be of the essence in terms of what we report at the end of a given quarter. Thank you, R.J. Yes. It's a good question Greg. And it goes back to having sticky sellers. Sellers who haven't quite embraced the changing cost of capital environment, who are hoping for this to have a shorter duration disruption and starting to recognize that given what the Fed is doing, given what they're seeing on the inflation side that this may be a longer process than what they had anticipated. I think that is part of the reason why you saw a tailing off on the sourcing side. We were averaging around $30 billion per quarter. Third quarter I would still claim was quite robust with $18 billion worth of sourcing, one-third of which was from the international market. And so on a relative basis, yes, there was a bit of a slowing down and it's largely being driven by the time it takes for sellers to adjust to the new environment. And there too it really is a story of those that are institutional sellers they are able to adjust to it a lot quicker than some of the non-institutional more private owners of real estate for whom it has taken and will take a little bit more time to adjust. Yes. I think, the way I'll answer that question is to say in large portfolio deals, which tend to be owned by institutional owners they're far more receptive to the changing cap rate environment and far more accepting of the changing cap rate environment. And so it will come as no surprise to you that over 70% of what we did were portfolio deals in the third quarter. It should also come as no surprise to you that some of the institutional owners of real estate were far more willing to enter into sale leaseback as an alternative source of raising capital, especially, given their traditional sources of capital which may have been the leverage finance market or the high-yield market and the disruption that they saw there. And so about 50% of what we did in the third quarter were largely -- were sale-leaseback transactions. And so I think that will give you a flavor for some of the transactions that we did. It was still mostly I want to say 94% was retail and there was about 4%, 4.5% of industrial assets that we did, but largely driven by what we are seeing on the retail side. Sure. I'll tell you Michael I mean we were doing north of 50% in the international markets in the first quarter. We did north of 50% in the second quarter. We are at one-third of the total volume in the third quarter. Again, it really is a function of the timing of close et cetera. Having said that, I will say that the sellers in the US are far more accepting of the changing financing environment than perhaps in Europe. And Europe is by country. It's a smaller market. And so it does take a little bit longer for things to adjust. Having said all of that, we are finding very good opportunities in the UK. And now with the advent into Italy I believe that momentum will continue. Because for precisely some of the reasons that I think we touched on during the second quarter, the debt markets are very unsettled. It has a very high cost associated with it. And that's driving some of the transactions actually on both sides of the pond. But one of the additional dynamics that we are seeing play out in Europe is some of the pressures that some of the funds are feeling. And in order for them to raise the appropriate level of capital, monetizing real estate is creating opportunities for us. And so I wouldn't read too much into it. There is still a very, very healthy pipeline that we have within Realty Income. And the sourcing volumes continue to be yes, lower than what we saw in the first half but still very healthy. Sure, Michael. Look I mean anytime you have consolidation the question needs to be asked who is doing the consolidation? If Kroger is going out there and this is a publicly announced transaction with regards to Albertsons, Kroger is still BBB rated. S&P reaffirmed the rating, although they did put it on a negative outlook. And they're acquiring Albertsons, which is a BB-rated credit still solid rated. But I don't necessarily see that as a bad thing. Now there are obviously a lot of other social issues that we have to also address and take into consideration. But from a pure credit standpoint it's actually -- it's a stronger outcome for us that suddenly 30 basis points that we have of Albertsons that has a BB credit associated with it, is now going to get enhanced to a BBB rating. So from a purely a credit perspective, that's not necessarily a bad outcome for us, but that obviously doesn't address a lot of other issues that should be addressed. And I think is percolating through the markets today, around the viability of this combination. But by and large there isn't a standard answer that all consolidation is good. It really does depend on the specific situations. Thank you. So Wes, there isn't one single answer that can address the master lease question. It is very much jurisdictionally dependent, depending on where the bankruptcy is playing out. And in this case, I think, I believe, it's in Texas. It's a function of how they're going to interpret the strength of the master lease. But yes, having a master lease certainly does accrue certain benefits to us. And it should be viewed as an all or nothing situation. But we can't guarantee that going forward. We'll see how it all plays out. With regards to Regal and the ultimate outcome, you read a fair amount of optimism into some of our prepared remarks and when we have answered questions directly. That is a true read. I'm not saying that, Regal will continue to run 41 assets when they emerge from Chapter 11 but what I am telling you is the ultimate economic outcome, on this portfolio, we feel very comfortable about. And a lot of it has largely been driven by unsolicited inbounds that we have been receiving, even on some of the assets that we recognized to be not very good performers and recognizing that the best use for these assets perhaps may not be a theater asset going forward but something totally different. And when you start to look at where these are located the amount of land in some cases north of 10 acres creating a mixed use or a multifamily makes it tremendous amounts. And value creation opportunities for us to partner with some of these developers can create a lot of value for us. Yes, it's going to take time, but we feel fairly optimistic that the ultimate economic outcome on this portfolio will be one that we will be very comfortable with. Thank you. Yes, I'll take the question around do we have more than 50 basis points -- 50 basis points for any other clients outside of Regal and the answer is no, we don't. Our total watch list is less than 4%. It's actually 3.9%. And we don't have any large clients on this watch list outside of Regal. Regal is the largest one. We do have some other clients on this in the health and fitness industry et cetera. But again from an overall perspective we feel pretty good about it. In terms of -- I'll have Christie answer the other part of your question. Ron I don't want to overstate the environment. You just need one other competitor to come in and undercut what the normal situation would dictate in terms of cap rates to continue to keep a lid on cap rates. Having said all of that, if you look at the trend lines, there is no doubt that cap rates are moving and they're moving much faster than -- and I've said this before -- than what I expected. It is also true that clients with whom we have relationships, we've been able to enter into contracts with them, where we've asked even from where we first started, and didn't have a contract to when they came back and reengaged with us and said, look, the cost of capital environment has changed for us. This is what we'll be able to do. They're still chosen to work with us, exclusively, and these tend to be larger transactions. So, there is no doubt that having fewer competitors out there, who have the cost of capital to be able to transact that spreads that would be acceptable to their investors, creates an opportunity for us. And this is a relative gain. We have been able to move cap rates, but I think it would be overstating, if I were to tell you that everything that happens going forward, we are going to be the beneficiary of. That's not the case. But we will do better than our share. I think that, Ron you can take away from what I'm saying. Thank you. Yeah. Harsh, that's a very difficult question. But if you are forcing me to answer that question, I would say, anywhere in the region of 20 to 30 basis points, 35 basis points. And if that \u2013 if the transaction size continues to be bigger and bigger, you're going to start going beyond that is how you should think about it. There is a dearth in this particular environment of potential buyers being able to write large checks, and that is our single biggest advantage today, along with the fact that obviously on a relative basis our cost of capital has held up. But it is going to be very much asset-by-asset, portfolio-by-portfolio discussion in terms of what is that delta between the one-off market and the portfolio market. In terms of how long is it going to take, I'll tell you that, a Chick-fil-A \u2013 15 year Chick-fil-A will still trade in the force today. There is enough buyers \u2013 private buyers who can write a check for $5 million or $4 million who don't necessarily need to rely on the debt markets in order to do so. And so it's a tough question to answer in terms of how quickly the one-off market is going to adjust. There will be an adjustment, there's no doubt because even a lot of the private buyers would lean on the debt markets to finance some of their asset purchase. But it's tough for me to \u2013 I mean, I saw this Chick-fil-A example literally a week ago, and I asked the team what is the ask and what do you think it's going to trade at. And the answer was mid-4s. And so how long will it take for that to adjust? Who knows? The good news here is it helps us on the disposition side. And if we have one-off assets that we feel like we can take advantage of this market we'll certainly do so. It's not a big part of our business. But like I said more than 70% of what we buy are portfolio deals. And so there I think we are getting the kind of differential that it warrants. And so we continue to focus on that side of the business. Well, certainly part of that swap was to help finance, the transactions that we have in Europe including the one that we did with Metro. Look that's a fantastic transaction. We started having conversations around this transaction if I want to -- maybe at the beginning of this year perhaps even late last year. And it's a very interesting geography Italy is. It's the fourth largest GDP in Europe. It is one that we feel like, we can find these types of transactions with investment-grade rated or highly rated operators executing very good businesses, who are looking for real estate partners. And that's the reason why we find Italy to be very fascinating. And we haven't disclosed the cap rates. But suffice it to say it was a very healthy cap rate. And even in this environment is allowing us to capture spreads that are very acceptable to us. The point about Europe that I want you to take away is not so much that cap rates taking longer to adjust. It is adjusting. It will take longer. But to your point I think the pain in Europe is going to be a lot longer than the pain that we are planning on experiencing here in the US. And therefore it will create opportunities. And we want to be front in line to take advantage of those opportunities. And I think under Neil's tutelage, the team is very comfortable continuing to cultivate the relationships that they have established and -- in some of the areas that we would like to grow our business. That work is already being is already underway. And so this is going to continue to be a very important area of growth for our business. And I want to remind you Harsh, when you think about when we first went into the UK, this was in 2019, retail was not in favor. Brexit has dominated the conversation and we were able to do deals that subsequent to us having done those deals, cap rates compressed to the tune of 70 basis points 80 basis points perhaps even more. And so we are going to be opportunistic. We are going to position ourselves and use our inherent competitive advantages to execute transactions where it makes sense. But yes, we will be very diligent and very selective. But we didn't enter Europe to shy away when things got rough. We believe the exact opposite that, it's going to be at times like this and what we believe will happen in Europe over the next 12 months that will create opportunities for us. Thank you. Yes. Linda, I think it's a testament to the team. It's a testament to us controlling more assets for given operators. There is certainly, a drop of -- switching costs have gotten much higher for a lot of our clients. One of the things that we would compete with is the ability for our clients to basically say, I'm going to go and build the new asset down the road. And that's going to be a better outcome. But now, given the inflationary environment, given the construction costs, the switching cost hurdles have certainly crept up. And the fact that we do have 11,700 assets, we tend to control a lot more of the assets for a given client. And so, not talking about leverage, but we can have a much more holistic conversation with clients that not only take into account near-term resolutions but mid-term resolutions as well and come up with a win-win situation and therefore, be able to get the kind of re-leasing spreads that we have. Having said all of that, it is quite -- I'm very happy that we were able to do 108%, but it is -- I don't want to view it as an outlier. But if you look at the history of the company since we've been reporting this, we've basically been right around 100%, 101% net of re-leasing spreads. So this on a proportionate basis is certainly higher, and I think it's a testament to the environment we find ourselves. I think near term, you can expect us to continue to be in this particular ZIP code. The one thing that I will say that we are looking into is, especially in an environment like this, we will be a little bit more receptive to looking at clients. And, look, this is an analysis that we do across the portfolio, what is the best economic outcome. Renewing with an existing client based on the 5% increase, engaging with an existing client that is asking for a 10% reduction from where it's closing and then looking at the alternative of selling the assets and putting the proceeds to use in the current cap rate environment. Once we go through that decision tree and let's also throw in repositioning of the asset as a fourth variable, we decide what is the most favorable outcome. And so far, the outcome that -- for the last few years has been resulting in north of 103%, 104%, 105% of re-leasing spreads, but it is possible that it might revert back to 100% or 101%, because it is more favorable for us to keep an existing client, while taking a bit of a haircut. But over the next six to eight months, I still believe that we'll be north of 100% in terms of recapture rate. Sure. Yes. Nick, if you can point to candidates who'd be willing to engage in conversations around M&A today, this can be a very interesting time to discuss that. But I suspect that a lot of the management team, Nick, would be very focused on trying to run their business trying to make sure that they emerge from this particular economic environment stronger, so that they can engage in M&A transactions. But theoretically speaking, M&A is something that one should absolutely consider, especially if it's a 100% stock deal and you don't have an over-reliance on the public markets on the debt side to help finance. And if your relative cost of capital is stronger, which in our case, under most circumstances, it is, and that is something that would be very attractive to us. It's just -- it'll be difficult and I'm just -- it's a hypothetical comment I'm making. It'd be difficult to see management teams of potential companies wanting to engage in that sort of discussion in this environment. Yes. You tell me, Nick. You cover all the gaming companies. And what I'm seeing is that, they've all gotten repriced. And I don't know if we did them the favor or what, but they're trading at levels that I don't know if there'll be a lot of movement from, where we entered into the win -- the Encore Boston Harbor asset. But, look, I still think that that is a wonderful asset. We underwrote it about a year ago now -- well, not quite, almost a year ago with a profile of about $210 million in EBITDA and it is already performing at a $250 million EBITDA and I still don't believe that it has fully stabilized, especially with gaming -- sports betting sorry being legalized. So I don't know if I would say to you Nick that that five nine would be dramatically different today, but we haven't seen an asset like that yet. So difficult for me to opine on that. We are hopeful and that's one of the things that we talked about on the earnings guidance. We are expecting to close in the fourth quarter. That remains our conviction. But really as to when in the fourth quarter remains a bit of a question mark, but we still believe that it will close in the fourth quarter. And I have a very high conviction on that front. Thank you. Hi, John. Yes, we have. It's still difficult here in the US to get untethered or uncapped CPIs, especially given the environment that we are in and retail tends to be a low-margin business, but there is far more receptivity to getting higher interest rate -- higher -- what do... Escalators. Thank you. Higher escalators in our leases today than it was perhaps 12 months ago. The same discussion on escalators in Europe, it is a lot more easier for us to engage and get CPI-type adjustments. And in fact, the Metro transaction that we talked about has CPI escalators built into the lease. And so I think those are easier in Europe than it is here, but we are starting to see the seller being more willing to give us higher escalators than what we have traditionally seen in this space. Yeah. John. Again, it's going to be a function of the type of retail. The higher-yielding stuff is going to tend to have higher elevation, higher escalators. The investment-grade guys -- it's still going to be tough. Maybe they'll be willing to give you fixed bumps every five years, which perhaps they wouldn't have 12 months ago. But I mean it's difficult for me to quantify the exact amount of increase in this environment. What I can tell you is we are seeing increases. Thanks, John. That is it Chris. It really is waiting on the regulators to give us a thumbs up. And once we have that, then we'll be in a position to close."

I mean, these are all very liquid currencies that we're looking to hedge going out very short-term. And so from that dynamic, yes, it's difficult to understand where these rates might be going but the mechanism itself nothing has really changed. On the hedging front, I would say that when you look out the next 12 months we are around 50% hedged at this point on earnings. And we aspire to get to our hedging program where hopefully going forward rates aren't the story -- FX rates aren't the story of any quarterly earnings. So rest assured we're very mindful of that."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon and good morning, and welcome to the Realty Income Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrea Behr, Manager of Corporate Communications. Please go ahead.\nAndrea Behr: Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income second quarter operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Christie Kelly, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. Also joining us on our call is Jonathan Pong, Senior Vice President-Corporate Finance, together with our One Team leaders. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that maybe considered forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The Company\u2019s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the Company\u2019s Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you would like to ask additional questions, you may reenter the queue. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy.\nSumit Roy: Thank you, Andrea. Welcome everyone. Cultivating strong and enduring relationships with all our stakeholders is foundational to the success of our business. And I'd like to thank everyone listening for your continued support. Additionally, I would like to express my appreciation to all my Realty Income colleagues who continue make significant contributions towards our growth initiatives, while serving our clients and all stakeholders as one Realty Income team. We are pleased with the momentum across all areas of our business amidst an uncertain macro environment, which we believe once again, demonstrates the stability of our business model and its ability to thrive irrespective of the economic cycle. The strength of our global investment pipeline has allowed us to invest over $3.2 billion in high-quality real estate in the first half of the year, including approximately $1.7 billion during the second quarter. Given this momentum, we are increasing our 2022 acquisitions guidance to over $6 billion. On the topic of acquisitions, I'd like to mention two key developments that we are observing in the marketplace. First, as demonstrated by the weighted average 5.7% cash cap rate, we were able to achieve on our investments in the second quarter, cap rates are moving higher in our target markets. Our second quarter cap rate ticked higher compared to the 5.6% and 5.4% cap rates we achieved in the previous two quarters. The positive correlation between cap rates and interest rate is also evident in our acquisition pipeline. Second, as a corollary to rising debt and equity costs that have impacted much of our competition, the pipeline of acquisition opportunities materializing for us at accretive spreads continues to grow. As a reminder, we report our cap rates on a cash basis. On a straight line basis, we estimate our second quarter cap rate to be approximately 6.2%. And generally, the difference between cash and straight line cap rates ranges between 50 and 70 basis points in any given period. Transaction flow remains strong with sourcing volume totaling approximately $26 billion in this quarter, bringing year-to-date sourcing volume to approximately $60 billion. We remain selective as we have acquired approximately 5% of sourced volume year-to-date. During the second quarter as percentage of revenue, approximately 39% of acquisition volume was leased to investment-grade rated clients. We remain committed to our underwriting principles of partnering with well capitalized clients who are leaders in their respective industries. Our international investment volume continues to comprise a significant percentage of our total volume, representing 41% of global volume in the second quarter at a cash cap rate of approximately 5.8%. We are encouraged that our size, scale and access to well-priced capital provides us with the platform and currency to actively deploy capital as we build continued momentum heading into 2023. It was also an active quarter with regard to dispositions. We sold 70 properties, generating net sale proceeds of $150 million at an unlevered IRR of approximately 9.3%. Year-to-date, we have sold 104 properties with net sales proceeds totaling $272 million, generating an unlevered IRR of approximately 9.4%. Capital recycling continues to be a value accretive activity for us. And importantly, the unlevered returns we have been able to deliver speak to the attractive risk adjusted investment profile of our properties that have gone through our full investment cycle. Our diligent underwriting process, exposure to high-quality credit clients and the inherent quality of our real estate continue to deliver consistent performance. At the end of the second quarter, our occupancy was 98.9%, the highest occupancy rate we have achieved in over 10 years. Based on our current occupancy rates and client profile, we are increasing our year-end 2022 occupancy guidance to over 98%. During the second quarter, we re-leased 193 leases and achieved a rent recapture rate of 105.6%, bringing our year-to-date recapture rate to 105.9%. At quarter-end, 43.2% of our portfolios annualized contractual rent was generated from investment-grade rated clients. Further, our properties leased to clients on our portfolio watch list represents less than 4% of our portfolios analyze contractual rent, which is largely consistent with the low percentages we have seen so far this year. Finally, our same-store rental revenue increased 2% during the quarter and 3% year-to-date. With a continued strong operations performance of our portfolio, we are increasing our guidance for same-store rent growth to approximately 2% for 2022. At this time, I'll pass it over to Christie, who will further discuss results from the quarter.\nChristie Kelly: Thank you, Sumit. During the second quarter, our business generated $0.97 of AFFO per share, representing 10.2% year-over-year growth. The growth engine of our Company revolves around accretive acquisitions. Our investment goals are supported by our well-capitalized balance sheet and favorable cost of capital, which remain competitive advantages for us in the net lease industry. We finished the quarter well within our target leverage ratios with net debt-to-annualized adjusted EBITDAR of 5.3 times or 5.2 times on a pro forma basis, giving annualized effects to net investment activity during the quarter. It was another active quarter for us on the capital raising front. As we issued approximately $1.8 billion of long-term and permanent capital, including nearly $1.1 billion of equity through our ATM program and a \u00a3600 million private placement note offering which priced at a weighted average fixed interest rate of 3.22% with a blended tenure of 10.5 years. As a result, we finished the quarter with approximately $1 billion of commercial paper and revolver borrowings net of cash. Our outstanding CPE and revolver borrowings essentially represent our only variable rate debt exposure across a total debt principal balance of almost $16 billion. As Sumit mentioned previously, our ability to access well-priced capital is a competitive advantage and we took steps during the quarter to further bolster this capacity. As previously announced in April this year, we recasted and upsized our multicurrency revolving credit facility from $3 billion to $4.25 billion. Subsequent to quarter-end, we upsized our U.S. Commercial Paper Program from $1 billion to $1.5 billion and established our Euro Commercial Paper Program with a capacity of $1.5 billion. The combined $3 billion Commercial Paper Programs for which our revolving credit facility serves as a liquidity backstop will give us the flexibility to efficiently finance our short-term funding needs at materially lower rates than comparable facility borrowings. Given the momentum we continue to see in our investment activities in Europe, the establishment of a Euro program was a strategic goal of ours this year. And it will serve as an efficient tool for us to take advantage of the comparably lower all-in commercial paper rates in the Euro market. With the health of our portfolio and investment progress achieved year-to-date, balanced alongside the timing of capital deployment and continued capital markets volatility, we affirm our previously announced 2022 AFFO per share guidance of $3.84 to $3.97, representing nearly 9% annual growth at the mid-point. From a dividend perspective as the monthly dividend company, consistent quarterly increases in dividend reflects the confidence we have in the cash flow generated capacity of our business. In June, we increased our dividend for the 116th time in our company\u2019s history. And last month, we declared our 625th consecutive common stock monthly dividend. From a sustainability perspective, further in June, we published our green bond allocation report, and I\u2019m pleased to report that the net proceeds from our inaugural green bond offering have been fully allocated to eligible green projects in accordance with the criteria outlined in our green financing framework. From a merger perspective lastly, I am pleased to report that we have completed the integration of our VEREIT merger, which culminated in the conversion to a single ERP system for the combined entities during the second quarter. This could not have been accomplished so seamlessly without the commitment and dedication of our talented one team. And finally, we remain on track to achieve the expected $45 million to $55 million of annualized run rate cost energies we initially shared over a year ago when we announced the merger. And now, I would like to pass the call back to Sumit.\nSumit Roy: Thank you, Christie. Coming off a record 2021 from an investment standpoint, I\u2019m proud that our team has only accelerated the momentum this year. Most importantly, we believe the future is bright as our positioning to further gain market share in the investment arena grows. Indeed, the advantages afforded to us given our size scale and access to well priced capital have rarely been more pronounced than they are today. And we look forward to continuing to capitalize on this in the days ahead. At this time, we can open it up for questions. Operator?\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please go ahead.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question.\nChristie Kelly: Hi, Michael.\nMichael Goldsmith: Hello, good. Thank you for taking my question. First question is on cap rates moving higher, the markets getting a little bit better. You have a larger acquisition team due to the VEREIT merger. How can you be a little bit more aggressive or take advantage of the improving markets, just given that combined with there are some uncertainties in kind of the borrowing markets as well.\nSumit Roy: That\u2019s a good question, Michael, because there are competing variables in this market today. You\u2019re absolutely right. That cap rates are moving in the right direction. There are adjusting a lot quicker than I had originally anticipated. We do have a much bigger team. And with the VEREIT merger, some of the team members that we have inherited, they are definitely producing and focusing on a certain area of the high real market that is actually resulting in transactions for us. The offset to that, however, is the capital market. Look, on a relative basis, we are doing very well. If you look at our tenure unsecured bond spreads, they have moved, I would say approximately 85 basis points. You look at our peers, our net lease peers with a BBB rating, it\u2019s moved 120 basis points to 150 basis points. If you look at our cost of equity, it is essentially unchanged from the beginning of the year. But if you look at our net lease peers, they\u2019ve dropped by about 1.8 times. So those are the positive momentums, but it is true also that our cost of capital overall has also increased. And the question really is around, can we generate the right spreads to move the needle on the overall AFFO per share growth? And the answer is yes. But as you know, there is an adjustment period, which is why we have increased our acquisition guidance to over $6 billion from over $5 billion as a testament to what we are seeing in terms of benefits accruing to us, based on some of what I just discussed. We are starting to see a lot more transactions coming back to us those that we were not willing to price at the levels that the sellers were expecting when they initially brought it to us, are now coming back with an adjusted cap rate, which works. It is also true that the overall team has been able to just source more and those are sort of shown in the sourcing volumes that, that we have shared with you of $60 billion year-to-date. But with interest rate movements and more importantly, the velocity at which these interest rates have moved, the spreads continue to be right around at 110 basis points, 111 basis points year-to-date, which is slightly below our overall average. So that\u2019s the reason why that this positive momentum is being reflected in higher acquisition volume, but not necessarily translating into higher earnings guidance.\nMichael Goldsmith: Very helpful. And then as a follow-up, European acquisitions were about 40% this quarter. And so that represents a bit of an acceleration from what we\u2019ve seen. So is 40% kind of the right mix for next year or at least the second half into next year like how are you thinking about the U.S. versus Europe mix going forward?\nSumit Roy: Yes. Michael, it fluctuates. I mean there have been quarters actually where the international acquisition number has been not the 50% of the overall volume. And as we start to grow into newer markets, et cetera, obviously, the total addressable market continues to increase for us. And as we become much more mature in each one of these newer markets, the sourced volume as well as which translates to closed volume will increase. But I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to say that, at this point in time, we should be thinking anything north of this 40% number 41% is what we achieved in the second quarter, as being it should be the guiding composition of the overall acquisition numbers going forward. There will be quarters where we\u2019ll do more just like we\u2019ve done in the past, but 40% seems to be the right number.\nMichael Goldsmith: Thank you very much.\nSumit Roy: Thank you, Mike.\nOperator: The next question is from Nick Joseph with Citi. Please go ahead.\nChristie Kelly: Hi, Nick.\nNick Joseph: Thank you. Hi, how are you? You touched on cap rates obviously expanding a bit. Wondering if you could break that out between international versus the U.S. where you\u2019ve seen more expansion, where you\u2019ve seen more stickiness or any differences between the two.\nSumit Roy: Sure. That\u2019s a great question, Nick, and welcome back to our space. I would say that the movement in cap rates here in the U.S. are certainly much more pronounced than what we have seen in the international markets. And it is largely a function of the Fed being a lot more aggressive than the ECB or the Bank of England have been. Having said that, we just saw an announcement earlier today that the Bank of England has moved its interest rates 50 basis points. So we do see that translating to higher cap rates in the UK as well as in the rest of Continental Europe. So just to quantify some of these movements, I would say that depending on the product, and when I say retail, you can go from groceries, which have moved the most because they had become the most aggressive, they\u2019ve moved up about a 100 basis points to some of the other industries that we focus on within the retail space, I would quantify that movement is being right around 25 basis points to 50 basis points. And you should start to see that being reflected in the subsequent quarters and the acquisition cap rates \u2013 cash cap rates that we are going to share with the market going forward. In the \u2013 in Europe, we have also seen movement, but it hasn\u2019t been quite as pronounced maybe 5 basis points to 10 basis points. On the industrial side, the movement has been a bit more visible 25 basis points to 50 basis points, similar to what we experienced here in the U.S. But I would say the industrial market has continued to see an expansion on cap rates. And I would say, from beginning to end, maybe you circa 50 basis points of movement on average. Now, obviously, there are certain markets where the movement has been a lot, lot less than that Inland Empire comes to mind. But the more secondary tertiary markets, you have seen a more pronounced movement than it could be even north of 50 to 75 basis.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. That's very helpful. And then you mentioned deals coming back, do those fall out of contract, did they \u2013 did the seller just not get the pricing? What are you see broadly as those \u2013 as you get a second crack at some of them?\nSumit Roy: Yes. It's largely buyers that rely on the debt capital markets either the CMBS market or the bank loan market. You are in New York, you know what the money market, the big banks, the BofAs, the JPMorgans, the Wells, I'm not going to say that they have a moratorium on new loans, but it is much more difficult for them to create new bank debt or increased revolvers, et cetera, for more distress credit. So the overall debt market has sort of become a lot more expensive for some of these levered buyers. And that's what we've seen is that they're no longer being able to honor the original cap rates that transactions were being struck at. And of course, we chose not to pursue those transactions at those given pricing. And so when they do come back to us and as long as we like the transaction, it was just a pricing discussion. We are being able to now, either honor the cap rate that we had or even expand out those cap rates to reflect current market conditions. But the fact that the surety of close has become so much more important for the sellers today is clearly prevalent in a lot of the discussions that we are having with the sellers today.\nNick Joseph: Thank you.\nSumit Roy: Sure.\nOperator: The next question is from Connor Siversky with Berenberg. Please go ahead.\nChristie Kelly: Hi, Connor.\nConnor Siversky: Thanks for having me on the call. I'm curious on this cap rate discussion, and I'm appreciate your comments that you have a correlation between rising rates and subsequent impact on cap rates. But I'm wondering if you've ever been able to establish what the lag looks like. For example, with a 25 basis point increase in rates, how long does it take for that to reflect in cap rates? And then second to that, are you seeing that relationship accelerate, given that you are seeing some of these lending partners shut down their operations?\nSumit Roy: Yes, it's a great question. And unfortunately, if we were in a lab where we could control all variables that sort of drive this correlation, it would be a lot easier of an answer to give you. Historically, when we've done these correlations, we have found that the lag to be anywhere between nine to perhaps even as long as 12 months. I was a lot more skeptical coming into this particular situation coming into this year and seeing the rising interest rate environment. Just because of the \u2013 the sheer volume of capital that has come into our space on the institutional side. And I was a bit hesitant to continue to say, hey, it's going to be this nine to 12 month lag before cap rates start to reflect the new environment, because of this wealth of capital. However, what I didn't take into account was the debt markets adjusting as quickly as they did. And even this new capital that has come into our space, both on the private equity side, as well as on the public side of the equation. The debt markets adjusted a lot faster. And therefore the pullback from these newer buyers in our space has been a lot more acute, which has resulted in cap rates adjusting a lot faster. I mean, we've had a rising interest rate environment now for the last six months. And we are already starting to see cap rates adjust 25 to 50 basis points. And like I said, in the grocery sector, we saw sale leasebacks being done in the low fours that are now coming back and being done in the low fives to mid fives. So it's not a constant Connor that I can point to. It is a reflection of the environment that you're faced with, but it's a good thing for us truth be told that cap rates can adjust, as quickly as they have in a rising interest rate environment. I just hope that the corollary is not true.\nConnor Siversky: Got it. That's a very interesting color. I'll leave it there. Thank you.\nSumit Roy: Thanks.\nOperator: The next question is from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nChristie Kelly: Hi, Haendel.\nHaendel St. Juste: Hey, there. Hello, everyone. So I guess, I'm curious on your assessment of the non-high grade portion of the market right now. Curious, I understand, it's not a focus of yours, but you do dabble and do have exposure there. Curious, of the relative attractiveness of high grade versus perhaps non-high grade and if there was a scenario perhaps enough premium of a return to perhaps make you do a bit more on the non-high grade side. Thanks.\nSumit Roy: Hi, Haendel. Yes. This is a narrative that continues to be out there that we are not focused or that we are disproportionately focused on the high grade side of the equation. Just look at what we did this quarter. I mean, 62% of what we did was sub-investment grade or non-rated. So it is \u2013 I don't believe true to say that all we focus on is investment grade credit and that particular product. What we have tried to share with the market clearly unsuccessfully. So that we focus on risk adjusted returns that are points in time where the risk adjusted returns on investment grade credit is far superior to what we were seeing on the non-investment grade side. And we pivot there and we try to do those transactions. And then there are other times where the exact opposite is true, where sub-investment grade is allowing you to capture risk adjusted returns that are far superior. And so we find ourselves in that period today, where we are finding very good opportunities on the non-investment grade side of the equation, and as such are being able to get a lot of those transactions over the finish line, i.e., 62% in the second quarter. So we are indifferent to the credit ratings. What we focus on is looking at the totality of that particular opportunity to then ascribe a return profile that makes sense for the risk that we are undertaking. And that will continue to vary. We don't target investment grade. Investment grade tends to be a byproduct of the underwriting. So hopefully that clarifies the question you asked.\nHaendel St. Juste: Sure, sure. Certainly appreciate the color, the perspective. Any update with Encore still on track to close I believe in fourth quarter, how's the regulatory and licensing coming along.\nSumit Roy: Still on track, we are quite optimistic. We've continued to stay very close to the MGC. We are working very closely with them, so we are very optimistic that it'll close by the end of this year in the fourth quarter.\nHaendel St. Juste: Thank you.\nSumit Roy: Sure.\nOperator: The next question is from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nChristie Kelly: Hey, Brad.\nBrad Heffern: Hey, everyone. Hi, Christie. One for you, I guess. On the new guidance, can you just talk about the moving pieces that kept the AFFO per share number unchanged despite the higher acquisition total? I assume it said potentially tighter spreads versus the cost of capital, but I'm curious if there was a FX impact or a interest expense impact or anything else.\nChristie Kelly: Yes. I think, Brad, just to start off Sumit \u2013 Sumit had started to touch on this in terms of some of the moving pieces given the fact that we had increase our acquisition volume to over $6 billion, but kept as you observed in our AFFO per share guidance the same and reaffirmed it. And there are some factors there in terms of first, the volatility in the capital markets as we've discussed, the overall rate hikes and the magnitude of those hikes and any future actions that may be taken. Both in terms of the European and U.S. environments. We also to the point that you were making. We do actually hedge from the perspective of FX to protect our international income as well as we\u2019ve got hedges in place to lower our effective interest rates, and we\u2019ll touch on that a bit more in a second. But the other thing too is that just the general timing of the investment volume, the team has just been doing a great job. We\u2019ve got really strong momentum as Sumit discussed in the market. And the acquisitions that we close from now towards the end of the year, while our attractive are really going to be setting us up nicely for 2023. So the timing of that isn\u2019t as beneficial for the year in AFFO as it will be for the full year impact next year. And I think, to the upside, we still have some clients on cash accounting, that have just started under their deferral arrangements. And so we\u2019ll be monitoring them for continued consistent payment performance, and make the appropriate calls and alignment with our policy and guidelines when we may be taking them off of cash accounting. But I\u2019d love to turn it over to Jonathan to talk a little bit more specifically about hedging and the impact.\nJonathan Pong: Thanks, Christie. Yes, Brad, you\u2019ve seen us obviously issue a lot of local currency debt in the sterling market that\u2019s intentional, obviously, much lower haul in rates there. But certainly, from a natural hedge perspective, having interest expense denominated in the same currency where we\u2019re now getting rent limits the exposure that we have in volatility. And then we have a cleanup methodology where we hedge a portion of AFFO that is unhedged. And so from that dynamic, we feel like we\u2019ve mitigated the range of outcomes, upside and downside, but there is still some unhedged exposure, about 60% of our foreign-denominated AFFO is unhedged. So for every 10% move in the dollar, for instance, you\u2019re looking at maybe $0.015 of volatility on an annualized basis. So, we\u2019re not completely hedged, which can lead to upside if we see some mean reversion here in the dollar. But just a little bit of conservatism that we\u2019re taking here sitting here in August.\nBrad Heffern: Okay. I appreciate all the color. And then, Sumit, some of your peers this quarter have talked about portfolios trading at a discount to single assets. Is that something that you\u2019ve seen? And are you interested potentially in pursuing more portfolio deals?\nSumit Roy: No more than in the past, Brad. Portfolio deals generally do tend to trade at a discount, especially in times like this when the cost of capital have gone up. And a lot of these potential buyers of big portfolios are sort of sitting on the sidelines. So this is essentially reverted back to where it was, where we would get a discount on portfolio transactions. And so if you look at our volume today, about 62% of what we did were portfolio transactions. So that actually accrues to our benefit, Brad, and we are certainly seeing exactly the same scenario as some of our peers have commented.\nBrad Heffern: Okay, thank you.\nSumit Roy: Sure.\nOperator: The next question is from Wes Golladay with Baird. Please go ahead.\nWes Golladay: Hi, everyone.\nChristie Kelly: Hi, Wes.\nWes Golladay: Hey there. I got a question also maybe on the FX, more so on the future hedging, I guess. As you buy more properties overseas, would you do more, I guess, CP issuance tip for the hedging? And could we see the U.S. issuance of CP maybe go down to zero and unusual full capacity overseas?\nJonathan Pong: Hey, Wes, it\u2019s Jonathan. I\u2019ll take that one. You may have seen our euro commercial paper program establishment recently, $1.5 billion equivalent together with the upsizing of our U.S. dollar commercial paper program. Focusing on the Euro CP side, we absolutely intend to utilize that to the extent that we have a use of euro currency. But right now, obviously, interest rates are much lower comparatively. We could probably issue one year year-old CP [ph] in a 25 basis point context and that compares to revolver borrowings that are 75 basis points or so. So certainly, having a liability and a very cheap liability at that denominated in euros will be additive on all fronts, limiting the amount of derivatives that we have to engage with to hedge our exposure and lowering the old interest rate that we have to pay on your borrowings.\nWes Golladay: Got it. And then want to go back to the comment, sorry, go ahead.\nSumit Roy: Yes, Wes, having said all of that, we will be leaning towards permanently financing our acquisitions as soon as possible. I mean this is really a mechanism for us to provide the surety to the market and take advantage of our A-/A3 rating. But this will continue to not dominate our overall debt profile. If you look at what our outstandings are today, it\u2019s about 7%. And that is how you should think about us running up business going forward.\nWes Golladay: Got it. Then I want to go back to that comment about why do you need cap rates. I\u2019m just curious if you\u2019re seeing any difference between sale leasebacks, marketed assets, developer takeouts, any of your channels that you look at?\nSumit Roy: Yes. It\u2019s not a function of the channel. I would say, Wes, it is much more a function of the overall market. If you are starting to see cap rates move in portfolio transactions, whether the portfolio comes from another seller or from a sale-leaseback avenue it\u2019s going to be reflective of markets. Does relationship play a hand? Sure, it does. But those are 5 basis points to 10 basis points to maybe 15 basis points at best. But it is really the market that dictates what those cap rates are going to be, not so much the channels.\nWes Golladay: Great, thanks a lot.\nSumit Roy: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nChristie Kelly: Hi, Josh.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Hey Christie, hey, guys. So now that you\u2019ve kind of completed the integration of the VEREIT merger, what \u2013 how are you guys thinking about additional M&A?\nSumit Roy: Josh, we won\u2019t let us breathe, will you?\nJoshua Dennerlein: You guys go to work hard. I mean, especially Jonathan, he got to work extra hard.\nSumit Roy: That\u2019s true. That\u2019s true. Josh, we\u2019ve always said that, look, as far as M&A is concerned, we are always open for opportunities. But it is not easy to facilitate an M&A trade. You need willing partners, you need the market environment to be conducive, you need to be able to look at the other portfolio to figure out, is there a massive amount of overlap in terms of strategically what we would have gone after had this entire portfolio been available. You then have to take into consideration social issues. There are so many things that sort of have to align before you can help facilitate an M&A trade. But having said all of that, and this is very consistent with what we\u2019ve said in the past, we are always looking. And if the right opportunity presents itself, we\u2019re not going to shy away from it. So, we\u2019ve shown that we can do it. We\u2019ve done it a couple of times now. And we\u2019ll keep looking and keep working hard, like you said, Josh.\nJoshua Dennerlein: And then I think you mentioned grocery anchors. It sounds like the cap rates moved like 100 basis points higher. Were there any other asset classes or property types where you\u2019re seeing that kind of magnitude of a move?\nSumit Roy: Yes. The industrial, I would say, not across the board, but some industrial, the movement has been quite pronounced as well, don\u2019t know if it\u2019s 100 basis points, but it wouldn\u2019t be far to say, 50 basis points to 75 basis points. I just felt like the grocery market decelerated, i.e. the compression of the cap rates was so immediate from where we used to buy grocery here in the U.S., in the high-5s, this was the best-in-class grocery it accelerated down to the low-4s. And this was absolutely a testament to the amount of capital that had come into our space and the cost of debt available that allow these buyers to essentially hit the yield that they required on a cash-on-cash basis. And the unwinding was as quick, partially driven by what the Fed chose to do, partially driven by how that translated into the debt market. And then the withdrawal of some of this capital that relied on the debt markets. So, I think that phenomena is very unique to that particular sector of retail. And we didn\u2019t see that compression in any other sector that I can think of.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Interesting. Thanks guys.\nOperator: The next question is from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRonald Kamdem: Hey, just a couple of quick ones staying on, maybe not..\nChristie Kelly: Hey, Ronald.\nRonald Kamdem: Hey, how are you? Just staying on the theme of large acquisitions, maybe M&A, but just even just bigger portfolio deals. I remember one of the benefits of sort of having a larger platform is being able to do these larger sale leasebacks, just any update on how that pipeline is building. And when can we see sort of more of those deals come through?\nSumit Roy: Yeah, Ron I'll tell you the pipelines is big. And we are in discussions on fairly sizable opportunities. Again, similar to my comments with regards to M&A, I think it's difficult, sellers are still a bit anchored on the past in terms of where the market was literally five to six months ago, and their willingness to sort of recognize the current state of affairs is what's going to dictate as to whether these conversations and these pipeline opportunities translate to under contract opportunities. But I can tell you, Ron, that our pipeline has never looked stronger and a lot of that makeup is from bigger portfolio transactions. And so we are hopeful that a few of these will get over the finish line, and if it does, you'll be the first to know.\nRonald Kamdem: Great. And if I could just ask one quick one on the guidance, just what's the assumption for \u2013 and sorry if you covered this already, what's the assumption for bad debt and that change at all, because it seems like that's been pretty low?\nSumit Roy: Yeah. Jonathan or Christie should take that.\nChristie Kelly: Yeah. In terms of we're on a bad debt. Yeah. There was no specific change as it relates to bad debt. And in terms of the impact, for example, we've talked a lot about the clients that we still have on cash accounting and the fact that the deferral arrangements for a good approximately handful of those that were primarily impacted during COVID in the theater and health and fitness space. Their deferral arrangements started in July. And so we will be looking at their continued strong collections performance and make the appropriate calls in relation to our policies and things as we continue through this year and determine if we will be taking any of those clients off of cash accounting. And some of that impact Ron, is also one of the variables that we factored in as it relates to the upper end of our guidance.\nRonald Kamdem: Thank you.\nJonathan Pong: Ron, I'll just add, in terms of the remainder of the year guidance we're really looking at more of a normalized assumption. So, the first half of the year we've actually benefited from some paybacks on deferral agreements that have actually resulted in flat or even negative bad debt expense. So a little bit of conservatism in back half of the year, just given the macro environment and uncertainties. But definitely assuming just a normalized run rate in a pre-pandemic year.\nRonald Kamdem: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from John Massocca with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead.\nJohn Massocca: Good afternoon.\nChristie Kelly: Hi John.\nJohn Massocca: How's it going? So as we think about the competitive environment you face in the Europe versus the U.S., I mean, how sensitive are your European competitors to rising rates? And I guess if we can see continued upper pressure on UK and EU rates, could it push certain competitors out of the market kind of similar to what you've seen in the U.S. year-to-date?\nSumit Roy: Absolutely. not trying to be flipping to John, but that is exactly what we expect to see happen. I think I mentioned that the BFA has just raised their interest rates by 50 basis points to 1.75%[ph]. We should start to see the cap rates adjust, but a lot of the levered buyers and those happen to be quite a few there. We will start to fall by the wayside. We've already seen that on a few transactions that we've been pursuing in the international markets. And again, this certainty of close is what gets amplified at times like this. And we've had transactions that literally have come back to us in the international markets, because they recognize our ability to close on especially large transactions. And so I expect, what we are seeing happen here in the U.S., a similar storyline to play out in the international markets and given that the level of competition that we face there, John is actually a lot less. We expect those advantages to be even more enhanced in quarters to come.\nJohn Massocca: And I guess maybe if we think back to kind of 3Q and 4Q of last year, I mean, how important was the non-public levered buyer in the European markets versus the U.S.? Is it kind of a bigger portion of the competitive set or is it equal less?\nSumit Roy: Yeah, that's very difficult to quantify, but if I had to guess, I would say that there are more of the buyers in Europe that rely on the debt markets. And what makes it challenging is that the debt markets are potentially not quite as mature as we have here in the U.S., the circa few fewer people that we were competing with for the kind of product that we've been pursuing. And this is consistent with one of our strategic reasons to expand into Europe is the lack of similar kinds of competition that we see here in the U.S. and more of an amplification of our inherent advantages in that particular market. And we are certainly starting to see that more so recently.\nJohn Massocca: Okay. And I know it's a relatively recent phenomenon, but as you think about tenant credit, both with acquisitions and the in-place portfolio, how are you thinking about sellers of kind of hard goods versus more services-oriented tenants, given some of the recent shifts in consumer demand?\nSumit Roy: Yeah, it does depend on the type of hard goods. I will tell you, Walmart just came out with another announcement today. They're getting pressured. But do I see Walmart struggling to pay their rent? I don't. Do I see now, if you were to look at categories, do I see apparel companies suffering a little bit more, especially if discretionary income continues to get pressured? Absolutely. Do I see quick service restaurants suffering the same? I don't. We saw this play out in the great financial crisis where some of the service oriented businesses actually thrived. The movie theater business did very well. The health and fitness business did quite well because, especially the lower cost health and fitness concepts, because they tend to attract the more value sensitive consumer base at times where alternatives have become a lot more expensive. I do expect, casual dining to feel a little bit more of the pressure. But again, the concepts are important who the operator is important, their balance sheet strength, their ability to take lessons learned from the pandemic where there were a lot more click and collects and deliveries that they were able to pivot to in terms of their business model. Those I think will hold them in good stead for the ones that survived and were able to institute those types of changes to their business model. But it's very much specific to the particular vertical and the environment we find ourselves in.\nJohn Massocca: Very helpful color. That's it for me. Thank you very much.\nSumit Roy: Thanks, John.\nOperator: The next question is from Chris Lucas with Capital One. Please go ahead.\nChristie Kelly: Hi there, Chris.\nChris Lucas: Good afternoon. Hi, Christy. Good afternoon, everybody. Just a follow-up question on the commercial paper program. I guess, I'm just thinking about it so you've got $1.5 billion denominated in \u20ac1.5 billion denominated. Was there a specific reason why euro denominated rather than pound denominated related to efficiency, depth of market future uses? Just trying to understand why euro and not pound?\nChristie Kelly: Sure. Chris.\nJonathan Pong: Hey Chris, it's Jonathan, you know, there's a nuance in the commercial paper market. The storage market is really not that big. So you don't really see a lot of stand-alone sterling programs. The Eurocommercial paper program does give us the flexibility to issue in sterling. And so to the extent there is demand in that market, we'll be able to tap into it. But by and large, this market is dominated by dollars and euros.\nChris Lucas: Okay. Great. Thank you for that. And then Sumit, just kind of taking a step back, sort of talk a little bit around the foreign exchange issue that's occurred this year. You've seen a pretty meaningful move in both in terms of the dollar appreciation relative to the euro and the pound. And if you kind of look historically back at this other than really like a week during COVID in March of 2020, you have to go all the way back to the Reagan [ph] Administration decline sort of this relative value on both the pound and on the, on the euro impact that far, but in terms of the dollar strength. So my question is, does that impact at all your view about where to allocate capital at this point? Or are you completely agnostic to the exchange rate?\nSumit Roy: It would be unfair to say, Chris, that we are agnostic to the exchange rate. Obviously, this is something that we have an acute focus on \u2013 like we said, we are not 100% hedged. That wouldn't be economically prudent to do so. We are about 40% hedged on our income stream. And we have instituted strategies to sort of mitigate fluctuations in the foreign exchange market. Having said all of that, we did exactly the same analysis, Chris, to figure out at which point in time where these exchange rates at current levels and concluded the same that look, again, I might look foolish in three months from now. But this looks like the low point in terms of foreign exchange between the GBP and the U.S. and the euro in the U.S. And you're starting to see with increases in interest rates by the Bank of England, similar to the ECB, you're starting to see that correct itself and start to revert a little bit more to the mean. So that could potentially act as a tailwind. But not knowing and not trying to take a forecast on where these things are going to play out. That's the reason \u2013 one of the main reasons why we kept our range exactly the same, but we believe that we are very well situated currently. Ultimately, this is a long game. And what we want is to let the product and the acquisition opportunities dictate with is with an eye on the exchange rate, dictate how we build out our portfolio. So totally not fair to say we would be agnostic, but it is something we keep in mind, but doesn't necessarily drive our strategy in its entirety.\nChris Lucas: Great. That\u2019s helpful. That\u2019s all I have this afternoon. Thank you.\nSumit Roy: Thank you, Chris.\nChristie Kelly: Thank you, Chris.\nOperator: The next question is from Harsh Hemnani with Green Street. Please go ahead.\nChristie Kelly: Hi, Harsh.\nHarsh Hemnani: Hey, Christie. A quick one for me. When you think about the investments in Europe, what percentage of them are sale-leaseback originations versus acquisitions of existing leases? And how does that compare to your investments in the U.S.?\nSumit Roy: I don't think that there is a major difference between the compositions. If you look at what we did on the sale leaseback side, Harsh, it was right around 28% year-to-date. And we've had quarters where it's been as high as 75% and we've had quarters where it's been as low as 20%. And so it really is a function of what's available, when is it closing in a given quarter, et cetera, that dictates the sale-leaseback piece. Having said that, I think when we do decide to pursue sale leasebacks in a meaningful way. It is possible that some of those transactions would be much larger in size. For instance, if you think about our inaugural transaction that we did when we first went into the U.K., it was a sale-leaseback that we did with Sainsbury's. That was $0.5 billion. If you think about the gaming industry and the sale leaseback we've done with them, it's going to dominate that particular quarter because it's a $1.7 billion transaction. And we see similar types of opportunities where when and if those close in a given quarter, it's going to dominate that particular quarter. And I don't think it's unique just to the U.S. I think it will be consistent between the U.S. and the international markets.\nHarsh Hemnani: Okay, thank you.\nSumit Roy: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nLinda Tsai: Hi.\nChristie Kelly: Hi, Linda.\nLinda Tsai: Hi Christie. In terms of the 2% growth in same-store revenue, I saw health and fitness and restaurants and materially theaters contributed to the positive change in second quarter same-store. When did the strong comps start to normalize? And is that partly dependent on cash basis payback?\nSumit Roy: It is. It's when we start to sort of take a lot of these clients off of the cash basis and get them back on accrual basis. You're still going to have a period of about 12 months where there's going to be this mismatch. And some of these higher, same-store rental growth that you're seeing is essentially a byproduct of moving some of these cash accounts back to accrual account. And once all of this normalizes, you should expect us to be back in that 1% to 1.5% same-store growth. But right now, it's a period where we are now starting to recognize and move some of these clients and case in point AMC back to accrual accounting, and that's disproportionately impacting the growth rate in a very favorable way.\nLinda Tsai: That's helpful. And then I think previously, you talked about putting some money into vacant properties to redevelop to help releasing prospects. Is this something you're still pursuing?\nSumit Roy: Very much so, Linda. And I think that is being captured in some of our re-leasing spreads that we've \u2013 that I'm so proud of the asset management team, over 105% essentially net with zero TI dollars. A lot of that \u2013 not a lot, but some of it is certainly driven by our repositioning. One of the highest recapture percentages that we had was taking a quick service concept and converting it into an alternative retail concept largely driven by a predictive analytics tool, saying that the best and use for this particular location is not a quick service restaurant, but this alternative concept. And we went down that path and we're able to recognize north of 200% in terms of recapture rates. And we share all of that information in aggregation with you on our supplemental so you can track some of that. But that is absolutely very much a focus of ours, Linda, and we hope that, that will continue to be \u2013 become a bigger and bigger portion of the value driver of our growth going forward.\nLinda Tsai: Thank you.\nSumit Roy: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Sumit Roy for any closing remarks.\nSumit Roy: Thank you all for joining us today. I hope everyone enjoys the rest of the summer, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Sumit. During the second quarter, our business generated $0.97 of AFFO per share, representing 10.2% year-over-year growth. The growth engine of our Company revolves around accretive acquisitions. Our investment goals are supported by our well-capitalized balance sheet and favorable cost of capital, which remain competitive advantages for us in the net lease industry. We finished the quarter well within our target leverage ratios with net debt-to-annualized adjusted EBITDAR of 5.3 times or 5.2 times on a pro forma basis, giving annualized effects to net investment activity during the quarter. It was another active quarter for us on the capital raising front. As we issued approximately $1.8 billion of long-term and permanent capital, including nearly $1.1 billion of equity through our ATM program and a \u00a3600 million private placement note offering which priced at a weighted average fixed interest rate of 3.22% with a blended tenure of 10.5 years. As a result, we finished the quarter with approximately $1 billion of commercial paper and revolver borrowings net of cash. Our outstanding CPE and revolver borrowings essentially represent our only variable rate debt exposure across a total debt principal balance of almost $16 billion. As Sumit mentioned previously, our ability to access well-priced capital is a competitive advantage and we took steps during the quarter to further bolster this capacity. As previously announced in April this year, we recasted and upsized our multicurrency revolving credit facility from $3 billion to $4.25 billion. Subsequent to quarter-end, we upsized our U.S. Commercial Paper Program from $1 billion to $1.5 billion and established our Euro Commercial Paper Program with a capacity of $1.5 billion. The combined $3 billion Commercial Paper Programs for which our revolving credit facility serves as a liquidity backstop will give us the flexibility to efficiently finance our short-term funding needs at materially lower rates than comparable facility borrowings. Given the momentum we continue to see in our investment activities in Europe, the establishment of a Euro program was a strategic goal of ours this year. And it will serve as an efficient tool for us to take advantage of the comparably lower all-in commercial paper rates in the Euro market. With the health of our portfolio and investment progress achieved year-to-date, balanced alongside the timing of capital deployment and continued capital markets volatility, we affirm our previously announced 2022 AFFO per share guidance of $3.84 to $3.97, representing nearly 9% annual growth at the mid-point. From a dividend perspective as the monthly dividend company, consistent quarterly increases in dividend reflects the confidence we have in the cash flow generated capacity of our business. In June, we increased our dividend for the 116th time in our company's history. And last month, we declared our 625th consecutive common stock monthly dividend. From a sustainability perspective, further in June, we published our green bond allocation report, and I'm pleased to report that the net proceeds from our inaugural green bond offering have been fully allocated to eligible green projects in accordance with the criteria outlined in our green financing framework. From a merger perspective lastly, I am pleased to report that we have completed the integration of our VEREIT merger, which culminated in the conversion to a single ERP system for the combined entities during the second quarter. This could not have been accomplished so seamlessly without the commitment and dedication of our talented one team. And finally, we remain on track to achieve the expected $45 million to $55 million of annualized run rate cost energies we initially shared over a year ago when we announced the merger. And now, I would like to pass the call back to Sumit. Hi, Michael. Hi, Nick. Hi, Connor. Hi, Haendel. Hey, Brad. Yes. I think, Brad, just to start off Sumit \u2013 Sumit had started to touch on this in terms of some of the moving pieces given the fact that we had increase our acquisition volume to over $6 billion, but kept as you observed in our AFFO per share guidance the same and reaffirmed it. And there are some factors there in terms of first, the volatility in the capital markets as we've discussed, the overall rate hikes and the magnitude of those hikes and any future actions that may be taken. Both in terms of the European and U.S. environments. We also to the point that you were making. We do actually hedge from the perspective of FX to protect our international income as well as we've got hedges in place to lower our effective interest rates, and we'll touch on that a bit more in a second. But the other thing too is that just the general timing of the investment volume, the team has just been doing a great job. We've got really strong momentum as Sumit discussed in the market. And the acquisitions that we close from now towards the end of the year, while our attractive are really going to be setting us up nicely for 2023. So the timing of that isn't as beneficial for the year in AFFO as it will be for the full year impact next year. And I think, to the upside, we still have some clients on cash accounting, that have just started under their deferral arrangements. And so we'll be monitoring them for continued consistent payment performance, and make the appropriate calls and alignment with our policy and guidelines when we may be taking them off of cash accounting. But I'd love to turn it over to Jonathan to talk a little bit more specifically about hedging and the impact. Hi, Wes. Hi, Josh. Hey, Ronald. Yeah. In terms of we're on a bad debt. Yeah. There was no specific change as it relates to bad debt. And in terms of the impact, for example, we've talked a lot about the clients that we still have on cash accounting and the fact that the deferral arrangements for a good approximately handful of those that were primarily impacted during COVID in the theater and health and fitness space. Their deferral arrangements started in July. And so we will be looking at their continued strong collections performance and make the appropriate calls in relation to our policies and things as we continue through this year and determine if we will be taking any of those clients off of cash accounting. And some of that impact Ron, is also one of the variables that we factored in as it relates to the upper end of our guidance. Hi John. Hi there, Chris. Sure. Chris. Thank you, Chris. Hi, Harsh. Hi, Linda."

            "name": "Sumit Roy",
            "content": "Thank you, Andrea. Welcome everyone. Cultivating strong and enduring relationships with all our stakeholders is foundational to the success of our business. And I'd like to thank everyone listening for your continued support. Additionally, I would like to express my appreciation to all my Realty Income colleagues who continue make significant contributions towards our growth initiatives, while serving our clients and all stakeholders as one Realty Income team. We are pleased with the momentum across all areas of our business amidst an uncertain macro environment, which we believe once again, demonstrates the stability of our business model and its ability to thrive irrespective of the economic cycle. The strength of our global investment pipeline has allowed us to invest over $3.2 billion in high-quality real estate in the first half of the year, including approximately $1.7 billion during the second quarter. Given this momentum, we are increasing our 2022 acquisitions guidance to over $6 billion. On the topic of acquisitions, I'd like to mention two key developments that we are observing in the marketplace. First, as demonstrated by the weighted average 5.7% cash cap rate, we were able to achieve on our investments in the second quarter, cap rates are moving higher in our target markets. Our second quarter cap rate ticked higher compared to the 5.6% and 5.4% cap rates we achieved in the previous two quarters. The positive correlation between cap rates and interest rate is also evident in our acquisition pipeline. Second, as a corollary to rising debt and equity costs that have impacted much of our competition, the pipeline of acquisition opportunities materializing for us at accretive spreads continues to grow. As a reminder, we report our cap rates on a cash basis. On a straight line basis, we estimate our second quarter cap rate to be approximately 6.2%. And generally, the difference between cash and straight line cap rates ranges between 50 and 70 basis points in any given period. Transaction flow remains strong with sourcing volume totaling approximately $26 billion in this quarter, bringing year-to-date sourcing volume to approximately $60 billion. We remain selective as we have acquired approximately 5% of sourced volume year-to-date. During the second quarter as percentage of revenue, approximately 39% of acquisition volume was leased to investment-grade rated clients. We remain committed to our underwriting principles of partnering with well capitalized clients who are leaders in their respective industries. Our international investment volume continues to comprise a significant percentage of our total volume, representing 41% of global volume in the second quarter at a cash cap rate of approximately 5.8%. We are encouraged that our size, scale and access to well-priced capital provides us with the platform and currency to actively deploy capital as we build continued momentum heading into 2023. It was also an active quarter with regard to dispositions. We sold 70 properties, generating net sale proceeds of $150 million at an unlevered IRR of approximately 9.3%. Year-to-date, we have sold 104 properties with net sales proceeds totaling $272 million, generating an unlevered IRR of approximately 9.4%. Capital recycling continues to be a value accretive activity for us. And importantly, the unlevered returns we have been able to deliver speak to the attractive risk adjusted investment profile of our properties that have gone through our full investment cycle. Our diligent underwriting process, exposure to high-quality credit clients and the inherent quality of our real estate continue to deliver consistent performance. At the end of the second quarter, our occupancy was 98.9%, the highest occupancy rate we have achieved in over 10 years. Based on our current occupancy rates and client profile, we are increasing our year-end 2022 occupancy guidance to over 98%. During the second quarter, we re-leased 193 leases and achieved a rent recapture rate of 105.6%, bringing our year-to-date recapture rate to 105.9%. At quarter-end, 43.2% of our portfolios annualized contractual rent was generated from investment-grade rated clients. Further, our properties leased to clients on our portfolio watch list represents less than 4% of our portfolios analyze contractual rent, which is largely consistent with the low percentages we have seen so far this year. Finally, our same-store rental revenue increased 2% during the quarter and 3% year-to-date. With a continued strong operations performance of our portfolio, we are increasing our guidance for same-store rent growth to approximately 2% for 2022. At this time, I'll pass it over to Christie, who will further discuss results from the quarter. Thank you, Christie. Coming off a record 2021 from an investment standpoint, I'm proud that our team has only accelerated the momentum this year. Most importantly, we believe the future is bright as our positioning to further gain market share in the investment arena grows. Indeed, the advantages afforded to us given our size scale and access to well priced capital have rarely been more pronounced than they are today. And we look forward to continuing to capitalize on this in the days ahead. At this time, we can open it up for questions. Operator? That's a good question, Michael, because there are competing variables in this market today. You're absolutely right. That cap rates are moving in the right direction. There are adjusting a lot quicker than I had originally anticipated. We do have a much bigger team. And with the VEREIT merger, some of the team members that we have inherited, they are definitely producing and focusing on a certain area of the high real market that is actually resulting in transactions for us. The offset to that, however, is the capital market. Look, on a relative basis, we are doing very well. If you look at our tenure unsecured bond spreads, they have moved, I would say approximately 85 basis points. You look at our peers, our net lease peers with a BBB rating, it's moved 120 basis points to 150 basis points. If you look at our cost of equity, it is essentially unchanged from the beginning of the year. But if you look at our net lease peers, they've dropped by about 1.8 times. So those are the positive momentums, but it is true also that our cost of capital overall has also increased. And the question really is around, can we generate the right spreads to move the needle on the overall AFFO per share growth? And the answer is yes. But as you know, there is an adjustment period, which is why we have increased our acquisition guidance to over $6 billion from over $5 billion as a testament to what we are seeing in terms of benefits accruing to us, based on some of what I just discussed. We are starting to see a lot more transactions coming back to us those that we were not willing to price at the levels that the sellers were expecting when they initially brought it to us, are now coming back with an adjusted cap rate, which works. It is also true that the overall team has been able to just source more and those are sort of shown in the sourcing volumes that, that we have shared with you of $60 billion year-to-date. But with interest rate movements and more importantly, the velocity at which these interest rates have moved, the spreads continue to be right around at 110 basis points, 111 basis points year-to-date, which is slightly below our overall average. So that's the reason why that this positive momentum is being reflected in higher acquisition volume, but not necessarily translating into higher earnings guidance. Yes. Michael, it fluctuates. I mean there have been quarters actually where the international acquisition number has been not the 50% of the overall volume. And as we start to grow into newer markets, et cetera, obviously, the total addressable market continues to increase for us. And as we become much more mature in each one of these newer markets, the sourced volume as well as which translates to closed volume will increase. But I wouldn't go so far as to say that, at this point in time, we should be thinking anything north of this 40% number 41% is what we achieved in the second quarter, as being it should be the guiding composition of the overall acquisition numbers going forward. There will be quarters where we'll do more just like we've done in the past, but 40% seems to be the right number. Thank you, Mike. Sure. That's a great question, Nick, and welcome back to our space. I would say that the movement in cap rates here in the U.S. are certainly much more pronounced than what we have seen in the international markets. And it is largely a function of the Fed being a lot more aggressive than the ECB or the Bank of England have been. Having said that, we just saw an announcement earlier today that the Bank of England has moved its interest rates 50 basis points. So we do see that translating to higher cap rates in the UK as well as in the rest of Continental Europe. So just to quantify some of these movements, I would say that depending on the product, and when I say retail, you can go from groceries, which have moved the most because they had become the most aggressive, they've moved up about a 100 basis points to some of the other industries that we focus on within the retail space, I would quantify that movement is being right around 25 basis points to 50 basis points. And you should start to see that being reflected in the subsequent quarters and the acquisition cap rates \u2013 cash cap rates that we are going to share with the market going forward. In the \u2013 in Europe, we have also seen movement, but it hasn't been quite as pronounced maybe 5 basis points to 10 basis points. On the industrial side, the movement has been a bit more visible 25 basis points to 50 basis points, similar to what we experienced here in the U.S. But I would say the industrial market has continued to see an expansion on cap rates. And I would say, from beginning to end, maybe you circa 50 basis points of movement on average. Now, obviously, there are certain markets where the movement has been a lot, lot less than that Inland Empire comes to mind. But the more secondary tertiary markets, you have seen a more pronounced movement than it could be even north of 50 to 75 basis. Yes. It's largely buyers that rely on the debt capital markets either the CMBS market or the bank loan market. You are in New York, you know what the money market, the big banks, the BofAs, the JPMorgans, the Wells, I'm not going to say that they have a moratorium on new loans, but it is much more difficult for them to create new bank debt or increased revolvers, et cetera, for more distress credit. So the overall debt market has sort of become a lot more expensive for some of these levered buyers. And that's what we've seen is that they're no longer being able to honor the original cap rates that transactions were being struck at. And of course, we chose not to pursue those transactions at those given pricing. And so when they do come back to us and as long as we like the transaction, it was just a pricing discussion. We are being able to now, either honor the cap rate that we had or even expand out those cap rates to reflect current market conditions. But the fact that the surety of close has become so much more important for the sellers today is clearly prevalent in a lot of the discussions that we are having with the sellers today. Sure. Yes, it's a great question. And unfortunately, if we were in a lab where we could control all variables that sort of drive this correlation, it would be a lot easier of an answer to give you. Historically, when we've done these correlations, we have found that the lag to be anywhere between nine to perhaps even as long as 12 months. I was a lot more skeptical coming into this particular situation coming into this year and seeing the rising interest rate environment. Just because of the \u2013 the sheer volume of capital that has come into our space on the institutional side. And I was a bit hesitant to continue to say, hey, it's going to be this nine to 12 month lag before cap rates start to reflect the new environment, because of this wealth of capital. However, what I didn't take into account was the debt markets adjusting as quickly as they did. And even this new capital that has come into our space, both on the private equity side, as well as on the public side of the equation. The debt markets adjusted a lot faster. And therefore the pullback from these newer buyers in our space has been a lot more acute, which has resulted in cap rates adjusting a lot faster. I mean, we've had a rising interest rate environment now for the last six months. And we are already starting to see cap rates adjust 25 to 50 basis points. And like I said, in the grocery sector, we saw sale leasebacks being done in the low fours that are now coming back and being done in the low fives to mid fives. So it's not a constant Connor that I can point to. It is a reflection of the environment that you're faced with, but it's a good thing for us truth be told that cap rates can adjust, as quickly as they have in a rising interest rate environment. I just hope that the corollary is not true. Thanks. Hi, Haendel. Yes. This is a narrative that continues to be out there that we are not focused or that we are disproportionately focused on the high grade side of the equation. Just look at what we did this quarter. I mean, 62% of what we did was sub-investment grade or non-rated. So it is \u2013 I don't believe true to say that all we focus on is investment grade credit and that particular product. What we have tried to share with the market clearly unsuccessfully. So that we focus on risk adjusted returns that are points in time where the risk adjusted returns on investment grade credit is far superior to what we were seeing on the non-investment grade side. And we pivot there and we try to do those transactions. And then there are other times where the exact opposite is true, where sub-investment grade is allowing you to capture risk adjusted returns that are far superior. And so we find ourselves in that period today, where we are finding very good opportunities on the non-investment grade side of the equation, and as such are being able to get a lot of those transactions over the finish line, i.e., 62% in the second quarter. So we are indifferent to the credit ratings. What we focus on is looking at the totality of that particular opportunity to then ascribe a return profile that makes sense for the risk that we are undertaking. And that will continue to vary. We don't target investment grade. Investment grade tends to be a byproduct of the underwriting. So hopefully that clarifies the question you asked. Still on track, we are quite optimistic. We've continued to stay very close to the MGC. We are working very closely with them, so we are very optimistic that it'll close by the end of this year in the fourth quarter. Sure. No more than in the past, Brad. Portfolio deals generally do tend to trade at a discount, especially in times like this when the cost of capital have gone up. And a lot of these potential buyers of big portfolios are sort of sitting on the sidelines. So this is essentially reverted back to where it was, where we would get a discount on portfolio transactions. And so if you look at our volume today, about 62% of what we did were portfolio transactions. So that actually accrues to our benefit, Brad, and we are certainly seeing exactly the same scenario as some of our peers have commented. Sure. Yes, Wes, having said all of that, we will be leaning towards permanently financing our acquisitions as soon as possible. I mean this is really a mechanism for us to provide the surety to the market and take advantage of our A-/A3 rating. But this will continue to not dominate our overall debt profile. If you look at what our outstandings are today, it's about 7%. And that is how you should think about us running up business going forward. Yes. It's not a function of the channel. I would say, Wes, it is much more a function of the overall market. If you are starting to see cap rates move in portfolio transactions, whether the portfolio comes from another seller or from a sale-leaseback avenue it's going to be reflective of markets. Does relationship play a hand? Sure, it does. But those are 5 basis points to 10 basis points to maybe 15 basis points at best. But it is really the market that dictates what those cap rates are going to be, not so much the channels. Thank you. Josh, we won't let us breathe, will you? That's true. That's true. Josh, we've always said that, look, as far as M&A is concerned, we are always open for opportunities. But it is not easy to facilitate an M&A trade. You need willing partners, you need the market environment to be conducive, you need to be able to look at the other portfolio to figure out, is there a massive amount of overlap in terms of strategically what we would have gone after had this entire portfolio been available. You then have to take into consideration social issues. There are so many things that sort of have to align before you can help facilitate an M&A trade. But having said all of that, and this is very consistent with what we've said in the past, we are always looking. And if the right opportunity presents itself, we're not going to shy away from it. So, we've shown that we can do it. We've done it a couple of times now. And we'll keep looking and keep working hard, like you said, Josh. Yes. The industrial, I would say, not across the board, but some industrial, the movement has been quite pronounced as well, don't know if it's 100 basis points, but it wouldn't be far to say, 50 basis points to 75 basis points. I just felt like the grocery market decelerated, i.e. the compression of the cap rates was so immediate from where we used to buy grocery here in the U.S., in the high-5s, this was the best-in-class grocery it accelerated down to the low-4s. And this was absolutely a testament to the amount of capital that had come into our space and the cost of debt available that allow these buyers to essentially hit the yield that they required on a cash-on-cash basis. And the unwinding was as quick, partially driven by what the Fed chose to do, partially driven by how that translated into the debt market. And then the withdrawal of some of this capital that relied on the debt markets. So, I think that phenomena is very unique to that particular sector of retail. And we didn't see that compression in any other sector that I can think of. Yeah, Ron I'll tell you the pipelines is big. And we are in discussions on fairly sizable opportunities. Again, similar to my comments with regards to M&A, I think it's difficult, sellers are still a bit anchored on the past in terms of where the market was literally five to six months ago, and their willingness to sort of recognize the current state of affairs is what's going to dictate as to whether these conversations and these pipeline opportunities translate to under contract opportunities. But I can tell you, Ron, that our pipeline has never looked stronger and a lot of that makeup is from bigger portfolio transactions. And so we are hopeful that a few of these will get over the finish line, and if it does, you'll be the first to know. Yeah. Jonathan or Christie should take that. Absolutely. not trying to be flipping to John, but that is exactly what we expect to see happen. I think I mentioned that the BFA has just raised their interest rates by 50 basis points to 1.75%[ph]. We should start to see the cap rates adjust, but a lot of the levered buyers and those happen to be quite a few there. We will start to fall by the wayside. We've already seen that on a few transactions that we've been pursuing in the international markets. And again, this certainty of close is what gets amplified at times like this. And we've had transactions that literally have come back to us in the international markets, because they recognize our ability to close on especially large transactions. And so I expect, what we are seeing happen here in the U.S., a similar storyline to play out in the international markets and given that the level of competition that we face there, John is actually a lot less. We expect those advantages to be even more enhanced in quarters to come. Yeah, that's very difficult to quantify, but if I had to guess, I would say that there are more of the buyers in Europe that rely on the debt markets. And what makes it challenging is that the debt markets are potentially not quite as mature as we have here in the U.S., the circa few fewer people that we were competing with for the kind of product that we've been pursuing. And this is consistent with one of our strategic reasons to expand into Europe is the lack of similar kinds of competition that we see here in the U.S. and more of an amplification of our inherent advantages in that particular market. And we are certainly starting to see that more so recently. Yeah, it does depend on the type of hard goods. I will tell you, Walmart just came out with another announcement today. They're getting pressured. But do I see Walmart struggling to pay their rent? I don't. Do I see now, if you were to look at categories, do I see apparel companies suffering a little bit more, especially if discretionary income continues to get pressured? Absolutely. Do I see quick service restaurants suffering the same? I don't. We saw this play out in the great financial crisis where some of the service oriented businesses actually thrived. The movie theater business did very well. The health and fitness business did quite well because, especially the lower cost health and fitness concepts, because they tend to attract the more value sensitive consumer base at times where alternatives have become a lot more expensive. I do expect, casual dining to feel a little bit more of the pressure. But again, the concepts are important who the operator is important, their balance sheet strength, their ability to take lessons learned from the pandemic where there were a lot more click and collects and deliveries that they were able to pivot to in terms of their business model. Those I think will hold them in good stead for the ones that survived and were able to institute those types of changes to their business model. But it's very much specific to the particular vertical and the environment we find ourselves in. Thanks, John. It would be unfair to say, Chris, that we are agnostic to the exchange rate. Obviously, this is something that we have an acute focus on \u2013 like we said, we are not 100% hedged. That wouldn't be economically prudent to do so. We are about 40% hedged on our income stream. And we have instituted strategies to sort of mitigate fluctuations in the foreign exchange market. Having said all of that, we did exactly the same analysis, Chris, to figure out at which point in time where these exchange rates at current levels and concluded the same that look, again, I might look foolish in three months from now. But this looks like the low point in terms of foreign exchange between the GBP and the U.S. and the euro in the U.S. And you're starting to see with increases in interest rates by the Bank of England, similar to the ECB, you're starting to see that correct itself and start to revert a little bit more to the mean. So that could potentially act as a tailwind. But not knowing and not trying to take a forecast on where these things are going to play out. That's the reason \u2013 one of the main reasons why we kept our range exactly the same, but we believe that we are very well situated currently. Ultimately, this is a long game. And what we want is to let the product and the acquisition opportunities dictate with is with an eye on the exchange rate, dictate how we build out our portfolio. So totally not fair to say we would be agnostic, but it is something we keep in mind, but doesn't necessarily drive our strategy in its entirety. Thank you, Chris. I don't think that there is a major difference between the compositions. If you look at what we did on the sale leaseback side, Harsh, it was right around 28% year-to-date. And we've had quarters where it's been as high as 75% and we've had quarters where it's been as low as 20%. And so it really is a function of what's available, when is it closing in a given quarter, et cetera, that dictates the sale-leaseback piece. Having said that, I think when we do decide to pursue sale leasebacks in a meaningful way. It is possible that some of those transactions would be much larger in size. For instance, if you think about our inaugural transaction that we did when we first went into the U.K., it was a sale-leaseback that we did with Sainsbury's. That was $0.5 billion. If you think about the gaming industry and the sale leaseback we've done with them, it's going to dominate that particular quarter because it's a $1.7 billion transaction. And we see similar types of opportunities where when and if those close in a given quarter, it's going to dominate that particular quarter. And I don't think it's unique just to the U.S. I think it will be consistent between the U.S. and the international markets. Thank you. It is. It's when we start to sort of take a lot of these clients off of the cash basis and get them back on accrual basis. You're still going to have a period of about 12 months where there's going to be this mismatch. And some of these higher, same-store rental growth that you're seeing is essentially a byproduct of moving some of these cash accounts back to accrual account. And once all of this normalizes, you should expect us to be back in that 1% to 1.5% same-store growth. But right now, it's a period where we are now starting to recognize and move some of these clients and case in point AMC back to accrual accounting, and that's disproportionately impacting the growth rate in a very favorable way. Very much so, Linda. And I think that is being captured in some of our re-leasing spreads that we've \u2013 that I'm so proud of the asset management team, over 105% essentially net with zero TI dollars. A lot of that \u2013 not a lot, but some of it is certainly driven by our repositioning. One of the highest recapture percentages that we had was taking a quick service concept and converting it into an alternative retail concept largely driven by a predictive analytics tool, saying that the best and use for this particular location is not a quick service restaurant, but this alternative concept. And we went down that path and we're able to recognize north of 200% in terms of recapture rates. And we share all of that information in aggregation with you on our supplemental so you can track some of that. But that is absolutely very much a focus of ours, Linda, and we hope that, that will continue to be \u2013 become a bigger and bigger portion of the value driver of our growth going forward. Thank you. Thank you all for joining us today. I hope everyone enjoys the rest of the summer, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon. Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon. My name is David and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I\u2019d like to welcome everyone to Realty Income\u2019s First Quarter 2022 Operating Results Conference Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Julie Hasselwander, Senior Manager of Investor Relations at Realty Income, you may begin your conference.\nJulie Hasselwander: Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income\u2019s first quarter 2022 operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer and Christie Kelly, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. During this conference call, we will make certain statements that maybe considered forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The company\u2019s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company\u2019s Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you would like to ask additional questions, you may reenter the queue. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy.\nSumit Roy: Thanks, Julie. Welcome everyone. 2022 is off to a strong start, and we are continuing to build momentum in our business. I want to express my deep appreciation of our One Team whose dedication and collaboration showcased the strength of our team through a timely closing of the first quarter, while integrating new processes and systems following the close of the VEREIT merger last November. All integration efforts are progressing and we remain committed to delivering continued scalability. We continue to make progress on our ESG initiatives and partnerships with our clients. In April, we published our second annual sustainability report, which details our commitments, goals and progress on our ESG efforts. I welcome all Realty Income stakeholders to share in our dedication to build sustainable relationships for the benefit of those we serve and encourage everyone listening to read through our 2021 sustainability report, which can be found in the Corporate Responsibility page of our website. Looking at macro trends, inflation persists as an important topic on the minds of many stakeholders and I want to emphasize that we believe our business is by design well-positioned to drive value in this climate. Our business model is one that generates significant recurring revenue that flows through to the bottom line. As a triple net lease REIT, our business is insulated from inflation. Our clients are responsible for covering taxes, insurance and other operating expenses. And as prices increase, many of our clients pass the incremental cost burden on to their consumers or suppliers. The efficiency of our model is reflected in our adjusted EBITDA margin, which is routinely around 94%. Maintaining a conservative capital structure has been a key tenet of our business since our founding and having a well-staggered fixed rate debt maturity schedule with no corporate bond maturities until 2024 limits on debt refinancing risk in a rising rate environment. In summary, we believe the appeal of our consistent and predictable stream of cash flows is amplified during periods of volatility like we find ourselves in today. To that end, we look at the last period in which the Federal Reserve increased interest rates from December 2015 through 2018 as a helpful case study. During this period, Realty Income\u2019s total return outperformed the S&P 500 and the MSCI U.S. REIT Index both in year 1 of the rate hike cycle and throughout the 3-year duration of that cycle. And during the Great Recession, Realty Income exhibited less operational and financial volatility as compared to many other S&P 500 REITs that carry A credit ratings. From an organic growth standpoint, our asset management team continues to report impressive recapture rates. This quarter, we recaptured over 106% of rental revenue on expiring leases. Given our lease expiration schedule and proven rent recapture track record, we believe we are well-positioned to manage through an inflationary environment. Through 2024, nearly 12% of our portfolio annualized contractual rent is set to expire. And in this regard, inflation could serve as a tailwind to our business as rents and costs to build rise. On the acquisition front, our transaction flow remains strong. Certain categories of the market, has seen discernible increase in cap rates, which we believe should accrue to our advantage as a net acquirer. Historically, we have observed that when interest rates increase, cap rates are just following a lag period of 6 to 12 months. Much of this cap rate expansion can be attributed to levered buyers who have relied upon record low debt pricing to underwrite their returns. Given the current yield environment, we are in a comparatively strong position given our financing strategy. And as such, we would expect our competitive standing to strengthen further. Now, turning to the results for the quarter, our size and scale, in conjunction with strong relationships we have across the marketplace, continue to provide benefits through robust sourcing and acquisition volumes. This quarter, we sourced over $34 billion of acquisition opportunities. And approximately 40% of this amount was sourced from international markets. Our total property level acquisitions for the quarter, was approximately $1.6 billion. Approximately half of our volume in the first quarter was the result of international investments, bringing our total international portfolio to approximately $5 billion of invested capital. As we announced in February, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire the Encore Boston Harbor Resort and Casino leased to Wynn Resorts under a 30-year triple net lease with favorable annual rent increases. The $1.7 billion transaction includes more than 3.1 million square feet of high-quality real estate less than 5 miles from Downtown Boston. Pending regulatory procedures, we continue to anticipate this transaction closing during the fourth quarter of 2022. We believe the market is efficient. And while cap rates have stabilized, significant competition remains with the high-quality assets we pursue. Our average initial cash cap rate for the quarter was 5.6%, which reflects the quality of locations and clients we are adding to our portfolio. As a reminder, we report our cap rates on a cash basis. We estimate the difference between cash and straight line cap rates to be approximately an additional 70 basis points in the first quarter. The weighted average remaining lease term of the assets added to our portfolio during the quarter was 12.3 years and the top industry invested during the quarter was grocery stores. We continue to have access to attractively priced capital, which has allowed us to maintain healthy spreads on our investments even as interest rates rise. We are pleased with the continued strength of our core operations. We ended the quarter with our portfolio at 98.6% occupancy based on property count. The weighted average remaining lease term of our overall portfolio is approximately 8.9 years, which as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we see as an advantage. As leases roll, we continue to favorably recapture rent as a result of diligent underwriting and the inherent quality of our real estate enhanced by the proactive efforts of our experienced asset management team. This quarter, we re-leased 119 leases, recapturing 106.2% of expiring rent. And since our public listing in 1994, we have executed 4,260 re-leases or sales on expiring leases, recapturing over 101% of rent on those re-leased contracts. We continue to report our quarterly recapture rates, because we believe this is one of the most objective ways to measure underlying portfolio quality in the net lease industry. During the quarter, we sold 34 properties, generating net proceeds of approximately $122 million. Approximately, 84% of the sales volume during the quarter related to former VEREIT properties that were sold rated. And our portfolio delivered healthy same-store rent growth increasing 4.1% during the quarter. This was largely attributed to the reversal of $9.4 million of rental revenue reserves during the quarter within the same store pool compared to a reserve of $8 million recognized for the same pool during the year ago period. Excluding the impact of reserves in both periods, we estimate that our same-store rent growth would have been approximately 1.2%. At this time, I will pass it over to Christie who will further discuss results from the quarter.\nChristie Kelly: Thank you, Sumit. During the first quarter, our business generated AFFO per share of $0.98 supported by a strong acquisition pace and a healthy portfolio. As Sumit mentioned, during the quarter, we recognized a $9.4 million reversal of non-straight line rental revenue reserves. This was primarily driven by the $7.7 million reversal of our outstanding reserves related to AMC, reflecting the recovery from the pandemic. Given the performance of our One Team, the health of our portfolio and progress achieved during the first quarter of 2022, we reaffirm our previously announced 2022 AFFO per share guidance of $3.84 to $3.97, representing 8.8% annual growth at the midpoint. From a leverage standpoint, we ended the quarter with a net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDAR of 5.4x in line with our target leverage ratios. And our near-term debt maturities remain minimal with a well-staggered predominantly fixed rate debt maturity schedule and no corporate bond maturities until 2024. As Sumit mentioned in his opening remarks, our modest debt maturity schedule through the end of next year limits our refinancing risk in a raising rate environment. Our size and scale provide us access to attractively price debt across several markets. For example, in January, we issued \u00a3500 million in sterling-denominated senior unsecured notes, pricing 5-year and 20-year notes at a blended all-in yield of 2.28% with a weighted average term of 12.5 years. During the quarter, we issued over $660 million of equity primarily through our ATM program. And subsequent to the quarter end, we entered into a definitive agreement for the private placement of a \u00a3600 million sterling-denominated offering of senior unsecured notes, pricing 8-year, 10-year and 15-year notes at a weighted average fixed rate of 3.22%, with a weighted average tenor of approximately 10.5 years. We greatly appreciate the support from the investors who have participated in our capital markets transactions. Finally, just last week, we announced the recast and upsizing of our credit facility, which now includes a $4.25 billion multicurrency revolving line of credit with an initial maturity in June 2026 and two 6-month extension options as well as a $1 billion accordion feature. At our current credit rating, the new revolving line of credit provides a borrowing rate of adjusted SOFR plus 72.5 basis points as compared to our previous credit facility of LIBOR plus 77.5 basis points. In total, 25 lenders participated in our recast and we greatly appreciate the support of our relationship banks, many of whom have supported us for decades and have been integral towards our growth. We have been most active during the last 12 months within corporate finance and capital markets. I\u2019d like to make special mention of Jonathan Pong and his team who have worked tirelessly to bring our corporate financing strategies and capital markets execution together with our partners to fruition on behalf of all whom we serve. Realty Income was founded on the principles of income generation and capital preservation. We remain committed to delivering monthly dividends that increase over time as part of a consistently attractive total shareholder return proposition. In March, we celebrated the payment of our 620th monthly dividend by virtually bringing the New York Stock Exchange closing bell. At Realty Income, the dividend is sacrosanct and we are proud to be one of only three REITs in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index for having raised our dividend for at least 25 consecutive years. And the value of our business is largely tied to current income as a recurring cash flow vehicle. As a result, the value proposition of owning Realty Income is comparatively more attractive during inflationary periods versus those whose value is tied to growth in future years. And now, I would like to pass the call back to Sumit.\nSumit Roy: Thank you, Christie. Our business continues to perform and we are well-positioned to build on our momentum throughout 2022 and beyond. These are interesting times and I remain encouraged by our One Team\u2019s creativity and work effort. We remain steadfast in our pursuit of providing our stakeholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns over the long-term. Thank you again to our team and partners for helping us deliver these results and to our stakeholders for their continued support. With that, I\u2019d like to open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nBrad Heffern: Hey, everyone.\nChristie Kelly: Hi, Brad.\nBrad Heffern: Hi, Christie. Sumit, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you have seen an increase in cap rates in certain categories. Can you give more color there and are there differences by credit quality or geography?\nSumit Roy: Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Brad. Good question. I think the most obvious difference in cap rates \u2013 increasing cap rates we see is in the industrial sector and more so here in the U.S. than in the international markets. I would say if I was asked to quantify what this change is in terms of what we were seeing in the third and fourth quarter of last year to what we started to see in the first quarter and beyond of this year, I would say it\u2019s in the tune of 25 to 50 basis points of increase in cap rates on the industrial sector. We are also starting to see on the retail side some of the transactions that were struck again in the fourth quarter of last year with potential levered buyers coming back. And certainty of close is taking on paramount importance with regards to the sellers and they are coming back at slightly higher cap rates. We see this more on the larger dollar retail acquisition opportunities, not so much on the QSR and smaller opportunities. But we are starting to see movement higher on the retail side, but it is not as dominant and it\u2019s not as widespread as we see it on the industrial side.\nBrad Heffern: Okay. Thank you for that. And then are you seeing any companies that potentially wouldn\u2019t have been interested in sale leaseback in the past come in just given the higher cost of alternative forms of financing?\nSumit Roy: Yes. I think part of it is that sale leaseback may potentially be a better avenue to raise capital and monetize their real estate, but I think part of it is also the maturation of the sale leaseback market, especially here in the U.S. We are starting to see first time operators engaging in sale leaseback conversations and a lot of it is not necessarily being generated by activist investors coming into play. A lot of it is organic. This is becoming part of their balance sheet management strategy going forward. And some of these are much larger than what we have typically seen in years past. And when I say that, I mean with $1 billion in front rather than $1 million. And to us, it is a function of the maturation of the sale leaseback market and of course, also what is happening on the CMBS and secured debt markets today.\nBrad Heffern: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Sure. Next, we will go to Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank. Your line is open.\nChristie Kelly: Hi, Greg.\nSumit Roy: Greg, you maybe on mute.\nOperator: Yes, Greg. Your line is open.\nGreg McGinniss: I certainly was. Thank you so much, Sumit. So, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Christie, the line of credit can now support a pretty significant level of acquisition activity. Just curious how you are thinking about maybe debt raises through the balance of the year, where do you anticipate you could raise debt and then thoughts on sterling and euro debt versus dollar debt at this point?\nChristie Kelly: Yes. Thanks for that, Greg. Yes, we are very excited about the renewal of our $4.25 billion credit facility. The team just did a great job, and we\u2019ve got great support from a lineup of banks. In terms of indicative pricing right now, 10-year U.S. treasuries, we just received this morning above 4%, call it, 4.2%, 4.3%. When we look at sterling, we\u2019re probably in 3.7% range. And then euro-related debt, high 2s, 2.8% to 3%. And as you know, part of our strategy is to really take advantage of the European execution from a liability perspective. And so as part of our capital strategy, we\u2019d be looking to execute in sterling. And depending on how things pan out throughout the rest of the year, potentially execute from a euro perspective as well.\nGreg McGinniss: Okay. And then in terms of how you might be thinking about raising debt this year, I mean, do you guys feel a need to get more permanent financing versus using the revolver? Or are you comfortable just based on where the acquisition guidance is just continuing to load up there?\nChristie Kelly: I think what you can expect from us, Greg, is to just really be consistent as we executed, for example, in April with the private placement of approximately $800 million. We have a delayed draw on that. So the paydown is in June. And as you mentioned, we\u2019ve got our revolver, and we also have our commercial paper program that is even further pricing inside the revolver. So we\u2019ve got a lot of opportunity here in front of us to fund our acquisition volume and do so within the range of guidance.\nGreg McGinniss: Okay, thank you very much.\nChristie Kelly: Thanks, Greg.\nOperator: Next, we will go to Nicholas Joseph with Citi. Your line is open.\nNicholas Joseph: Thank you. Maybe just following up on that line of questioning. Just with the sterling debt issuance and the other capital raising, how hedged are you from a cash flow and asset exposure perspective today?\nChristie Kelly: Hi, Nick. Yes. So from a hedging perspective, we have hedges in place that we\u2019ve executed both from an interest rate perspective. The team executed those back in the 2020 time period in June. And as you can imagine, we\u2019re in the money. And it was very well designed as it relates to the current environment.\nNicholas Joseph: Thanks. And then just on external growth. I mean just given the 1Q activity and then the casino deal under contract, what were your thoughts on moving acquisition guidance with this earnings release?\nSumit Roy: Nick, sorry, you cut off. Could you repeat that last question, please?\nNicholas Joseph: Sure. Can you hear me?\nSumit Roy: Yes, I can. Go ahead.\nNicholas Joseph: Yes. So the question was just on maintained acquisition guidance, just given the pace of acquisitions year-to-date and then also with the casino under contract for later in the year, if there are thoughts of moving up the acquisition guidance or just given kind of the uncertainty in the market, how that all blended together in your thinking?\nSumit Roy: Yes. So Nick, if you recall, when we first came out with our guidance, this was in late October, I think, of last year, which was very unusual for us, and a lot of what was driving that thinking then was making sure that people were able to underwrite what this merger was going to mean for the pro forma company. And we had come out with a number of $5 billion, approximately $5 billion. We haven\u2019t changed that. And like you\u2019ve said, we\u2019ve obviously made the announcement subsequent to that initial guidance of a $1.7 billion transaction. And what I can share with you, Nick, is not all of that $1.7 billion was contemplated when we had first come out with the $5 billion. In fact, we weren\u2019t even sure we had a deal at that time. So could that $5 billion go up? Yes. But what I \u2013 what keeps us a little bit on the sidelines is this continued volatility that we are seeing on the capital markets side. And from a pure sourcing perspective, as you can see from the numbers that we\u2019ve posted, from a \u2013 the next 4 to 5-month pipeline perspective, I can continue to share with you that the momentum is there. It is incredibly positive. And what sort of keeps us sort of hedging is what\u2019s going to happen in the last 4 to 5 months if this continued volatility remains. We are very comfortable with the $5 billion number, and it\u2019s actually, we say, above $5 billion. And I think we can also go so far as to say that not all of that $1.7 billion, which we expect to close in the fourth quarter, was contemplated when we came out with the numbers that we did.\nNicholas Joseph: Thank you.\nSumit Roy: Sure. Thanks, Nick.\nChristie Kelly: Nick, I just wanted to follow-up, too, to make sure that I captured the breadth of your question. I also wanted to just share that as we\u2019ve talked about, that we use foreign debt to serve as a natural hedge on our foreign assets. And probably the only other thing you\u2019d be interested in is we also have FX forwards in place to hedge some of our foreign earnings.\nOperator: Okay, alright. Next, we will go to Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Your line is now open.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Can you give us an update on the VEREIT merger and how the G&A synergies are trending so far?\nSumit Roy: Sure. I\u2019ll start off. And then Christie, if you wouldn\u2019t mind just addressing the run rate on the synergies. With regards to the integration itself, I think it has gone according to plan. I would even go so far as to say it\u2019s ahead of plan. The two companies are integrated from an organizational perspective. The personnel have integrated into their various teams. Common procedures and processes and controls have been adopted. And we are clearly seeing that on the acquisition front, on the asset management front and the property management front, etcetera. So I think organizationally, we are where we were hoping to be. In terms of synergies, I\u2019ll let Christie take that question.\nChristie Kelly: Thanks, Sumit. So we had shared during the transaction that we were focused on executing $45 million to $55 million in synergies. And from the perspective of where we are right now, we\u2019re tracking towards the higher end of that range and well ahead of plan.\nMichael Goldsmith: That\u2019s helpful. And as a follow-up, more focused on Europe. Given what\u2019s transpiring there, can you provide an update on the health of the investment landscape in Europe broadly and then maybe touch on some of the specific regions? And then within that, your European portfolio is more concentrated in certain retailers. So how do you \u2013 over time, how do you look to diversify that to kind of spread \u2013 to spread out the exposure? Thank you.\nSumit Roy: Sure, Michael. Very good questions. Look, I think by design, we had chosen to enter into Western Europe. And we, by design, chose the UK primarily because of the ease of affordability of our cost of capital and processes and tax regime, etcetera, etcetera. You\u2019re absolutely right that we have chosen to continue to work with some very large operators, and that investment pipeline has continued to be a major source of our growth of what is today a $5 billion portfolio. The good news here is the operators that we are partnering with they are very, very large. And so there is a tremendous amount of runway for us to continue to do the consolidation. I think there was an element of your question that also touched on, given what is happening in Eastern Europe, how are we impacted? How are our operators impacted? What I can share with you is, as of right now, all of the operators that we have done business with in Europe, none of them have operations today. None of them have operations in Russia, Ukraine or any of the adjacent countries that are potentially being impacted by what\u2019s playing out in Eastern Europe. The only operator ironically that does have some element of exposure to Russia is actually Couche-Tard that has about 36 assets, which is less than 1% of their overall footprint \u2013 global footprint that is based in Russia. And outside of that, none of our operators today have operations in either of those impacted countries. So we have a tremendous amount of pipeline. We have a fair amount of runway to not only continue to grow with the operators that we\u2019ve established, but also as we branch out into new countries with other dominant operators in those countries, and some of which, as you can tell, Carrefour was a brand new name for us, and we did the sale-leaseback in Spain. We have continued to grow that name. And as we continue to add more and more countries, and even within countries, as we get more comfortable with the landscape and operators, you\u2019ll start to see a few other very large names get added to our client registry, so, so far, so good. And by design, we\u2019ve stayed on the western side of Europe. And those businesses continue to do well.\nOperator: Okay, alright. We will go to our next question, Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Your line is open.\nHaendel St. Juste: Hey, I guess, it\u2019s good afternoon out there, as well. \nChristie Kelly: Hi, there, Haendel.\nHaendel St. Juste: Hi, there. So you guys sold $122 million in the first quarter, you said mostly VEREIT assets. But I guess I\u2019m curious how much more is there left to sell in that platform that you\u2019ve identified? And I guess why were there so many vacant properties there to lease? Thanks.\nSumit Roy: Yes. It\u2019s about \u2013 so I\u2019ll answer your last question first, Haendel. There is about 156 assets that are vacant in our portfolio close to 11,500 assets. So it\u2019s not significant, as you can tell which is clearly why we have 98.6% occupancy. Look, for us, it is \u2013 this quarter happened to be one where of all the assets sold, about 97%, 98% \u2013 I believe it was $118 million $119 million of the $122 million were vacant asset sales. And even that number was largely dominated by two industrial assets that we sold vacant where we were able to strike very good total return profiles. This is going to continue to ebb and flow. There\u2019ll be quarters where we have some occupied assets that we have opportunistically decided to sell. And clearly, selling vacant assets is very much part and parcel of our business. And when we do sell vacant assets, we give you a total return profile on what is the unlevered return that we were able to achieve, which this first quarter was north of 9% on an unlevered basis. So these are assets that we may have held for 10, 12, 15 years, have generated a fair amount of cash flow. And even when sold vacant, especially in inflationary environments, it allows us to create and capture the kind of returns that we are posting. But the point I want to make and I want to leave with you, Haendel, is selling vacant assets is absolutely part of our business. We go through an asset management analysis where we try to figure out what is the most economic \u2013 what is the most positive outcome in terms of the economics of selling the asset, re-leasing the asset, repositioning the asset or entering into a negotiation with the existing client. And once we sort of go through that, we make the determination to go down one of these paths. And that\u2019s what drives our thinking in terms of how we decide whether to sell vacant assets or occupied assets. And that will continue to be the mantra that dictates our asset management strategy going forward.\nHaendel St. Juste: Got it. Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Maybe some comments on business \u2013 thinking of business overall, I understand you\u2019re not in a position of having to sell assets, but just curious if you\u2019re maybe thinking a bit differently here, maybe selling a bit more in light of the movement in rates?\nSumit Roy: So Haendel, do you think what we\u2019re experiencing today is going to continue on? Because, yes, if what we have experienced in the market more recently sort of creates this disconnect between private market valuations and public market valuations, and obviously, selling assets becomes very much part and parcel of our strategy. Truth be told, Haendel, we\u2019ve never, outside of those very small pockets of time, i.e., when the pandemic first started, where we had a few weeks where there was a dislocation. For a sustained period, we\u2019ve never encountered a scenario where asset prices were being valued in the private market higher than what our public market valuation indicated. But if that were to play out, hypothetically speaking, we would not be averse to raising capital, if needed, through asset sales. This is, again, I think, will accrue to our benefit given the quality of assets that we have being able to assemble especially over the last 10 years, and more specifically, over the last 3 to 4 years. So that continues to remain a strategy but one that we hope doesn\u2019t play out because I think the only scenario where I can see that happening is a macro environment where things are incredibly uncertain. And I hope that, that doesn\u2019t play out that way. But look, it\u2019s absolutely a theoretical strategy that we can lean on if needed.\nHaendel St. Juste: Got it. Got it. One more on the guidance, maybe for Christie, you reversed the $10 million of movie-theater-related reserves. I\u2019m curious what\u2019s left that opportunity bucket here today and what\u2019s contemplated in the guide. And maybe a question on the lower end of guidance, run-rate FFO was closer to $0.95. You didn\u2019t raise the lower end. Maybe help us square that a bit? Thanks.\nChristie Kelly: Yes. I think certainly, Haendel, I mean, in terms of the overall reserves that we have remaining from the COVID time period, it\u2019s approximately $30 million. And the majority of those deferral arrangements are going to be in effect as of July. And so in accordance with our guidelines and the like, we will be ensuring over the next 6 months towards the end of the year that we\u2019re collecting in accordance with our deferral arrangements. And so as it relates to guidance, we really don\u2019t have anything else factored in of note into the midpoint of our guidance.\nHaendel St. Juste: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Okay, we will move to our next question. Caitlin Burrows with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nCaitlin Burrows: Yes. Great. Maybe on the tenant side, Sumit, earlier, you referenced it briefly, but obviously, you have a lot of individual tenants. What\u2019s your impression on how they are doing? To what extent they can pass along inflation impacts to their customers? And how that ultimately impacts their ability to pay rent?\nSumit Roy: Yes. Look, it is certainly a story that is playing out very differently for those that are well-capitalized businesses versus those that tend to be smaller operators in this high inflationary environment. We had Neil\u2019s team, the research team, do an analysis on our top 150 clients. And they represent about 85% of our rent. And we were like very focused on what is going to happen to their balance sheet, their ability to pay in the event that interest rates were to rise 300 basis points from where it is currently. And, this is a big and, they didn\u2019t have the ability to pass through any of those increased costs that they were bearing on to their customers, which is a highly unlikely scenario, but we were trying to figure out what would happen in that particular scenario for us. And it was 11 of these operators of the 150 representing less than 5% of our rent where the coverages fell below 1x. So, we feel like \u2013 again, by design, we have created a client registry that\u2019s predominantly made up of very well capitalized operators. But those one-off operators \u2013 and Caitlin you are right, we have 1,000 different clients. So, we certainly have a few one-off operators that tend to be smaller operators. It is going to be more difficult for them to be able to absorb this and their inability to pass through their costs. But we have had a few general merchandising stores. We have had a few folks who are going to \u2013 who have actually talked about increasing EBIT margins because of their ability to pass-through a lot of these costs. And predominantly, our client registries made up of those types of folks. So, yes, hypothetically, Caitlin, the smaller operators will suffer in this environment and may not make it. But thankfully, we don\u2019t have too much exposure to that, and it is very small in terms of percentage of our overall rent.\nCaitlin Burrows: Great. Thanks. And then maybe just as a follow-up to an earlier question regarding that $45 million to $55 million of VEREIT-related G&A synergies. Christie, could you just clarify to what extent Realty Income is already at a good run rate, or how much further there is to go when you think I will get there, just trying to think of the cadence and timing there?\nChristie Kelly: Yes. I think, Caitlin, we are already over the midpoint of our guidance for the first year of execution. And to that point, we probably have 10% to 15% more to go. There is essentially some lag associated with timing that will also spill into 2023, but we have made excellent progress as a team.\nCaitlin Burrows: Thanks.\nChristie Kelly: Thanks Caitlin.\nOperator: Next we will go to Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nRonald Kamdem: Yes. A couple of quick ones for me. Just going back on sort of the gaming acquisition, I think you have mentioned in the opening comments still on track. Can you remind us what else sort of needs to be done before that\u2019s done and dusted? And the follow-up is just, have you sort of gotten \u2013 received more interest in sort of the gaming side? And is that an opportunity? Thanks.\nSumit Roy: Hi Ron. Yes. So, the biggest element to closing this transaction is the licensing process, and we are well in the midst of going through that process. We have submitted our application. It is being reviewed by the Massachusetts Gaming Group. And we are very hopeful that by fourth quarter, we will be in a position to close this transaction. But that really is the one outstanding element to be able to close this transaction, but so far so good. Everything that we are hearing, everything that we have received in terms of MGC\u2019s response to our initial application has been quite positive. So, we feel pretty good about that. In terms of the industry itself, no surprise, we are getting a lot of inbounds from potential sale-leaseback opportunities. And the team is reviewing them one at a time. But our thesis around this particular space remains the same. We want to partner with the best-in-class operators and find assets that are truly one-of-a-kind, just like we did with the Boston asset. And if at a very high level, those criterias are met, we will absolutely continue to increase our exposure to this particular sector.\nRonald Kamdem: Great. And if I could just sneak in one more. Just earlier in the call, you made some comments about sort of the top 150 tenants in the portfolio and 85% of rents. And when I think about aspirations of doing these larger sale-leaseback opportunities, just you take a step back, how many of those clients potentially do you think are \u2013 would be interested this would be the right solution for them versus it sort of have to be new relationships, new tenants for sort of these larger sale-leaseback deals in the future? Thank you.\nSumit Roy: Sure. So Ron, I mean you have seen us grow our existing relationships to areas where they start to dominate our shareholder registry. So, for instance, I will give you a perfect example. We did the first sale-leaseback with Dollar General. This was, I believe in 2015- 2016 timeframe, and it was maybe $130 million, $140 million sale-leaseback. We subsequently continued to grow our opportunity with Dollar General through multiple sale-leasebacks. It\u2019s a similar story with 7-Eleven. A lot of these clients that you see in our top 20 have grown over multiple years and they continue to have ambitious growth profile. So, that channel of growth remains for us. Then we also have the ability to do first-time sale-leasebacks in a large way with clients like Wynn. These are asset classes that tend to be very large. But again, given that we are about a $57 billion, $58 billion company today, it is going to register as a 3.5% client. And clearly, we have said this very openly that in the event, Wynn decides to continue to execute and grow their footprint beyond the two locations that they currently have, we would love to continue to partner with them. And so this is a function of being able to do first time sale-leasebacks in a big way. And now that we are of the size that we are, our ability to absorb those \u2013 and when I say big, I mean $1 billion sale-leaseback, even multiple billion dollar sale-leasebacks that has grown over the last few years and especially post the VEREIT merger.\nRonald Kamdem: Helpful. Thank you.\nSumit Roy: Sure.\nOperator: Next we will go to Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Yes. Hey everyone. Sumit, just wanted to follow-up on your comment that cap rates tend to lag, interest rate moves by six months. So, I guess why not maybe slow down acquisitions a bit and kind of weight maybe towards the back half of the year to kind of get that better cap rate?\nSumit Roy: Yes. Hi Josh. I wish our business was a spigot where you could switch it off and turn it back on at a moment\u2019s notice. Unfortunately, our business doesn\u2019t work quite like that. When you think about how we source opportunities and how we create a pipeline of opportunities and what is the timing that it takes from making a decision to pursuing a particular transaction and then closing it, it could take anywhere between four months to six months from start to finish. So, unless you have a crystal ball, it is very, very difficult to be able to sort of do exactly what you suggested, which would have been perfect, if we could. The other thing I would tell you is there is a lag even in our cost of capital. When you have volatile situations like this, but you are seeing opportunities that seem very well priced on a pure real estate underwriting in terms of replacement costs, in terms of price per pound, and you think about the leases that we are able to capture with the clients that are engaging in these types of transactions, you obviously build into your underwriting a particular buffer. And hopefully, we have been conservative enough where we are still being able to capture positive healthy spreads to our cost of capital while continuing to enhance the \u2013 our basic AFFO per share growth as well as our client registry with new relationships. So, it\u2019s very difficult. We had a different mindset over the next six months to nine months, which said, hey, the world is going to fall apart. We absolutely will pull in our horns just like we did in that very first quarter right after the \u2013 it was actually the second quarter of 2020, when the pandemic hit where we slowed down our ability to sort of continue looking at transactions, and truth be told, even the market there, the transaction market sort of went silent for a bit, just because people are very unsure of how things are going to play out. But that I have already shared with you is not the case. Sourcing remains very healthy. And we feel like even with the appropriate flexing of our own cost of capital, we are able to grow our business in a manner that is very much aligned with our acquisition strategy. But Josh, I will be very honest, if our views change, we will stop continuing to build the pipeline. But that is not the case right now.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. That\u2019s fair. And then maybe another follow-up about expanding into other countries in Europe, what is it that get you comfortable to expand outside the UK and Spain?\nSumit Roy: The right opportunities. There are already a set of countries that we have preapproved, so to speak, internally and have shared with our Board that there are countries that we would like to be able to grow in the event the right opportunities come along. We have identified the businesses that we would like to do business with. We have identified the clients. We have identified the fact that these are businesses that will continue to thrive even in cycles like the one that we are experiencing. And if those boxes are checked and we are able to sort of strike the right balance in terms of spreads, etcetera, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to allow us to continue to expand our geographic footprint in Western Europe.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Great. Thanks guys.\nSumit Roy: Thank you, Josh.\nOperator: Next we will go to John Massocca with Ladenburg Thalmann. Your line is open.\nJohn Massocca: Good afternoon.\nChristie Kelly: Hi John.\nJohn Massocca: So, I think historically, you have kind of looked at long-term same-store growth. I understand you have a target for guidance this year. But long-term same-store growth is being right around 1%. And some of the things you are seeing in terms of maybe rent on renewals and just the effects of increasing prices across the real estate world, in general, increase that outlook, I mean is that enough to move the needle, or is it just \u2013 it\u2019s obviously going to primarily be the rent bumps you have in place. But I mean can that be big enough given the lease expiration schedule to move that up maybe noticeably?\nSumit Roy: Well, John, that\u2019s what makes us different, right. I mean if you look at our world, vis-\u00e0-vis our peers, we are at right around 8 years, 8.5 years. And if you look at our lease maturity schedule and I think I said this during my prepared remarks that 12% of our leases are going to renew over the next 2.5 years. And so it does \u2013 if we can keep this momentum, I don\u2019t know if it will be 106%, but the other thing I would say about that 106% is it\u2019s effectively net increases. And so if we can keep it in that ZIP code, that will become a major growth driver for our business, and it will become an internal growth driver of our business, especially if we continue down this highly inflationary environment. The other good news is if you think about our international expansion, a lot of those leases tend to be CPI-adjusted leases. And they don\u2019t tend to have this collar \u2013 a ceiling and a floor that we experience here, but it\u2019s a relative comment. I would say the vast majority of CPI leases that we have here in the U.S. tend to have a collar. And I would say maybe one-third to even 40% of the leases in the international markets tend to be \u2013 basically do not have a collar around it, and they are very much tied to CPI growth. And so I think all of that will start to percolate through our portfolio and will help us drive more internal growth than what we have historically experienced in our business. And we think of this as an opportunity, and we have been talking about asset management now for about 5 years, 6 years in anticipation of what we are now starting to experience as a company. And so look, we think we are very positively set up to take advantage of this situation. And it then helps us alleviate some of the pressure of just growing through external measures, which of course, is also something that the team is doing very well.\nJohn Massocca: And then on the external growth side of things, obviously, you are a bigger company, so you would expect this to grow. But the development pipeline seems to kind of keep taking legs up. I mean is there something specific driving that?\nSumit Roy: Yes. It\u2019s by design, John. We want development to continue to tick up because we do get more spread doing development. And this allows us to continue to be the one-stop solution that our clients are looking for. And just to be super clear, we are talking about build-to-suit on 99% of our development. So, I mean\u2026\nJohn Massocca: Are you talking about client demand, or is that something just you haven\u2019t been exploiting that market maybe 3 years ago the same way you are today?\nSumit Roy: John, they are build-to-suit. So, by definition, they are being driven by our clients coming to us or coming to a developer and saying we would like to have you develop here in this particular location because we would like to enter into a long-term lease. And we have either relationships directly with our clients who then ask us to work with the developer or with some developers who have asked us to become their capital source as a permanent takeout. And that is what\u2019s allowing us to continue to enhance our development pipeline. So, this is absolutely being driven by the clients, not by us. This was just a hole in our overall strategy that we are now addressing in a meaningful way.\nJohn Massocca: Okay. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you very much.\nSumit Roy: Thanks John.\nOperator: Next we will go to Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nLinda Tsai: Yes. Hi. In terms of driving higher internal growth that you just mentioned, is there a range you would like to target or move towards over time?\nSumit Roy: 10%. Linda, I am not trying to be flippant, but look, our intention is to try to drive that up. Some of it will naturally come with the expansion in asset types. There are certain asset types that lend themselves to higher organic growth. That was part of the attraction that we had with investing in industrial assets, and we saw that. And some of these other asset types, just like I said, do have a higher profile than the 1% that we have traditionally been able to get in the space that we had targeted historically. So, could I see that tick up, that\u2019s the hope with more international acquisition, with more industrial, with more development where we can create more bespoke leases. If we can get that 1% to 1.5% to 2%, that would be a major uplift and a source of internal growth. But that\u2019s not going to happen overnight. It\u2019s going to take us time, and it\u2019s going to take intentionality, which we certainly have.\nLinda Tsai: Thanks. And then just to follow-up, any general update on the theater business? To the extent you have seen more recovery, would you look to sell some of these assets?\nSumit Roy: We are not quite there where we would want to sell our theater portfolio, Linda. In fact, all indications have been all trend lines have indicated that the theater business is getting back to a strong footing despite all of the noise that we hear about the theater business and PBOD [ph] and all of that. In fact, I was looking at some numbers in the first quarter of 2022. We are back to about 75% of 2019 levels. And so clearly, this is a business that is largely driven by content. We are also very encouraged by the pipeline of big-tent movies that are going to be released over the next two months to three months. We are very hopeful that, that will translate to more attendance. And the good news is a couple of these large operators like Regal and AMC are cash flowing positive on the assets that we own. So, I think all of that leads us to believe that this industry as we had hoped and our hypothesis was is sort of on demand. Having said all of that, we also did a fair amount of downside scenario analysis where we looked at some of these locations and we feel like we have the ability, the capital, the relationships to reposition these assets in the event that the business doesn\u2019t play out. I think the wrong economic decision today would be to sell some of these assets at what I would consider to be fire sale prices. And again, just to remind everyone, 82% of our portfolio is in the top two quartiles of performance for both these operators. So, we feel very good about the theater business, but more specifically about the portfolio that we own. And so the decision to sell, though a theoretical one and has been considered, is one that we are not in a position to execute on given some of what I just said.\nLinda Tsai: Thank you.\nSumit Roy: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer portion of Realty Income\u2019s conference call. I will now turn the call over to Sumit Roy for any concluding remarks.\nSumit Roy: Thank you all for joining us, and we look forward to speaking at the upcoming NAREIT conference. Thank you all. Bye-bye.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Christie Kelly",
            "content": "Thank you, Sumit. During the first quarter, our business generated AFFO per share of $0.98 supported by a strong acquisition pace and a healthy portfolio. As Sumit mentioned, during the quarter, we recognized a $9.4 million reversal of non-straight line rental revenue reserves. This was primarily driven by the $7.7 million reversal of our outstanding reserves related to AMC, reflecting the recovery from the pandemic. Given the performance of our One Team, the health of our portfolio and progress achieved during the first quarter of 2022, we reaffirm our previously announced 2022 AFFO per share guidance of $3.84 to $3.97, representing 8.8% annual growth at the midpoint. From a leverage standpoint, we ended the quarter with a net debt to annualized adjusted EBITDAR of 5.4x in line with our target leverage ratios. And our near-term debt maturities remain minimal with a well-staggered predominantly fixed rate debt maturity schedule and no corporate bond maturities until 2024. As Sumit mentioned in his opening remarks, our modest debt maturity schedule through the end of next year limits our refinancing risk in a raising rate environment. Our size and scale provide us access to attractively price debt across several markets. For example, in January, we issued \u00a3500 million in sterling-denominated senior unsecured notes, pricing 5-year and 20-year notes at a blended all-in yield of 2.28% with a weighted average term of 12.5 years. During the quarter, we issued over $660 million of equity primarily through our ATM program. And subsequent to the quarter end, we entered into a definitive agreement for the private placement of a \u00a3600 million sterling-denominated offering of senior unsecured notes, pricing 8-year, 10-year and 15-year notes at a weighted average fixed rate of 3.22%, with a weighted average tenor of approximately 10.5 years. We greatly appreciate the support from the investors who have participated in our capital markets transactions. Finally, just last week, we announced the recast and upsizing of our credit facility, which now includes a $4.25 billion multicurrency revolving line of credit with an initial maturity in June 2026 and two 6-month extension options as well as a $1 billion accordion feature. At our current credit rating, the new revolving line of credit provides a borrowing rate of adjusted SOFR plus 72.5 basis points as compared to our previous credit facility of LIBOR plus 77.5 basis points. In total, 25 lenders participated in our recast and we greatly appreciate the support of our relationship banks, many of whom have supported us for decades and have been integral towards our growth. We have been most active during the last 12 months within corporate finance and capital markets. I'd like to make special mention of Jonathan Pong and his team who have worked tirelessly to bring our corporate financing strategies and capital markets execution together with our partners to fruition on behalf of all whom we serve. Realty Income was founded on the principles of income generation and capital preservation. We remain committed to delivering monthly dividends that increase over time as part of a consistently attractive total shareholder return proposition. In March, we celebrated the payment of our 620th monthly dividend by virtually bringing the New York Stock Exchange closing bell. At Realty Income, the dividend is sacrosanct and we are proud to be one of only three REITs in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index for having raised our dividend for at least 25 consecutive years. And the value of our business is largely tied to current income as a recurring cash flow vehicle. As a result, the value proposition of owning Realty Income is comparatively more attractive during inflationary periods versus those whose value is tied to growth in future years. And now, I would like to pass the call back to Sumit. Hi, Brad. Hi, Greg. Yes. Thanks for that, Greg. Yes, we are very excited about the renewal of our $4.25 billion credit facility. The team just did a great job, and we've got great support from a lineup of banks. In terms of indicative pricing right now, 10-year U.S. treasuries, we just received this morning above 4%, call it, 4.2%, 4.3%. When we look at sterling, we're probably in 3.7% range. And then euro-related debt, high 2s, 2.8% to 3%. And as you know, part of our strategy is to really take advantage of the European execution from a liability perspective. And so as part of our capital strategy, we'd be looking to execute in sterling. And depending on how things pan out throughout the rest of the year, potentially execute from a euro perspective as well. I think what you can expect from us, Greg, is to just really be consistent as we executed, for example, in April with the private placement of approximately $800 million. We have a delayed draw on that. So the paydown is in June. And as you mentioned, we've got our revolver, and we also have our commercial paper program that is even further pricing inside the revolver. So we've got a lot of opportunity here in front of us to fund our acquisition volume and do so within the range of guidance. Thanks, Greg. Hi, Nick. Yes. So from a hedging perspective, we have hedges in place that we've executed both from an interest rate perspective. The team executed those back in the 2020 time period in June. And as you can imagine, we're in the money. And it was very well designed as it relates to the current environment. Nick, I just wanted to follow-up, too, to make sure that I captured the breadth of your question. I also wanted to just share that as we've talked about, that we use foreign debt to serve as a natural hedge on our foreign assets. And probably the only other thing you'd be interested in is we also have FX forwards in place to hedge some of our foreign earnings. Thanks, Sumit. So we had shared during the transaction that we were focused on executing $45 million to $55 million in synergies. And from the perspective of where we are right now, we're tracking towards the higher end of that range and well ahead of plan. Hi, there, Haendel. Yes. I think certainly, Haendel, I mean, in terms of the overall reserves that we have remaining from the COVID time period, it's approximately $30 million. And the majority of those deferral arrangements are going to be in effect as of July. And so in accordance with our guidelines and the like, we will be ensuring over the next 6 months towards the end of the year that we're collecting in accordance with our deferral arrangements. And so as it relates to guidance, we really don't have anything else factored in of note into the midpoint of our guidance. Yes. I think, Caitlin, we are already over the midpoint of our guidance for the first year of execution. And to that point, we probably have 10% to 15% more to go. There is essentially some lag associated with timing that will also spill into 2023, but we have made excellent progress as a team. Thanks Caitlin. Hi John."

            "content": "Thanks, Julie. Welcome everyone. 2022 is off to a strong start, and we are continuing to build momentum in our business. I want to express my deep appreciation of our One Team whose dedication and collaboration showcased the strength of our team through a timely closing of the first quarter, while integrating new processes and systems following the close of the VEREIT merger last November. All integration efforts are progressing and we remain committed to delivering continued scalability. We continue to make progress on our ESG initiatives and partnerships with our clients. In April, we published our second annual sustainability report, which details our commitments, goals and progress on our ESG efforts. I welcome all Realty Income stakeholders to share in our dedication to build sustainable relationships for the benefit of those we serve and encourage everyone listening to read through our 2021 sustainability report, which can be found in the Corporate Responsibility page of our website. Looking at macro trends, inflation persists as an important topic on the minds of many stakeholders and I want to emphasize that we believe our business is by design well-positioned to drive value in this climate. Our business model is one that generates significant recurring revenue that flows through to the bottom line. As a triple net lease REIT, our business is insulated from inflation. Our clients are responsible for covering taxes, insurance and other operating expenses. And as prices increase, many of our clients pass the incremental cost burden on to their consumers or suppliers. The efficiency of our model is reflected in our adjusted EBITDA margin, which is routinely around 94%. Maintaining a conservative capital structure has been a key tenet of our business since our founding and having a well-staggered fixed rate debt maturity schedule with no corporate bond maturities until 2024 limits on debt refinancing risk in a rising rate environment. In summary, we believe the appeal of our consistent and predictable stream of cash flows is amplified during periods of volatility like we find ourselves in today. To that end, we look at the last period in which the Federal Reserve increased interest rates from December 2015 through 2018 as a helpful case study. During this period, Realty Income's total return outperformed the S&P 500 and the MSCI U.S. REIT Index both in year 1 of the rate hike cycle and throughout the 3-year duration of that cycle. And during the Great Recession, Realty Income exhibited less operational and financial volatility as compared to many other S&P 500 REITs that carry A credit ratings. From an organic growth standpoint, our asset management team continues to report impressive recapture rates. This quarter, we recaptured over 106% of rental revenue on expiring leases. Given our lease expiration schedule and proven rent recapture track record, we believe we are well-positioned to manage through an inflationary environment. Through 2024, nearly 12% of our portfolio annualized contractual rent is set to expire. And in this regard, inflation could serve as a tailwind to our business as rents and costs to build rise. On the acquisition front, our transaction flow remains strong. Certain categories of the market, has seen discernible increase in cap rates, which we believe should accrue to our advantage as a net acquirer. Historically, we have observed that when interest rates increase, cap rates are just following a lag period of 6 to 12 months. Much of this cap rate expansion can be attributed to levered buyers who have relied upon record low debt pricing to underwrite their returns. Given the current yield environment, we are in a comparatively strong position given our financing strategy. And as such, we would expect our competitive standing to strengthen further. Now, turning to the results for the quarter, our size and scale, in conjunction with strong relationships we have across the marketplace, continue to provide benefits through robust sourcing and acquisition volumes. This quarter, we sourced over $34 billion of acquisition opportunities. And approximately 40% of this amount was sourced from international markets. Our total property level acquisitions for the quarter, was approximately $1.6 billion. Approximately half of our volume in the first quarter was the result of international investments, bringing our total international portfolio to approximately $5 billion of invested capital. As we announced in February, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire the Encore Boston Harbor Resort and Casino leased to Wynn Resorts under a 30-year triple net lease with favorable annual rent increases. The $1.7 billion transaction includes more than 3.1 million square feet of high-quality real estate less than 5 miles from Downtown Boston. Pending regulatory procedures, we continue to anticipate this transaction closing during the fourth quarter of 2022. We believe the market is efficient. And while cap rates have stabilized, significant competition remains with the high-quality assets we pursue. Our average initial cash cap rate for the quarter was 5.6%, which reflects the quality of locations and clients we are adding to our portfolio. As a reminder, we report our cap rates on a cash basis. We estimate the difference between cash and straight line cap rates to be approximately an additional 70 basis points in the first quarter. The weighted average remaining lease term of the assets added to our portfolio during the quarter was 12.3 years and the top industry invested during the quarter was grocery stores. We continue to have access to attractively priced capital, which has allowed us to maintain healthy spreads on our investments even as interest rates rise. We are pleased with the continued strength of our core operations. We ended the quarter with our portfolio at 98.6% occupancy based on property count. The weighted average remaining lease term of our overall portfolio is approximately 8.9 years, which as I mentioned in my opening remarks, we see as an advantage. As leases roll, we continue to favorably recapture rent as a result of diligent underwriting and the inherent quality of our real estate enhanced by the proactive efforts of our experienced asset management team. This quarter, we re-leased 119 leases, recapturing 106.2% of expiring rent. And since our public listing in 1994, we have executed 4,260 re-leases or sales on expiring leases, recapturing over 101% of rent on those re-leased contracts. We continue to report our quarterly recapture rates, because we believe this is one of the most objective ways to measure underlying portfolio quality in the net lease industry. During the quarter, we sold 34 properties, generating net proceeds of approximately $122 million. Approximately, 84% of the sales volume during the quarter related to former VEREIT properties that were sold rated. And our portfolio delivered healthy same-store rent growth increasing 4.1% during the quarter. This was largely attributed to the reversal of $9.4 million of rental revenue reserves during the quarter within the same store pool compared to a reserve of $8 million recognized for the same pool during the year ago period. Excluding the impact of reserves in both periods, we estimate that our same-store rent growth would have been approximately 1.2%. At this time, I will pass it over to Christie who will further discuss results from the quarter. Thank you, Christie. Our business continues to perform and we are well-positioned to build on our momentum throughout 2022 and beyond. These are interesting times and I remain encouraged by our One Team's creativity and work effort. We remain steadfast in our pursuit of providing our stakeholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns over the long-term. Thank you again to our team and partners for helping us deliver these results and to our stakeholders for their continued support. With that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Brad. Good question. I think the most obvious difference in cap rates \u2013 increasing cap rates we see is in the industrial sector and more so here in the U.S. than in the international markets. I would say if I was asked to quantify what this change is in terms of what we were seeing in the third and fourth quarter of last year to what we started to see in the first quarter and beyond of this year, I would say it's in the tune of 25 to 50 basis points of increase in cap rates on the industrial sector. We are also starting to see on the retail side some of the transactions that were struck again in the fourth quarter of last year with potential levered buyers coming back. And certainty of close is taking on paramount importance with regards to the sellers and they are coming back at slightly higher cap rates. We see this more on the larger dollar retail acquisition opportunities, not so much on the QSR and smaller opportunities. But we are starting to see movement higher on the retail side, but it is not as dominant and it's not as widespread as we see it on the industrial side. Yes. I think part of it is that sale leaseback may potentially be a better avenue to raise capital and monetize their real estate, but I think part of it is also the maturation of the sale leaseback market, especially here in the U.S. We are starting to see first time operators engaging in sale leaseback conversations and a lot of it is not necessarily being generated by activist investors coming into play. A lot of it is organic. This is becoming part of their balance sheet management strategy going forward. And some of these are much larger than what we have typically seen in years past. And when I say that, I mean with $1 billion in front rather than $1 million. And to us, it is a function of the maturation of the sale leaseback market and of course, also what is happening on the CMBS and secured debt markets today. Greg, you maybe on mute. Nick, sorry, you cut off. Could you repeat that last question, please? Yes, I can. Go ahead. Yes. So Nick, if you recall, when we first came out with our guidance, this was in late October, I think, of last year, which was very unusual for us, and a lot of what was driving that thinking then was making sure that people were able to underwrite what this merger was going to mean for the pro forma company. And we had come out with a number of $5 billion, approximately $5 billion. We haven't changed that. And like you've said, we've obviously made the announcement subsequent to that initial guidance of a $1.7 billion transaction. And what I can share with you, Nick, is not all of that $1.7 billion was contemplated when we had first come out with the $5 billion. In fact, we weren't even sure we had a deal at that time. So could that $5 billion go up? Yes. But what I \u2013 what keeps us a little bit on the sidelines is this continued volatility that we are seeing on the capital markets side. And from a pure sourcing perspective, as you can see from the numbers that we've posted, from a \u2013 the next 4 to 5-month pipeline perspective, I can continue to share with you that the momentum is there. It is incredibly positive. And what sort of keeps us sort of hedging is what's going to happen in the last 4 to 5 months if this continued volatility remains. We are very comfortable with the $5 billion number, and it's actually, we say, above $5 billion. And I think we can also go so far as to say that not all of that $1.7 billion, which we expect to close in the fourth quarter, was contemplated when we came out with the numbers that we did. Sure. Thanks, Nick. Sure. I'll start off. And then Christie, if you wouldn't mind just addressing the run rate on the synergies. With regards to the integration itself, I think it has gone according to plan. I would even go so far as to say it's ahead of plan. The two companies are integrated from an organizational perspective. The personnel have integrated into their various teams. Common procedures and processes and controls have been adopted. And we are clearly seeing that on the acquisition front, on the asset management front and the property management front, etcetera. So I think organizationally, we are where we were hoping to be. In terms of synergies, I'll let Christie take that question. Sure, Michael. Very good questions. Look, I think by design, we had chosen to enter into Western Europe. And we, by design, chose the UK primarily because of the ease of affordability of our cost of capital and processes and tax regime, etcetera, etcetera. You're absolutely right that we have chosen to continue to work with some very large operators, and that investment pipeline has continued to be a major source of our growth of what is today a $5 billion portfolio. The good news here is the operators that we are partnering with they are very, very large. And so there is a tremendous amount of runway for us to continue to do the consolidation. I think there was an element of your question that also touched on, given what is happening in Eastern Europe, how are we impacted? How are our operators impacted? What I can share with you is, as of right now, all of the operators that we have done business with in Europe, none of them have operations today. None of them have operations in Russia, Ukraine or any of the adjacent countries that are potentially being impacted by what's playing out in Eastern Europe. The only operator ironically that does have some element of exposure to Russia is actually Couche-Tard that has about 36 assets, which is less than 1% of their overall footprint \u2013 global footprint that is based in Russia. And outside of that, none of our operators today have operations in either of those impacted countries. So we have a tremendous amount of pipeline. We have a fair amount of runway to not only continue to grow with the operators that we've established, but also as we branch out into new countries with other dominant operators in those countries, and some of which, as you can tell, Carrefour was a brand new name for us, and we did the sale-leaseback in Spain. We have continued to grow that name. And as we continue to add more and more countries, and even within countries, as we get more comfortable with the landscape and operators, you'll start to see a few other very large names get added to our client registry, so, so far, so good. And by design, we've stayed on the western side of Europe. And those businesses continue to do well. Yes. It's about \u2013 so I'll answer your last question first, Haendel. There is about 156 assets that are vacant in our portfolio close to 11,500 assets. So it's not significant, as you can tell which is clearly why we have 98.6% occupancy. Look, for us, it is \u2013 this quarter happened to be one where of all the assets sold, about 97%, 98% \u2013 I believe it was $118 million $119 million of the $122 million were vacant asset sales. And even that number was largely dominated by two industrial assets that we sold vacant where we were able to strike very good total return profiles. This is going to continue to ebb and flow. There'll be quarters where we have some occupied assets that we have opportunistically decided to sell. And clearly, selling vacant assets is very much part and parcel of our business. And when we do sell vacant assets, we give you a total return profile on what is the unlevered return that we were able to achieve, which this first quarter was north of 9% on an unlevered basis. So these are assets that we may have held for 10, 12, 15 years, have generated a fair amount of cash flow. And even when sold vacant, especially in inflationary environments, it allows us to create and capture the kind of returns that we are posting. But the point I want to make and I want to leave with you, Haendel, is selling vacant assets is absolutely part of our business. We go through an asset management analysis where we try to figure out what is the most economic \u2013 what is the most positive outcome in terms of the economics of selling the asset, re-leasing the asset, repositioning the asset or entering into a negotiation with the existing client. And once we sort of go through that, we make the determination to go down one of these paths. And that's what drives our thinking in terms of how we decide whether to sell vacant assets or occupied assets. And that will continue to be the mantra that dictates our asset management strategy going forward. So Haendel, do you think what we're experiencing today is going to continue on? Because, yes, if what we have experienced in the market more recently sort of creates this disconnect between private market valuations and public market valuations, and obviously, selling assets becomes very much part and parcel of our strategy. Truth be told, Haendel, we've never, outside of those very small pockets of time, i.e., when the pandemic first started, where we had a few weeks where there was a dislocation. For a sustained period, we've never encountered a scenario where asset prices were being valued in the private market higher than what our public market valuation indicated. But if that were to play out, hypothetically speaking, we would not be averse to raising capital, if needed, through asset sales. This is, again, I think, will accrue to our benefit given the quality of assets that we have being able to assemble especially over the last 10 years, and more specifically, over the last 3 to 4 years. So that continues to remain a strategy but one that we hope doesn't play out because I think the only scenario where I can see that happening is a macro environment where things are incredibly uncertain. And I hope that, that doesn't play out that way. But look, it's absolutely a theoretical strategy that we can lean on if needed. Yes. Look, it is certainly a story that is playing out very differently for those that are well-capitalized businesses versus those that tend to be smaller operators in this high inflationary environment. We had Neil's team, the research team, do an analysis on our top 150 clients. And they represent about 85% of our rent. And we were like very focused on what is going to happen to their balance sheet, their ability to pay in the event that interest rates were to rise 300 basis points from where it is currently. And, this is a big and, they didn't have the ability to pass through any of those increased costs that they were bearing on to their customers, which is a highly unlikely scenario, but we were trying to figure out what would happen in that particular scenario for us. And it was 11 of these operators of the 150 representing less than 5% of our rent where the coverages fell below 1x. So, we feel like \u2013 again, by design, we have created a client registry that's predominantly made up of very well capitalized operators. But those one-off operators \u2013 and Caitlin you are right, we have 1,000 different clients. So, we certainly have a few one-off operators that tend to be smaller operators. It is going to be more difficult for them to be able to absorb this and their inability to pass through their costs. But we have had a few general merchandising stores. We have had a few folks who are going to \u2013 who have actually talked about increasing EBIT margins because of their ability to pass-through a lot of these costs. And predominantly, our client registries made up of those types of folks. So, yes, hypothetically, Caitlin, the smaller operators will suffer in this environment and may not make it. But thankfully, we don't have too much exposure to that, and it is very small in terms of percentage of our overall rent. Hi Ron. Yes. So, the biggest element to closing this transaction is the licensing process, and we are well in the midst of going through that process. We have submitted our application. It is being reviewed by the Massachusetts Gaming Group. And we are very hopeful that by fourth quarter, we will be in a position to close this transaction. But that really is the one outstanding element to be able to close this transaction, but so far so good. Everything that we are hearing, everything that we have received in terms of MGC's response to our initial application has been quite positive. So, we feel pretty good about that. In terms of the industry itself, no surprise, we are getting a lot of inbounds from potential sale-leaseback opportunities. And the team is reviewing them one at a time. But our thesis around this particular space remains the same. We want to partner with the best-in-class operators and find assets that are truly one-of-a-kind, just like we did with the Boston asset. And if at a very high level, those criterias are met, we will absolutely continue to increase our exposure to this particular sector. Sure. So Ron, I mean you have seen us grow our existing relationships to areas where they start to dominate our shareholder registry. So, for instance, I will give you a perfect example. We did the first sale-leaseback with Dollar General. This was, I believe in 2015- 2016 timeframe, and it was maybe $130 million, $140 million sale-leaseback. We subsequently continued to grow our opportunity with Dollar General through multiple sale-leasebacks. It's a similar story with 7-Eleven. A lot of these clients that you see in our top 20 have grown over multiple years and they continue to have ambitious growth profile. So, that channel of growth remains for us. Then we also have the ability to do first-time sale-leasebacks in a large way with clients like Wynn. These are asset classes that tend to be very large. But again, given that we are about a $57 billion, $58 billion company today, it is going to register as a 3.5% client. And clearly, we have said this very openly that in the event, Wynn decides to continue to execute and grow their footprint beyond the two locations that they currently have, we would love to continue to partner with them. And so this is a function of being able to do first time sale-leasebacks in a big way. And now that we are of the size that we are, our ability to absorb those \u2013 and when I say big, I mean $1 billion sale-leaseback, even multiple billion dollar sale-leasebacks that has grown over the last few years and especially post the VEREIT merger. Sure. Yes. Hi Josh. I wish our business was a spigot where you could switch it off and turn it back on at a moment's notice. Unfortunately, our business doesn't work quite like that. When you think about how we source opportunities and how we create a pipeline of opportunities and what is the timing that it takes from making a decision to pursuing a particular transaction and then closing it, it could take anywhere between four months to six months from start to finish. So, unless you have a crystal ball, it is very, very difficult to be able to sort of do exactly what you suggested, which would have been perfect, if we could. The other thing I would tell you is there is a lag even in our cost of capital. When you have volatile situations like this, but you are seeing opportunities that seem very well priced on a pure real estate underwriting in terms of replacement costs, in terms of price per pound, and you think about the leases that we are able to capture with the clients that are engaging in these types of transactions, you obviously build into your underwriting a particular buffer. And hopefully, we have been conservative enough where we are still being able to capture positive healthy spreads to our cost of capital while continuing to enhance the \u2013 our basic AFFO per share growth as well as our client registry with new relationships. So, it's very difficult. We had a different mindset over the next six months to nine months, which said, hey, the world is going to fall apart. We absolutely will pull in our horns just like we did in that very first quarter right after the \u2013 it was actually the second quarter of 2020, when the pandemic hit where we slowed down our ability to sort of continue looking at transactions, and truth be told, even the market there, the transaction market sort of went silent for a bit, just because people are very unsure of how things are going to play out. But that I have already shared with you is not the case. Sourcing remains very healthy. And we feel like even with the appropriate flexing of our own cost of capital, we are able to grow our business in a manner that is very much aligned with our acquisition strategy. But Josh, I will be very honest, if our views change, we will stop continuing to build the pipeline. But that is not the case right now. The right opportunities. There are already a set of countries that we have preapproved, so to speak, internally and have shared with our Board that there are countries that we would like to be able to grow in the event the right opportunities come along. We have identified the businesses that we would like to do business with. We have identified the clients. We have identified the fact that these are businesses that will continue to thrive even in cycles like the one that we are experiencing. And if those boxes are checked and we are able to sort of strike the right balance in terms of spreads, etcetera, that's what's going to allow us to continue to expand our geographic footprint in Western Europe. Thank you, Josh. Well, John, that's what makes us different, right. I mean if you look at our world, vis-a\u0300-vis our peers, we are at right around 8 years, 8.5 years. And if you look at our lease maturity schedule and I think I said this during my prepared remarks that 12% of our leases are going to renew over the next 2.5 years. And so it does \u2013 if we can keep this momentum, I don't know if it will be 106%, but the other thing I would say about that 106% is it's effectively net increases. And so if we can keep it in that ZIP code, that will become a major growth driver for our business, and it will become an internal growth driver of our business, especially if we continue down this highly inflationary environment. The other good news is if you think about our international expansion, a lot of those leases tend to be CPI-adjusted leases. And they don't tend to have this collar \u2013 a ceiling and a floor that we experience here, but it's a relative comment. I would say the vast majority of CPI leases that we have here in the U.S. tend to have a collar. And I would say maybe one-third to even 40% of the leases in the international markets tend to be \u2013 basically do not have a collar around it, and they are very much tied to CPI growth. And so I think all of that will start to percolate through our portfolio and will help us drive more internal growth than what we have historically experienced in our business. And we think of this as an opportunity, and we have been talking about asset management now for about 5 years, 6 years in anticipation of what we are now starting to experience as a company. And so look, we think we are very positively set up to take advantage of this situation. And it then helps us alleviate some of the pressure of just growing through external measures, which of course, is also something that the team is doing very well. Yes. It's by design, John. We want development to continue to tick up because we do get more spread doing development. And this allows us to continue to be the one-stop solution that our clients are looking for. And just to be super clear, we are talking about build-to-suit on 99% of our development. So, I mean... John, they are build-to-suit. So, by definition, they are being driven by our clients coming to us or coming to a developer and saying we would like to have you develop here in this particular location because we would like to enter into a long-term lease. And we have either relationships directly with our clients who then ask us to work with the developer or with some developers who have asked us to become their capital source as a permanent takeout. And that is what's allowing us to continue to enhance our development pipeline. So, this is absolutely being driven by the clients, not by us. This was just a hole in our overall strategy that we are now addressing in a meaningful way. Thanks John. 10%. Linda, I am not trying to be flippant, but look, our intention is to try to drive that up. Some of it will naturally come with the expansion in asset types. There are certain asset types that lend themselves to higher organic growth. That was part of the attraction that we had with investing in industrial assets, and we saw that. And some of these other asset types, just like I said, do have a higher profile than the 1% that we have traditionally been able to get in the space that we had targeted historically. So, could I see that tick up, that's the hope with more international acquisition, with more industrial, with more development where we can create more bespoke leases. If we can get that 1% to 1.5% to 2%, that would be a major uplift and a source of internal growth. But that's not going to happen overnight. It's going to take us time, and it's going to take intentionality, which we certainly have. We are not quite there where we would want to sell our theater portfolio, Linda. In fact, all indications have been all trend lines have indicated that the theater business is getting back to a strong footing despite all of the noise that we hear about the theater business and PBOD [ph] and all of that. In fact, I was looking at some numbers in the first quarter of 2022. We are back to about 75% of 2019 levels. And so clearly, this is a business that is largely driven by content. We are also very encouraged by the pipeline of big-tent movies that are going to be released over the next two months to three months. We are very hopeful that, that will translate to more attendance. And the good news is a couple of these large operators like Regal and AMC are cash flowing positive on the assets that we own. So, I think all of that leads us to believe that this industry as we had hoped and our hypothesis was is sort of on demand. Having said all of that, we also did a fair amount of downside scenario analysis where we looked at some of these locations and we feel like we have the ability, the capital, the relationships to reposition these assets in the event that the business doesn't play out. I think the wrong economic decision today would be to sell some of these assets at what I would consider to be fire sale prices. And again, just to remind everyone, 82% of our portfolio is in the top two quartiles of performance for both these operators. So, we feel very good about the theater business, but more specifically about the portfolio that we own. And so the decision to sell, though a theoretical one and has been considered, is one that we are not in a position to execute on given some of what I just said. Thank you. Thank you all for joining us, and we look forward to speaking at the upcoming NAREIT conference. Thank you all. Bye-bye."

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, today's event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Steve Bakke, Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance. Please go ahead, sir.\nSteve Bakke: Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's fourth quarter operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jonathan Pong, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. During this conference call, we will make statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. The Company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the Company's Form 10-K. We'll be observing a two-question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you would like to ask additional questions, you may reenter the queue. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy.\nSumit Roy: Thank you, Steve, and welcome, everyone. Our fourth quarter and 2023 full-year results demonstrate the unique platform value that Realty Income has built, which differentiates us as a real estate partner to the world's leading companies. During the year, we accomplished several milestones, which illustrate the benefits bestowed to us by our size, scale and relationships. First, we set an annual high in property level investment volume closing on over $9.5 billion in high-quality diversified investments across eight different countries and through 271 discrete transactions at a weighted average cash yield of 7.1%. The year was punctuated with a particularly active fourth quarter as we closed on $2.7 billion of investments at a weighted average cash yield of 7.6%. Our fourth quarter activity included a $527 million sale leaseback transaction with Decathlon, one of the world's leading investment-grade rated sporting goods retailers and included properties located in Germany, France, Spain, Italy and Portugal. Despite a volatile capital markets environment, we achieved an investment spread of approximately 115 basis points in the fourth quarter and approximately 120 basis points in 2023. We were able to achieve these spreads without sacrificing our focus on the quality of real estate or security of cash flow, which is a testament to our experienced team and the merits that sophisticated sellers see in transacting with our platform. Second, during the year we established a presence in the data center sector through a build-to-suit development joint venture with Digital Realty. And we incubated new relationships with blue-chip partners such as Blackstone and the EG Group through large scale investments, including the $950 million investment for a 21.9% stake in the Bellagio and the $1.5 billion sale leaseback involving primarily Cumberland Farm convenience stores. Third, and in addition to the achievements noted above, we also announced the $9.3 billion merger with Spirit Realty Capital in an all-stock transaction in October, which closed subsequent to year-end on January 23. These accomplishments contributed to our 2023 AFFO per share of $4, representing an approximately 7% total operational return for the year, and importantly, together with the Spirit merger, set us up to deliver a compelling earnings growth backdrop in 2024. We believe that the close of the Spirit merger last month along with meaningful debt and equity capital raising activity completed at attractive prices in December and January that Jonathan will describe in more detail, leave us well-positioned to deliver robust growth in 2024. We here initiated an AFFO per share guidance range of $4.13 to $4.21 per share for 2024, which represents an annual growth rate of 4.3% at the midpoint. We believe we can achieve this growth rate without the selling of additional public equity. Inclusive of our dividend, this positions us to deliver a total operational return of more than 10% at the midpoint of the guidance range based on the trading price of our common stock as of February 20, 2024. In addition to the $9.3 billion Spirit merger, we're also providing 2024 acquisitions guidance of approximately $2 billion, which is expected to be fully funded via a combination of our portfolios internally generated cash flow now exceeding $800 million after dividend payments on an annualized basis, as well as approximately $605 million of unsettled ATM proceeds and our $3.7 billion of cash and unutilized availability on our revolving credit facility as of year-end. While we continue to source and review high-quality investment opportunities, we remain highly selective deploying capital only into attractive risk adjusted return opportunities that meet both our near-term and long-term investment spread requirements. Of our $2 billion initial investment volume forecast, approximately half is expected to come in the form of development financing, the vast majority of which is already identified. To reiterate, our favorable return profile in 2024 carries very little execution risk from an investment standpoint, allowing us the flexibility to remain patient, disciplined and opportunistic from a capital deployment standpoint. That said, as we demonstrated during the height of the pandemic, our platform affords us the opportunity to pivot quickly back into growth mode should market conditions change. While we intend to remain disciplined in our investments to ensure appropriate risk-adjusted returns for our investors, we continue to highlight why we are best positioned to capitalize on compelling opportunities over the long term. First, the opportunity to consolidate the fragmented net lease real estate market is vast. We estimate $14 trillion total addressable market in the U.S. and Europe across traditional net lease and emerging verticals like data centers and gaming. Second, we have firmly demonstrated our capabilities deploying capital, having invested $9 billion or more including public M&A in each of the last three years since exiting the pandemic year of 2020. Over this time, we have generated annualized AFFO per share growth of approximately 6% and we have provided a total operational return to stockholders of approximately 10% per year. Looking to 2024 and beyond, we are on track to achieve similar capital deployment and AFFO per share growth objectives this year. We are particularly energized by the prospect to participate meaningfully in verticals like data centers and gaming, where we are seeing opportunities to earn healthy initial yields with attractive contractual rent escalators. Third, the Spirit merger deepens our ability to access capital markets through increased trading volume in our publicly-listed stock, which has averaged more than $400 million of daily trading volume since the Spirit transaction was announced. This places us in the top 150 of S&P 500 companies and is more than 7x the net lease peer average over the same timeframe, leaving us even better situated to fund our business in a highly efficient and non-disruptive manner through our ATM equity program. Fourth, our real estate portfolio is becoming increasingly diversified over time and consists of properties leased to relationship clients representing some of the world's leading companies in their respective industries. Diversified exposure to these clients reinforces the stability of our platform and accordingly are growing monthly dividend payments. Finally, the power of our platform is a crucial differentiator as we leverage our expertise across ownership of over 15,400 properties globally, inclusive of the Spirit portfolio. Our experience managing over 5,900 lease outcomes since 1996 provides learnings that feed into analytic AI tools that provide actionable insights, enabling us to more accurately identify acquisition opportunities and to maximize the value of our existing holdings. Continuing with our key operational results from the fourth quarter, investment volume of approximately $2.7 billion was allocated to high-quality investments at a weighted average cash yield of approximately 7.6%. We completed $1.1 billion of total investment volume internationally at a weighted average cash yield of 7.8%. Investments were made across 119 distinct transactions, including 29 sale leaseback transactions equating to $884 million of volume. Our full year investment activity was $9.5 billion, of which 35% was derived internationally, serving as a testament to the value of our investment platform\u2019s global footprint. Included in fourth quarter volume was a loan we made to ASDA stores in the UK at a 10.9% yield. The loan is backed by ownership interests and properties containing grocery stores and supermarkets and was extended as part of a sale leaseback transaction with ASDA. In addition, fourth quarter volume included our previously announced $650 million of preferred equity investment in the Bellagio JV with Blackstone, which earns an 8.1% yield. Similar to the loan investment in ASDA, the Bellagio preferred equity investment was paired with investment in high-quality real estate. For both investments, our ability to offer a broadened suite of capital solutions to clients granted us access to high-quality net lease real estate investments at superior risk adjusted returns than we could have otherwise achieved. These transactions serve as templates for future sale leaseback transactions. Also in the fourth quarter, we made our initial investment in a data center development JV with Digital Realty. The initial $200 million investment represents an 80% equity investment in the venture and is expected to generate a 6.9% initial cash yield, 2% annual rent escalators and a long-term triple-net lease with an S&P 100 investment grade client upon completion. Turning to portfolio operations, same-store rent grew 2.6% in the fourth quarter and 1.9% for the year, benefiting in part from lower net bad debt expense compared to the prior year. On a normalized basis, our contractual rent growth approximates 1.5% on an annual basis based on the current composition of our portfolio. This amount is up over 50 basis points from just five years ago and is a result of an intentional push by our team to generate enhanced organic growth. We remain committed to walking this growth rate higher over time through our deliberate underwriting strategy. Our diligent asset management efforts led to a recapture rate of 103.6% during the quarter and 104.1% for the year excluding the impact of the Cineworld bankruptcy. At year-end, occupancy was 98.6%, a 20 basis point decline from the prior quarter as a result of expected client move outs. I will now turn it over to Jonathan who will add further color to the quarter.\nJonathan Pong: Thank you, Sumit. We completed an active quarter in the capital markets during the fourth quarter raising $1.6 billion of equity at a weighted average price of $56.25. Including activity subsequent to year-end, we currently have approximately $605 million of outstanding forward equity available to finance a portion of our equity needs in 2024. When combined with over $800 million of annual free cash flow available to us following the Spirit merger, we have the ability to finance all of our equity needs for our $2 billion investments guidance without having to tap into the public equity markets for the remainder of 2024. And this is before any capital recycling opportunities throughout the sales, which we expect to be north of the $116 million volume we achieved in 2023. As Sumit mentioned earlier, our AFFO per share guidance midpoint implies 4.3% annual growth and assumes only $2 million of investments volume, with almost half are re-accounted for in our development pipeline. From a debt capital market standpoint, we de-risked our 2024 maturity schedule through approximately $2.2 billion of bond issuance activity in a 45-day span, beginning with our GBP 750 million sterling notes offering in December and culminating in our US$1.25 billion offering that closed last month. Combined, the two offerings blend to a weighted average tenure of approximately 10.2 years and weighted average yield to maturity of approximately 5.5%. Near-term, these two offerings allow us to fund our business given our current investment outlook without needing to tap into the debt capital markets in 2024, which we believe was a prudent approach given the persistent instability that has permeated the capital markets over the last two years. There are also longer term strategic considerations that dictated this approach. Following our debut euro offerings in the summer of 2023, we believe these offerings also support our steadfast desire to maintain investor diversification across our multi currency debt complex, while pocketing future debt repayment risk in years with meaningful capacity. Last month, we also exercised the first of two one-year extension options available to us on our $1.1 billion multi currency term loan that we established in January of 2023. In conjunction with the extension, we entered into a two-year floating to fixed interest rate swap that effectively locked in a fixed rate of approximately 4.85% on this principle through its maturity date in January 2026. In conjunction with the closing of the Spirit merger, we also assumed $1.3 billion of term loan debt from Spirit, as well as $1.3 billion in existing floating to fixed interest rate swaps, which resulted in an effective weighted average fixed rate of 3.9% on that debt. Of this term loan principal, $800 million matures in 2025 and $500 million matures in 2027. Moving on to key credit metrics at year end, we finished the year with net debt to annualized pro form EBITDA of 5.5x, in line with our targeted leverage ratio and this excludes the $605 million of outstanding forward equity we currently have available to us. Our fixed charge coverage finished the year at 4.7x, which was the high watermark for us in 2023, benefiting from higher investment yields in the fourth quarter and less and lower cost short-term borrowings outstanding. In 2024, we do anticipate an increase of $45 million in annualized non-cash interest expense we expect to recognize from the amortization of below market debt on the Spirit debt we assumed. Note that this non-cash interest expense adjustment does lower annual FFO per share run rate by approximately $0.05 per share, but is not reflected in AFFO, thus explaining the primary reason why our initial FFO and AFFO guidance ranges are more closely bound than in 2023. We would note that purchase price accounting adjustments are ongoing for the merger and thus straight line rents and FAS 141 adjustments from the merger are likely to push FFO higher once finalized, and we will adjust our FFO guidance at that time. Of course, these are non-cash adjustments that do not impact AFFO. Looking forward, I would like to reiterate Sumit's opening comments about our lack of reliance on the capital markets to fund our growth in 2024. From a liquidity perspective, we view our near-term capital availability as a strength of following our bond yield last month, we had into the rest of 2024 with approximately $4 billion of liquidity at year-end, variable rate debt representing less than 5% of our total debt capital stack and no capital market execution risk to fund our growth for the remainder of 2024. With that, I'll turn it back over to Sumit for closing remarks.\nSumit Roy : Thank you, Jonathan. Before concluding, I would like to extend my immense gratitude to Ron Merriman for his valued service to Realty Income on our Board of Directors the past 19 years. Ron's leadership, guidance and mentorship have been invaluable and we all owe him our sincere thanks. I would also like to extend a warm welcome to Jeff Jacobson, who will be joining our Board. I'm thrilled for all of us at Realty Income to benefit from Jeff's perspective as a former CEO of one of the world's premier global real estate asset management firms, LaSalle Investment Management and in his current role as the Chairman of the Board of Cadillac Fairview Corporation. In conclusion, our results in 2023 underscore the multiple avenues of growth at our disposal in the global commercial real estate industry, including through one-off and portfolio acquisitions, multiple asset types, corporate sale leasebacks, development and joint venture partnerships and via public M&A opportunities. The depth of our platform, team and relationships enable us to leverage some or all of these sourcing avenues concurrently as opportunities arise. In 2023, we completed five transactions greater than $500 million in size and two of which were greater than $1 billion excluding the Spirit merger. These are transactions that Realty Income was uniquely positioned to execute given our size, scale and access to capital globally. These distinct competitive advantages support us in serving as real estate partner to the world's leading companies at an unparalleled scale. Moreover, we believe that serving as capital provider to a diverse spectrum of clients, who are leaders in their respective industries, furthers our core mission to deliver dependable monthly dividends that grow over time. We will now open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please go ahead.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. First question is just on the acquisition guidance. You're starting the year with $2 billion of acquisitions. It sounds like you have visibility into half of them. Really like the execution risk for the year is only for $1 billion. What has to change in order for that number to kind of move higher through the year? Is it interest rates? Is it opportunities that come to you? Is it your ability to use to do deals kind of like what you've done with the Bellagio with preferred equity or with the loan with ASDA to get it done? Like, how should we think about the potential for upside for that number and that number moving higher through the year?\nSumit Roy: Thank you for that question, Michael. It's a lot of what you just said. If you look at the market today and you look at the cap rate environment, the adjustments that we have seen has not been commensurate with the movement in the cost of capital. And we are coming out with a business plan that basically says, okay, these two variables that we don't control are not going to be part of how we deliver the 4.3% growth and north of 10% total return growth. And that's the reason for the numbers that we have shared with you. If the cap rates were to adjust, we will be first in line to take advantage of that. If the interest rate environments were to start to go down, which would then have an impact on our cost of capital, i.e., lower cost of capital, we would be first in line to react. We wanted to come out with a business plan that had no reliance on the capital markets on the funding side and come up with a number which we all believe very, very confidently that we will be able to meet, if not exceed. If the environment were to change, i.e., interest rate were to start to go down et cetera, which would have a positive impact on our cost of capital. Do believe that a lot of the conversations that we are having, so it's not the conversations that have dried up, it's the expectation in the market around what the reservation price needs to be that needs to move. And that can happen either through the movement of cap rates or through our cost of capital getting better. And right now, we feel very confident in saying the plan that we have has very little to no risk and we can deliver a 10% plus return without having to be aggressive in the market. And that's really the thesis around what we've come out with.\nMichael Goldsmith: No. That's helpful, Sumit. And then if we think about -- as my follow-up question, not to be -- we still have a lot to get through with '24. So this question isn't necessarily specific to '25, but just like the philosophy of if the environment stays kind of in a similar-ish range than where it is right now, where you just there isn't a lot of deals getting done. The transaction market remains kind of murky, you've driven. You've locked in growth for '24 through an acquisition. How would you think about -- how would you think about navigating through a multi -- a potentially multi-year kind of murky environment? Yes, exactly. How do you plan on navigating through a multi-year murky environment, if that was the case?\nSumit Roy: So Michael, the reason I believe that cap rates haven't moved is because of the volatility in the market. If there was certainty that, hey, this cost of capital environment is going to remain at these elevated levels for the next three years, guess what? Cap rates will adjust, will move, and there will be more willingness on the part of the seller to transact today. We had the tenure at a 4.2 towards the end of last year, it dropped down to 3.75 in January, and then it's back up to 4.2. In that sort of environment, you have sellers that are saying, we expect the Fed to start cutting interest rate later in the year. I think it can hold off another six to seven months. So why transact in this environment today? And I think that's the reason why we have hesitation and lack of this widespread movement in cap rates that one would expect if people were to bind to the fact that this cost of capital environment has been permanently impaired. So I think in this scenario that you've sort of dictated, if that were to be the norm and if everybody were to accept that, that, hey, for the next three years, the cost of capital environment is not going to change, I do think transactions are going to come back. I do think cap rates will move much more than they have done so. And yes, we'll be the ones first in line to take advantage of that.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein with BOA Merrill Lynch.\nJoshua Dennerlein: I appreciate the time. Just wanted to -- I had a question on the development funding. How do we think about the NOI from that development funding coming online? Do you only get NOI or return once the project is finished? Or do you get like a return as the money is kind of drawn down for that development?\nJonathan Pong: Josh, this is Jonathan. One way to think about it because the answer is really going to vary depending on the lease. But if we're doing a development takeout, obviously, we put the funds down when the project is done, we get those assets and the rent starts and there's really no lag. If it's a development build-to-suit we're funding along the way. A little bit more nuance associated with that, where you're not quite getting the economics that we are entitled to as we put this funding out. However, from an accounting standpoint, the way that it flows through to the income statement is through essentially our cost of short-term debt. And so from a modeling perspective, the most clean way to do it, in my view, would be to just assume when you see us developing and deploying capital, that's when the yield begins because in most cases, that's going to be the case.\nSumit Roy: Yes, the vast majority of the pipeline are takeouts, Josh. So this is really entering into a forward contract. We are not deploying capital as the assets being developed. And once it's developed and the certificate of occupancy is received, we are essentially buying the asset at that point. And obviously, rent is commencing at that point. So that's how one should think about the development pipeline.\nJoshua Dennerlein: And I appreciate all that color. Maybe one more on development. I guess just how do we think about development as kind of like when you look across like your appetite to acquire new assets, like how do you think about like development? Is this something you're going to lean into more? There are better yields on developments versus just straight-up acquisitions. Just kind of curious.\nSumit Roy: Yes. It's just yet another tool that is available to us to drive growth, Josh. That's how we think about development. We have existing client relationships. They have aggressive plans of expansion. They come to us and they say, hey, we are working with this developer. Would you be interested in getting slightly higher yields than what the market would dictate if this asset were available today? And would you lend your balance sheet to help us expand? And that is part of how we are building out our development pipeline because the expectation is that the yield one can generate through development should be superior to what one could get in the transaction market if that asset were fully operational today. That was the thesis. Now obviously, you might see that some of the yields that we have posted on these developments were slightly lower than what we were able to get in the acquisitions market, and this is largely a function of how quickly the cost of capital environment changed and the adjustments that did take place on the cap rate side, but on the way down on the cost of capital side, this will also manifest itself as a positive to what the markets are going to be. So for instance, the types of transactions we are entering into today on the development side, we'll have -- will be reflective of the yield environment today. And if the cost of capital were to improve, let's say, a year from now to 1.5 years from now, when these assets get delivered, there will be a positive spread that you should see on the development yields versus the -- at that time, cap rates that are transacting in the market. So this is really yet another tool. This will never be a dominant part of our business, but it is certainly a tool that if we want to view ourselves as the real estate partners to leading operators. This is a tool that we want to also provide to our clients to help them grow their business.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Got it. And if I can sneak one more in. Sorry about that. Does your -- I know your guide is only $2 billion, but when you think about your broader pipeline, are there a lot of portfolio deals out there? Like bigger transactions out there? I know they take a while to close. Just kind of curious.\nSumit Roy: So Josh, I think I tried to hint that on the last conversation when somebody asked about what are you seeing, what's driving the movement in the market. I can tell you that we are continuing to have a multitude of conversations with our clients, where there's a disconnect is what is the price at which they are willing to transact. And that's where the disconnect is. So it's not that suddenly we are not talking to our clients. We, in fact, one of our largest clients, we spoke with them a couple of weeks ago and where the conversation sort of ended was their expectation of cap rates versus what it is that we could -- what it is that we would need to be able to generate the kind of spreads that would allow us to do the transaction. And that's where -- that's the type of conversations we're having. And clearly, if you look at what we did last year, more than five transactions were above $500 million in size, two of which were above $1 billion in size. That's what we can deliver. That's what we can bring to the table. And that's what our clients need are big solutions to big problems. And so yes, when the spigots open and this reservation price is going to be met by our cost of capital, we will be able to take advantage of and build out our pipeline just like we did the last three years.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Nate Crossett with BNP.\nNate Crossett: Just one on the pipeline ex development. I'm just curious if you've closed on anything so far in Q1? And if so, what was the pricing on that? And then my second question is the occupancy guide was a bit below current levels. So maybe you can just give us a little color on that? And what's on the watch list right now that we should be tracking?\nSumit Roy: Hi, Nate. So I'm not going to start giving you cap rates on assets that we have closed in the first quarter. Suffice it to say that there have been transactions that we have closed on in the first quarter. It is reflective of some of the comments that we've made. There has been movement in cap rates. You'll see that when we report our first quarter numbers, but the movement in cap rates is not as widespread as we would like to see. It's not reflective of the changes that have occurred in the cost of capital side. So -- but yes, our flow business is ongoing. And we are being a lot more selective about making sure that our spreads are not being compromised just to create volume. And we have the advantage of coming into this year with a business plan that allows us to do that. With regards to occupancy, we have mentioned that it's going to be above 98%. A lot of these were expected, at lease expiration, these were expected vacancies. And we have -- we generally tend to sort of guide to this low 98% occupancy. Part of what makes our business slightly different from perhaps what you see with the other -- with some of our other peers is we actually like to hold on to some of our vacant assets given the ability to reposition these assets and create more economic value. I know that for a long time over the last six quarters, we were hovering around that 99%, which was unusual for us. But we are very comfortable if we believe that we can generate more economic value which supersedes the holding cost of some of these vacant assets by repositioning it, et cetera, we are very comfortable doing so. So the way to think about how we run our business is the normalized level of occupancy should be in this 98.5% ZIP code. This 1.5% is vacancy that we need to be able to execute on the plans that I\u2019ve just laid out.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.\nBrad Heffern: Sumit, can you talk about the relative attractiveness of Europe right now versus the U.S.? It seems like you don't think anything is all that attractive overall, but at least in Europe, you have the better cost of debt?\nSumit Roy: Yes, that's a great question, Brad. I will tell you that even in Europe, the volume of transactions is a lot lower, again, because of this disconnect between buyers and sellers and what each requires to perpetuate a transaction. However, having said that, we are seeing pockets of opportunities, especially in the UK, where we feel like even in this environment, transactions can get done. And so that, along with the fact that at least in Europe, our cost of debt is significantly lower by 110, 120 basis points. We are continuing to look for opportunities. But the volume being low is not just unique to the U.S. It is across the geographies that we play in.\nBrad Heffern: And then, Jonathan, I thought there might be more of a reduction in G&A as a percent of revenue this year than what the guidance suggested just given the additional revenue from Spirit was coming with not much additional G&A. So is there anything else going on that's keeping that figure from declining more?\nJonathan Pong: Brad, there\u2019s always going to be a fair amount of conservatism sitting here in mid-February on line items like that. We did have quite a bit of growth from a resource standpoint in the back half of 2023, you\u2019re going to see the full annualized effect of that. And it\u2019s still too early to tell on the synergies front with Spirit, what ultimately is going to be achievable, but in the first month or so less than that of ownership, everything is trending to better than we expected from a synergy standpoint. And as a reminder, on a cash basis, we expected $30 million of synergies off of a $40 million cash G&A load annualized. So we\u2019re hopeful, but look, we\u2019re trying to create a platform. We\u2019re trying to refine certain areas of the business, but we\u2019re really trying to resource with everything going on, all of our groups to create this moat, if you will, that can persist for a long time. So with that comes a little bit of investment in things like technology and in people. So that\u2019s really the driver of that.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho.\nHaendel St. Juste: Good morning out there. I guess my first question is on the investment spreads here. I think you guys previously outlined expectations for a minimum of 200 basis point spread on new investments versus your cost of capital, which is well above, I guess, what you saw last year. So I guess I'm curious, one is the 200 basis points still kind of your minimum required spread? And if so, how do you achieve that today given where your cost of capital is -- appears to be somewhere in the 6s.? And if that requires using some of your free cash flow, how are you thinking about the required return for that portion of your capital as well?\nSumit Roy: Haendel, thank you for your question. So a couple of points. I've heard a few comments around free cash flow. We are going to generate north of $800 million in free cash flow. If you think about our $2 billion of acquisition guidance, this represents 40% of the total volume. And on a leverage-neutral basis, this represents 60% of the total capital. So to be able to generate 200 basis points on free cash flow is actually you can do deals at 2% cap rates and still generate 200 basis points. But obviously, that's not how we think about our business. And by the way, the 200 basis points that we were able to achieve, I would say now about 3 years ago, 2.5 years ago, that was in an environment where our cost of capital was massively different than what it is today. And being able to generate 200 basis points was not that difficult. On average, from the time we've been tracking spreads, we have always said that the average spread has been 150 basis points. We also want to make it clear that there will be times like last year and the fourth quarter of last year and all of last year where we did 120 basis points, where when you build up a pipeline with a certain backdrop with regards to your cost of capital and the cap rates that you're entering into a contract in. And by the time you close, if your cost of capital environment changes and you're permanently financing it at that point in time, that's precisely what happened all of last year. We had a very robust pipeline and we were entering into contracts with the expectation of not necessarily 200 basis points, but certainly 150 basis points and sometimes well north of that. But by the time we actually permanently finance the transaction, the cost of capital environment was different. And just to make another point, if you actually look at the cost of permanent financing that we ultimately effectuated in 2023, what we locked in, in terms of spread was closer to 140 basis points. It was 136 basis points, I think. So much closer to the average that we have since we've been tracking this particular metric. But I just want to make sure that if the expectation is that in any transaction that we enter into, we're going to try to lock in 200 basis points. That's not how we think about pursuing transactions. We also use a bar build strategy where there might be transactions that are precisely the right investment for us. And if it only creates 100 basis points, we believe that on a risk-adjusted return basis, that is the right profile for that investment, we are comfortable doing that particular investment. But then we will always try to balance it with transactions that have a 200 basis point profile. But that volatility or that spectrum of spreads in this volatile environment is very difficult to predict, which is why we are -- we've come out with the plan that we have, which -- even in this environment, we can still deliver north of 10% without having to rely on the acquisition market.\nHaendel St. Juste: I appreciate that. I just want to be clear, it sounds like 200 basis points is not the absolute minimum that you're seeking, which I think is a little different for what I think we had talked about a few months ago. But my next question, I guess, is on what's embedded in the guide here regarding credit loss and the integration of the Spirit portfolio? Can you touch on that a little bit?\nSumit Roy: The integration is going very well. We've closed on the transaction on the 23. We are still very excited about the portfolio we've absorbed. As part of this transaction, we've hired eight people from Spirit on a permanent basis. And we have seven people on a temporary basis that are helping us through the integration process over the next six to nine months. In terms of the actual portfolio itself, we have not been surprised by -- now that we control this asset and the portfolio of clients that we are exposed to, we have not been negatively surprised on any front. There have been some positive surprises in terms of resolutions to certain clients where the outcome has been slightly more positive. But I will caution and say that it is still too early to tell. And that is part of the reason why we were very conservative in our underwriting. And what we shared with the market, we felt very comfortable in terms of delivering. But we've also said that it was conservative, and there happens to be upside, which we hope plays out. And if that's the case, we will share that information with you down the road.\nHaendel St. Juste: Got it. But are you able to quantify within the guide for potential credit loss or any added color on that?\nSumit Roy: What we can share with you, Haendel, is the range that we have shared with you accommodates for any level of credit loss that the Spirit portfolio and/or our portfolio would generate.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Spenser Allaway with Green Street Advisors.\nSpenser Allaway: Given the dearth of deal volume right now, especially compared to recent years, what is the highest and best use of time right now? So I know you have a massive portfolio but outside of routine asset management, I'm just curious at this quiet period, if you will, is a good opportunity to underwrite new geographies or property types?\nSumit Roy: It's all of those things, Spenser. I mean -- I think you've been following us for a while. We are constantly looking for ways to grow our portfolio and we are constantly looking at non-traditional ways to growing our earnings. And that will continue to be a massive focus of ours in 2024. You're absolutely right, part of having to absorb an additional 2,000 assets with 400 new clients, not all new clients, but 400 clients coming from Spirit. There's going to be a fair amount of asset and capital recycling that we would like to also engage in and that is something that the team is very much focused on, trying to take advantage of the time that we have to focus on playing a little bit of defense rather than the offense. But having said all of that, I do believe that this acquisitions environment can change and can change very quickly. And so the rest of the team, the investment team continues to stay in front of the clients, continues to have conversations, continues to be creative about how we could potentially be a solution to our clients. And so despite the guidance of $2 billion, I can tell you there is going to be a lot of work, perhaps even more so this year than last year in terms of creating the right tools, creating the right efficiencies, all of the things that we've sort of had to put a little bit on the back burner given the robustness of the investment environment that we've had over the last three years. So I think all of that will manifest itself in a much more scalable business, and we'll be happy to share some of that as and when we put it to use and actually start to realize some of the scale benefits.\nSpenser Allaway: Okay. Great. And do you guys have a target date for when you'd like to get through the kind of the Spirit portfolio in terms of pegging some potential disposition candidates and things of that nature? Do you guys have a target date when you want to get to the portfolio?\nSumit Roy: We are not waiting on a particular date. There\u2019s obviously a priority of assets that we have identified that we don\u2019t believe to be core to our overall portfolio. Those are already in the market. And then we are culling through the rest of the portfolio to continue to add to our capital recycling program for 2024. So there isn\u2019t a particular target date, but we\u2019ll be happy to share with you more on this front during the first quarter earnings when we\u2019ll have assumed control of this portfolio for about 2 months and 10 days.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Smedes Rose with Citi.\nSmedes Rose: I wanted to go back to something you mentioned in your opening remarks where you were talking about being able to put in more growth opportunities into your leases? I think you mentioned it's up 50 basis points versus five years ago. And as you speak to, I guess my question is, I'm wondering, does the quality or sort of the credit quality of the client vary by the ability to push through higher escalators? It sort of feels like the higher quality or higher credit would have more bargaining power on their side to resist those kinds of changes. But I'd just be interested in kind of if you could just maybe talk about that a little more.\nSumit Roy: Sure. Smedes, your intuition is accurate. In the retail space here in the U.S., when you start to talk to investment-grade clients on the retail side, on retail boxes, that enter into long-term leases, et cetera, it is very difficult to get them to give you what one would consider to be market growth rates. And so it's the ones that tend to be BBB, BBB minus and sub-investment grade. Those are the clients that you can help drive internal growth. But let me be very clear that the 50 basis points of increase was not by going lower in the credit cycle on the retail side, but was expanding into other asset types which have a different growth profile than what retail assets do. So what were some of the steps that we took? We obviously went into industrial in a big way. Industrials tend to have, even with investment-grade clients. And at one point, I think virtually all of our clients were investment grade on the industrial side. That's no longer the case as we've matured as a company. But they too tended to give 2%, 2.5% growth. So that was one of the drivers of the change in the growth profile. The second was going into new asset types like data centers, like gaming. Those do also tend to have higher internal growth profile. And the biggest driver of all of this is really the international business where we do find a lot of growth even on the retail side with investment-grade clients. So you might recall that we had -- our first transaction was a $0.5 billion sale leaseback with one of the largest grocers in the UK, and that had a growth profile that far superseded the profile that one can get here in the U.S. So it's a combination of all of these factors, different asset types, international, which has allowed us to grow our internal growth from approximately 1% to approximately 1.5%, and that will continue to be a major focus of our business is to how do we take this profile and grow it by another 50 basis points, perhaps more so that this reliance on external acquisitions continues to be minimized.\nSmedes Rose: Okay. That's super helpful. And then I just wanted to quickly ask you. I think you kind of touched on this, but you said you're going to recycle capital, more than $160 million that you did in 2023. And that's just because you probably have sort of more non-core assets identified with the Spirit acquisition. So that would -- that's what's sort of taking that number up maybe relative to where it's been historically here?\nSumit Roy: Yes. I think one of our comments was that you should expect to see a higher number than the $116 million that we accomplished in 2023. As to the actual number, we will be in a position to share that with you during our first quarter earnings call in May.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Eric Borden with BMO Capital Markets.\nEric Borden: I'm just curious if you could talk about the potential opportunities you're seeing today as it relates to the credit lending platform. And what are the different types of tenant credit in industries that you're targeting today?\nSumit Roy: So Eric, the way we think about the credit business is how can we be a one-stop shop for our clients. Clients with whom we've done traditional sale-leaseback business, that have a need to continue to grow their real estate portfolio. And if there is a disconnect, which we kind of saw last year where what you could get in terms of a sale leaseback in terms of yields versus playing in a much more secured position on a balance sheet and yet get 300, maybe even more basis points of yield on investments, it's a win-win for us as well as for our clients. And they would much rather do business with somebody that they understand and that they have a relationship with, and we can offer more of these products to them and enhance the economics on our transactions. That's really what's going to drive the credit side of our business. Having said that, it's across the board. I think we've talked about doing a credit investment in the gaming side with Blackstone. We've talked about doing an investment on one of the largest grocers in the UK. Again, these are the types of examples that you should continue to see. But we are going to be very selective in terms of who we lend to, given that, that is not a core element of our business.\nEric Borden: That's helpful. And then I just wanted to ask one question on the free cash flow. On the $800 million plus of expected free cash flow for 2024, does that guidance include the potential income generated from holding cash in a money market account?\nJonathan Pong: Eric, it includes everything. So in our AFFO guidance, first of all, all of those outcomes, if we're sitting on cash like we have been, where we're relentless and trying to get as much as we possibly can while it\u2019s there. That flows through to FFO. And then you have to deduct obviously, for the dividend, that in effect is the free cash flow.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies.\nLinda Tsai: Can you just take us through some puts and takes regarding the high and low end of your AFFO per share guidance?\nJonathan Pong: Linda, so on the low end at 413, it's a fairly draconian scenario. You almost have to believe that short-term rates are going to continue to push higher, which we have -- we don't have a crystal ball, but crazy things have happened. It also assumes that there's essentially a shutdown of acquisitions and so you can assume that the $2 billion is something significantly less than that. From the credit loss perspective, I think that's also something that we put in a very, very conservative number that we don't think is likely at all of happening, but it is something that is included from a bad debt perspective. There's also some certain cost elements, things like leasing commissions, things like property expenses that are not reimbursed in G&A. You always want to plan for some negative surprises there. And then in terms of the high end, it contemplates a scenario where the macro environment and the cost of capital environment improves, and we are able to do quite a bit more in terms of investment volume. It also suggests that spreads stay in that 150 and up range. Bad debt expense is something that is closer aligned to where we historically have been as a company, which has been close to 40 basis points of rent when you include the pandemic. Outside of the pandemic, we're probably closer to 25 basis points. And it probably would assume a better outcome for some identified credits that we have in the combined portfolio that naturally, we took a very, very draconian stance on as we're building up the base case for guidance. And it also assumes that the mix of our short-term rates, whether it's in euro commercial paper, whether it's in sterling denominated revolver borrowings or whether it's in USCP, which tends to comprise of every exposure, it assumes that the mix is tilted maybe a little bit more towards the European side. Right now, indicative ECP rates would be in the low 4% range. U.S. indicative rates would be in the mid-5s and then you have sterling at 6%, not on the CP side, but on the revolver side. So these are all the variables that have to hit on the low and high end in order for us to reach those scenarios.\nLinda Tsai: Really helpful. And then just my second question is in your pipeline right now, what percentage is domestic versus international?\nSumit Roy: Well, we don't have -- it's unidentified on the non-development side, which was $1.2 billion. Some of it is identified, but a lot of it is discussions that we\u2019re having both here in the U.S. and in the international markets. And if you look at what we did last year, 35% of everything we did was in the international market, 65% was here locally. That could change because it is such a small number. Based on the discussions today, there could be a lot more on the international side than here, but it\u2019s too early to tell, Linda. If you look at the history, it\u2019s largely been in that 30% to 40% international and 70% to 60%, 60% to 70% U.S. And that\u2019s what we would expect under normalized situation.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Alec Feygin with Baird.\nAlec Feygin: So I have one on income taxes. So for the full year, the year-over-year increase in 2023 was about 15%. And the midpoint of guidance is implying about a 35% year-over-year increase in 2024. Can you provide some more color on what is driving that large increase in income taxes?\nJonathan Pong: Alec, this is really a function of the international business. So the way that we're taxed on that income, it's primarily in the UK. First of all, as a U.S. domiciled company as the 100% owner of the UK, but we are subject to some withholding taxes there. Now what we've done to combat that is we have intercompany loan interest expense and other ways that we can lower taxable income, where the effective tax rate on that NOI is around 11%. But the growth that you see year-over-year is really just a function of the growing platform and portfolio that we have abroad, which is now north of $9 billion. So it shouldn't be a surprise that as the UK grows in particular, you see that line item for income tax start to increase year-over-year. It's something that we obviously take into account in our underwriting and investment committee. It's a factor, obviously, in our long-term IRR underwriting, which is really what dictates the investment decision in most cases. And so it's a known cost that is fully built in to this business model.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Sumit Roy for any closing remarks.\nSumit Roy: Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to seeing many of you at upcoming investor conferences in the Spain. Thanks. Bye.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Sumit Roy",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve, and welcome, everyone. Our fourth quarter and 2023 full-year results demonstrate the unique platform value that Realty Income has built, which differentiates us as a real estate partner to the world's leading companies. During the year, we accomplished several milestones, which illustrate the benefits bestowed to us by our size, scale and relationships. First, we set an annual high in property level investment volume closing on over $9.5 billion in high-quality diversified investments across eight different countries and through 271 discrete transactions at a weighted average cash yield of 7.1%. The year was punctuated with a particularly active fourth quarter as we closed on $2.7 billion of investments at a weighted average cash yield of 7.6%. Our fourth quarter activity included a $527 million sale leaseback transaction with Decathlon, one of the world's leading investment-grade rated sporting goods retailers and included properties located in Germany, France, Spain, Italy and Portugal. Despite a volatile capital markets environment, we achieved an investment spread of approximately 115 basis points in the fourth quarter and approximately 120 basis points in 2023. We were able to achieve these spreads without sacrificing our focus on the quality of real estate or security of cash flow, which is a testament to our experienced team and the merits that sophisticated sellers see in transacting with our platform. Second, during the year we established a presence in the data center sector through a build-to-suit development joint venture with Digital Realty. And we incubated new relationships with blue-chip partners such as Blackstone and the EG Group through large scale investments, including the $950 million investment for a 21.9% stake in the Bellagio and the $1.5 billion sale leaseback involving primarily Cumberland Farm convenience stores. Third, and in addition to the achievements noted above, we also announced the $9.3 billion merger with Spirit Realty Capital in an all-stock transaction in October, which closed subsequent to year-end on January 23. These accomplishments contributed to our 2023 AFFO per share of $4, representing an approximately 7% total operational return for the year, and importantly, together with the Spirit merger, set us up to deliver a compelling earnings growth backdrop in 2024. We believe that the close of the Spirit merger last month along with meaningful debt and equity capital raising activity completed at attractive prices in December and January that Jonathan will describe in more detail, leave us well-positioned to deliver robust growth in 2024. We here initiated an AFFO per share guidance range of $4.13 to $4.21 per share for 2024, which represents an annual growth rate of 4.3% at the midpoint. We believe we can achieve this growth rate without the selling of additional public equity. Inclusive of our dividend, this positions us to deliver a total operational return of more than 10% at the midpoint of the guidance range based on the trading price of our common stock as of February 20, 2024. In addition to the $9.3 billion Spirit merger, we're also providing 2024 acquisitions guidance of approximately $2 billion, which is expected to be fully funded via a combination of our portfolios internally generated cash flow now exceeding $800 million after dividend payments on an annualized basis, as well as approximately $605 million of unsettled ATM proceeds and our $3.7 billion of cash and unutilized availability on our revolving credit facility as of year-end. While we continue to source and review high-quality investment opportunities, we remain highly selective deploying capital only into attractive risk adjusted return opportunities that meet both our near-term and long-term investment spread requirements. Of our $2 billion initial investment volume forecast, approximately half is expected to come in the form of development financing, the vast majority of which is already identified. To reiterate, our favorable return profile in 2024 carries very little execution risk from an investment standpoint, allowing us the flexibility to remain patient, disciplined and opportunistic from a capital deployment standpoint. That said, as we demonstrated during the height of the pandemic, our platform affords us the opportunity to pivot quickly back into growth mode should market conditions change. While we intend to remain disciplined in our investments to ensure appropriate risk-adjusted returns for our investors, we continue to highlight why we are best positioned to capitalize on compelling opportunities over the long term. First, the opportunity to consolidate the fragmented net lease real estate market is vast. We estimate $14 trillion total addressable market in the U.S. and Europe across traditional net lease and emerging verticals like data centers and gaming. Second, we have firmly demonstrated our capabilities deploying capital, having invested $9 billion or more including public M&A in each of the last three years since exiting the pandemic year of 2020. Over this time, we have generated annualized AFFO per share growth of approximately 6% and we have provided a total operational return to stockholders of approximately 10% per year. Looking to 2024 and beyond, we are on track to achieve similar capital deployment and AFFO per share growth objectives this year. We are particularly energized by the prospect to participate meaningfully in verticals like data centers and gaming, where we are seeing opportunities to earn healthy initial yields with attractive contractual rent escalators. Third, the Spirit merger deepens our ability to access capital markets through increased trading volume in our publicly-listed stock, which has averaged more than $400 million of daily trading volume since the Spirit transaction was announced. This places us in the top 150 of S&P 500 companies and is more than 7x the net lease peer average over the same timeframe, leaving us even better situated to fund our business in a highly efficient and non-disruptive manner through our ATM equity program. Fourth, our real estate portfolio is becoming increasingly diversified over time and consists of properties leased to relationship clients representing some of the world's leading companies in their respective industries. Diversified exposure to these clients reinforces the stability of our platform and accordingly are growing monthly dividend payments. Finally, the power of our platform is a crucial differentiator as we leverage our expertise across ownership of over 15,400 properties globally, inclusive of the Spirit portfolio. Our experience managing over 5,900 lease outcomes since 1996 provides learnings that feed into analytic AI tools that provide actionable insights, enabling us to more accurately identify acquisition opportunities and to maximize the value of our existing holdings. Continuing with our key operational results from the fourth quarter, investment volume of approximately $2.7 billion was allocated to high-quality investments at a weighted average cash yield of approximately 7.6%. We completed $1.1 billion of total investment volume internationally at a weighted average cash yield of 7.8%. Investments were made across 119 distinct transactions, including 29 sale leaseback transactions equating to $884 million of volume. Our full year investment activity was $9.5 billion, of which 35% was derived internationally, serving as a testament to the value of our investment platform's global footprint. Included in fourth quarter volume was a loan we made to ASDA stores in the UK at a 10.9% yield. The loan is backed by ownership interests and properties containing grocery stores and supermarkets and was extended as part of a sale leaseback transaction with ASDA. In addition, fourth quarter volume included our previously announced $650 million of preferred equity investment in the Bellagio JV with Blackstone, which earns an 8.1% yield. Similar to the loan investment in ASDA, the Bellagio preferred equity investment was paired with investment in high-quality real estate. For both investments, our ability to offer a broadened suite of capital solutions to clients granted us access to high-quality net lease real estate investments at superior risk adjusted returns than we could have otherwise achieved. These transactions serve as templates for future sale leaseback transactions. Also in the fourth quarter, we made our initial investment in a data center development JV with Digital Realty. The initial $200 million investment represents an 80% equity investment in the venture and is expected to generate a 6.9% initial cash yield, 2% annual rent escalators and a long-term triple-net lease with an S&P 100 investment grade client upon completion. Turning to portfolio operations, same-store rent grew 2.6% in the fourth quarter and 1.9% for the year, benefiting in part from lower net bad debt expense compared to the prior year. On a normalized basis, our contractual rent growth approximates 1.5% on an annual basis based on the current composition of our portfolio. This amount is up over 50 basis points from just five years ago and is a result of an intentional push by our team to generate enhanced organic growth. We remain committed to walking this growth rate higher over time through our deliberate underwriting strategy. Our diligent asset management efforts led to a recapture rate of 103.6% during the quarter and 104.1% for the year excluding the impact of the Cineworld bankruptcy. At year-end, occupancy was 98.6%, a 20 basis point decline from the prior quarter as a result of expected client move outs. I will now turn it over to Jonathan who will add further color to the quarter. Thank you, Jonathan. Before concluding, I would like to extend my immense gratitude to Ron Merriman for his valued service to Realty Income on our Board of Directors the past 19 years. Ron's leadership, guidance and mentorship have been invaluable and we all owe him our sincere thanks. I would also like to extend a warm welcome to Jeff Jacobson, who will be joining our Board. I'm thrilled for all of us at Realty Income to benefit from Jeff's perspective as a former CEO of one of the world's premier global real estate asset management firms, LaSalle Investment Management and in his current role as the Chairman of the Board of Cadillac Fairview Corporation. In conclusion, our results in 2023 underscore the multiple avenues of growth at our disposal in the global commercial real estate industry, including through one-off and portfolio acquisitions, multiple asset types, corporate sale leasebacks, development and joint venture partnerships and via public M&A opportunities. The depth of our platform, team and relationships enable us to leverage some or all of these sourcing avenues concurrently as opportunities arise. In 2023, we completed five transactions greater than $500 million in size and two of which were greater than $1 billion excluding the Spirit merger. These are transactions that Realty Income was uniquely positioned to execute given our size, scale and access to capital globally. These distinct competitive advantages support us in serving as real estate partner to the world's leading companies at an unparalleled scale. Moreover, we believe that serving as capital provider to a diverse spectrum of clients, who are leaders in their respective industries, furthers our core mission to deliver dependable monthly dividends that grow over time. We will now open it up for questions. Thank you for that question, Michael. It's a lot of what you just said. If you look at the market today and you look at the cap rate environment, the adjustments that we have seen has not been commensurate with the movement in the cost of capital. And we are coming out with a business plan that basically says, okay, these two variables that we don't control are not going to be part of how we deliver the 4.3% growth and north of 10% total return growth. And that's the reason for the numbers that we have shared with you. If the cap rates were to adjust, we will be first in line to take advantage of that. If the interest rate environments were to start to go down, which would then have an impact on our cost of capital, i.e., lower cost of capital, we would be first in line to react. We wanted to come out with a business plan that had no reliance on the capital markets on the funding side and come up with a number which we all believe very, very confidently that we will be able to meet, if not exceed. If the environment were to change, i.e., interest rate were to start to go down et cetera, which would have a positive impact on our cost of capital. Do believe that a lot of the conversations that we are having, so it's not the conversations that have dried up, it's the expectation in the market around what the reservation price needs to be that needs to move. And that can happen either through the movement of cap rates or through our cost of capital getting better. And right now, we feel very confident in saying the plan that we have has very little to no risk and we can deliver a 10% plus return without having to be aggressive in the market. And that's really the thesis around what we've come out with. So Michael, the reason I believe that cap rates haven't moved is because of the volatility in the market. If there was certainty that, hey, this cost of capital environment is going to remain at these elevated levels for the next three years, guess what? Cap rates will adjust, will move, and there will be more willingness on the part of the seller to transact today. We had the tenure at a 4.2 towards the end of last year, it dropped down to 3.75 in January, and then it's back up to 4.2. In that sort of environment, you have sellers that are saying, we expect the Fed to start cutting interest rate later in the year. I think it can hold off another six to seven months. So why transact in this environment today? And I think that's the reason why we have hesitation and lack of this widespread movement in cap rates that one would expect if people were to bind to the fact that this cost of capital environment has been permanently impaired. So I think in this scenario that you've sort of dictated, if that were to be the norm and if everybody were to accept that, that, hey, for the next three years, the cost of capital environment is not going to change, I do think transactions are going to come back. I do think cap rates will move much more than they have done so. And yes, we'll be the ones first in line to take advantage of that. Yes, the vast majority of the pipeline are takeouts, Josh. So this is really entering into a forward contract. We are not deploying capital as the assets being developed. And once it's developed and the certificate of occupancy is received, we are essentially buying the asset at that point. And obviously, rent is commencing at that point. So that's how one should think about the development pipeline. Yes. It's just yet another tool that is available to us to drive growth, Josh. That's how we think about development. We have existing client relationships. They have aggressive plans of expansion. They come to us and they say, hey, we are working with this developer. Would you be interested in getting slightly higher yields than what the market would dictate if this asset were available today? And would you lend your balance sheet to help us expand? And that is part of how we are building out our development pipeline because the expectation is that the yield one can generate through development should be superior to what one could get in the transaction market if that asset were fully operational today. That was the thesis. Now obviously, you might see that some of the yields that we have posted on these developments were slightly lower than what we were able to get in the acquisitions market, and this is largely a function of how quickly the cost of capital environment changed and the adjustments that did take place on the cap rate side, but on the way down on the cost of capital side, this will also manifest itself as a positive to what the markets are going to be. So for instance, the types of transactions we are entering into today on the development side, we'll have -- will be reflective of the yield environment today. And if the cost of capital were to improve, let's say, a year from now to 1.5 years from now, when these assets get delivered, there will be a positive spread that you should see on the development yields versus the -- at that time, cap rates that are transacting in the market. So this is really yet another tool. This will never be a dominant part of our business, but it is certainly a tool that if we want to view ourselves as the real estate partners to leading operators. This is a tool that we want to also provide to our clients to help them grow their business. So Josh, I think I tried to hint that on the last conversation when somebody asked about what are you seeing, what's driving the movement in the market. I can tell you that we are continuing to have a multitude of conversations with our clients, where there's a disconnect is what is the price at which they are willing to transact. And that's where the disconnect is. So it's not that suddenly we are not talking to our clients. We, in fact, one of our largest clients, we spoke with them a couple of weeks ago and where the conversation sort of ended was their expectation of cap rates versus what it is that we could -- what it is that we would need to be able to generate the kind of spreads that would allow us to do the transaction. And that's where -- that's the type of conversations we're having. And clearly, if you look at what we did last year, more than five transactions were above $500 million in size, two of which were above $1 billion in size. That's what we can deliver. That's what we can bring to the table. And that's what our clients need are big solutions to big problems. And so yes, when the spigots open and this reservation price is going to be met by our cost of capital, we will be able to take advantage of and build out our pipeline just like we did the last three years. Hi, Nate. So I'm not going to start giving you cap rates on assets that we have closed in the first quarter. Suffice it to say that there have been transactions that we have closed on in the first quarter. It is reflective of some of the comments that we've made. There has been movement in cap rates. You'll see that when we report our first quarter numbers, but the movement in cap rates is not as widespread as we would like to see. It's not reflective of the changes that have occurred in the cost of capital side. So -- but yes, our flow business is ongoing. And we are being a lot more selective about making sure that our spreads are not being compromised just to create volume. And we have the advantage of coming into this year with a business plan that allows us to do that. With regards to occupancy, we have mentioned that it's going to be above 98%. A lot of these were expected, at lease expiration, these were expected vacancies. And we have -- we generally tend to sort of guide to this low 98% occupancy. Part of what makes our business slightly different from perhaps what you see with the other -- with some of our other peers is we actually like to hold on to some of our vacant assets given the ability to reposition these assets and create more economic value. I know that for a long time over the last six quarters, we were hovering around that 99%, which was unusual for us. But we are very comfortable if we believe that we can generate more economic value which supersedes the holding cost of some of these vacant assets by repositioning it, et cetera, we are very comfortable doing so. So the way to think about how we run our business is the normalized level of occupancy should be in this 98.5% ZIP code. This 1.5% is vacancy that we need to be able to execute on the plans that I've just laid out. Yes, that's a great question, Brad. I will tell you that even in Europe, the volume of transactions is a lot lower, again, because of this disconnect between buyers and sellers and what each requires to perpetuate a transaction. However, having said that, we are seeing pockets of opportunities, especially in the UK, where we feel like even in this environment, transactions can get done. And so that, along with the fact that at least in Europe, our cost of debt is significantly lower by 110, 120 basis points. We are continuing to look for opportunities. But the volume being low is not just unique to the U.S. It is across the geographies that we play in. Haendel, thank you for your question. So a couple of points. I've heard a few comments around free cash flow. We are going to generate north of $800 million in free cash flow. If you think about our $2 billion of acquisition guidance, this represents 40% of the total volume. And on a leverage-neutral basis, this represents 60% of the total capital. So to be able to generate 200 basis points on free cash flow is actually you can do deals at 2% cap rates and still generate 200 basis points. But obviously, that's not how we think about our business. And by the way, the 200 basis points that we were able to achieve, I would say now about 3 years ago, 2.5 years ago, that was in an environment where our cost of capital was massively different than what it is today. And being able to generate 200 basis points was not that difficult. On average, from the time we've been tracking spreads, we have always said that the average spread has been 150 basis points. We also want to make it clear that there will be times like last year and the fourth quarter of last year and all of last year where we did 120 basis points, where when you build up a pipeline with a certain backdrop with regards to your cost of capital and the cap rates that you're entering into a contract in. And by the time you close, if your cost of capital environment changes and you're permanently financing it at that point in time, that's precisely what happened all of last year. We had a very robust pipeline and we were entering into contracts with the expectation of not necessarily 200 basis points, but certainly 150 basis points and sometimes well north of that. But by the time we actually permanently finance the transaction, the cost of capital environment was different. And just to make another point, if you actually look at the cost of permanent financing that we ultimately effectuated in 2023, what we locked in, in terms of spread was closer to 140 basis points. It was 136 basis points, I think. So much closer to the average that we have since we've been tracking this particular metric. But I just want to make sure that if the expectation is that in any transaction that we enter into, we're going to try to lock in 200 basis points. That's not how we think about pursuing transactions. We also use a bar build strategy where there might be transactions that are precisely the right investment for us. And if it only creates 100 basis points, we believe that on a risk-adjusted return basis, that is the right profile for that investment, we are comfortable doing that particular investment. But then we will always try to balance it with transactions that have a 200 basis point profile. But that volatility or that spectrum of spreads in this volatile environment is very difficult to predict, which is why we are -- we've come out with the plan that we have, which -- even in this environment, we can still deliver north of 10% without having to rely on the acquisition market. The integration is going very well. We've closed on the transaction on the 23. We are still very excited about the portfolio we've absorbed. As part of this transaction, we've hired eight people from Spirit on a permanent basis. And we have seven people on a temporary basis that are helping us through the integration process over the next six to nine months. In terms of the actual portfolio itself, we have not been surprised by -- now that we control this asset and the portfolio of clients that we are exposed to, we have not been negatively surprised on any front. There have been some positive surprises in terms of resolutions to certain clients where the outcome has been slightly more positive. But I will caution and say that it is still too early to tell. And that is part of the reason why we were very conservative in our underwriting. And what we shared with the market, we felt very comfortable in terms of delivering. But we've also said that it was conservative, and there happens to be upside, which we hope plays out. And if that's the case, we will share that information with you down the road. What we can share with you, Haendel, is the range that we have shared with you accommodates for any level of credit loss that the Spirit portfolio and/or our portfolio would generate. It's all of those things, Spenser. I mean -- I think you've been following us for a while. We are constantly looking for ways to grow our portfolio and we are constantly looking at non-traditional ways to growing our earnings. And that will continue to be a massive focus of ours in 2024. You're absolutely right, part of having to absorb an additional 2,000 assets with 400 new clients, not all new clients, but 400 clients coming from Spirit. There's going to be a fair amount of asset and capital recycling that we would like to also engage in and that is something that the team is very much focused on, trying to take advantage of the time that we have to focus on playing a little bit of defense rather than the offense. But having said all of that, I do believe that this acquisitions environment can change and can change very quickly. And so the rest of the team, the investment team continues to stay in front of the clients, continues to have conversations, continues to be creative about how we could potentially be a solution to our clients. And so despite the guidance of $2 billion, I can tell you there is going to be a lot of work, perhaps even more so this year than last year in terms of creating the right tools, creating the right efficiencies, all of the things that we've sort of had to put a little bit on the back burner given the robustness of the investment environment that we've had over the last three years. So I think all of that will manifest itself in a much more scalable business, and we'll be happy to share some of that as and when we put it to use and actually start to realize some of the scale benefits. We are not waiting on a particular date. There's obviously a priority of assets that we have identified that we don't believe to be core to our overall portfolio. Those are already in the market. And then we are culling through the rest of the portfolio to continue to add to our capital recycling program for 2024. So there isn't a particular target date, but we'll be happy to share with you more on this front during the first quarter earnings when we'll have assumed control of this portfolio for about 2 months and 10 days. Sure. Smedes, your intuition is accurate. In the retail space here in the U.S., when you start to talk to investment-grade clients on the retail side, on retail boxes, that enter into long-term leases, et cetera, it is very difficult to get them to give you what one would consider to be market growth rates. And so it's the ones that tend to be BBB, BBB minus and sub-investment grade. Those are the clients that you can help drive internal growth. But let me be very clear that the 50 basis points of increase was not by going lower in the credit cycle on the retail side, but was expanding into other asset types which have a different growth profile than what retail assets do. So what were some of the steps that we took? We obviously went into industrial in a big way. Industrials tend to have, even with investment-grade clients. And at one point, I think virtually all of our clients were investment grade on the industrial side. That's no longer the case as we've matured as a company. But they too tended to give 2%, 2.5% growth. So that was one of the drivers of the change in the growth profile. The second was going into new asset types like data centers, like gaming. Those do also tend to have higher internal growth profile. And the biggest driver of all of this is really the international business where we do find a lot of growth even on the retail side with investment-grade clients. So you might recall that we had -- our first transaction was a $0.5 billion sale leaseback with one of the largest grocers in the UK, and that had a growth profile that far superseded the profile that one can get here in the U.S. So it's a combination of all of these factors, different asset types, international, which has allowed us to grow our internal growth from approximately 1% to approximately 1.5%, and that will continue to be a major focus of our business is to how do we take this profile and grow it by another 50 basis points, perhaps more so that this reliance on external acquisitions continues to be minimized. Yes. I think one of our comments was that you should expect to see a higher number than the $116 million that we accomplished in 2023. As to the actual number, we will be in a position to share that with you during our first quarter earnings call in May. So Eric, the way we think about the credit business is how can we be a one-stop shop for our clients. Clients with whom we've done traditional sale-leaseback business, that have a need to continue to grow their real estate portfolio. And if there is a disconnect, which we kind of saw last year where what you could get in terms of a sale leaseback in terms of yields versus playing in a much more secured position on a balance sheet and yet get 300, maybe even more basis points of yield on investments, it's a win-win for us as well as for our clients. And they would much rather do business with somebody that they understand and that they have a relationship with, and we can offer more of these products to them and enhance the economics on our transactions. That's really what's going to drive the credit side of our business. Having said that, it's across the board. I think we've talked about doing a credit investment in the gaming side with Blackstone. We've talked about doing an investment on one of the largest grocers in the UK. Again, these are the types of examples that you should continue to see. But we are going to be very selective in terms of who we lend to, given that, that is not a core element of our business. Well, we don't have -- it's unidentified on the non-development side, which was $1.2 billion. Some of it is identified, but a lot of it is discussions that we're having both here in the U.S. and in the international markets. And if you look at what we did last year, 35% of everything we did was in the international market, 65% was here locally. That could change because it is such a small number. Based on the discussions today, there could be a lot more on the international side than here, but it's too early to tell, Linda. If you look at the history, it's largely been in that 30% to 40% international and 70% to 60%, 60% to 70% U.S. And that's what we would expect under normalized situation. Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to seeing many of you at upcoming investor conferences in the Spain. Thanks. Bye."

            "name": "Jonathan Pong",
            "content": "Thank you, Sumit. We completed an active quarter in the capital markets during the fourth quarter raising $1.6 billion of equity at a weighted average price of $56.25. Including activity subsequent to year-end, we currently have approximately $605 million of outstanding forward equity available to finance a portion of our equity needs in 2024. When combined with over $800 million of annual free cash flow available to us following the Spirit merger, we have the ability to finance all of our equity needs for our $2 billion investments guidance without having to tap into the public equity markets for the remainder of 2024. And this is before any capital recycling opportunities throughout the sales, which we expect to be north of the $116 million volume we achieved in 2023. As Sumit mentioned earlier, our AFFO per share guidance midpoint implies 4.3% annual growth and assumes only $2 million of investments volume, with almost half are re-accounted for in our development pipeline. From a debt capital market standpoint, we de-risked our 2024 maturity schedule through approximately $2.2 billion of bond issuance activity in a 45-day span, beginning with our GBP 750 million sterling notes offering in December and culminating in our US$1.25 billion offering that closed last month. Combined, the two offerings blend to a weighted average tenure of approximately 10.2 years and weighted average yield to maturity of approximately 5.5%. Near-term, these two offerings allow us to fund our business given our current investment outlook without needing to tap into the debt capital markets in 2024, which we believe was a prudent approach given the persistent instability that has permeated the capital markets over the last two years. There are also longer term strategic considerations that dictated this approach. Following our debut euro offerings in the summer of 2023, we believe these offerings also support our steadfast desire to maintain investor diversification across our multi currency debt complex, while pocketing future debt repayment risk in years with meaningful capacity. Last month, we also exercised the first of two one-year extension options available to us on our $1.1 billion multi currency term loan that we established in January of 2023. In conjunction with the extension, we entered into a two-year floating to fixed interest rate swap that effectively locked in a fixed rate of approximately 4.85% on this principle through its maturity date in January 2026. In conjunction with the closing of the Spirit merger, we also assumed $1.3 billion of term loan debt from Spirit, as well as $1.3 billion in existing floating to fixed interest rate swaps, which resulted in an effective weighted average fixed rate of 3.9% on that debt. Of this term loan principal, $800 million matures in 2025 and $500 million matures in 2027. Moving on to key credit metrics at year end, we finished the year with net debt to annualized pro form EBITDA of 5.5x, in line with our targeted leverage ratio and this excludes the $605 million of outstanding forward equity we currently have available to us. Our fixed charge coverage finished the year at 4.7x, which was the high watermark for us in 2023, benefiting from higher investment yields in the fourth quarter and less and lower cost short-term borrowings outstanding. In 2024, we do anticipate an increase of $45 million in annualized non-cash interest expense we expect to recognize from the amortization of below market debt on the Spirit debt we assumed. Note that this non-cash interest expense adjustment does lower annual FFO per share run rate by approximately $0.05 per share, but is not reflected in AFFO, thus explaining the primary reason why our initial FFO and AFFO guidance ranges are more closely bound than in 2023. We would note that purchase price accounting adjustments are ongoing for the merger and thus straight line rents and FAS 141 adjustments from the merger are likely to push FFO higher once finalized, and we will adjust our FFO guidance at that time. Of course, these are non-cash adjustments that do not impact AFFO. Looking forward, I would like to reiterate Sumit's opening comments about our lack of reliance on the capital markets to fund our growth in 2024. From a liquidity perspective, we view our near-term capital availability as a strength of following our bond yield last month, we had into the rest of 2024 with approximately $4 billion of liquidity at year-end, variable rate debt representing less than 5% of our total debt capital stack and no capital market execution risk to fund our growth for the remainder of 2024. With that, I'll turn it back over to Sumit for closing remarks. Josh, this is Jonathan. One way to think about it because the answer is really going to vary depending on the lease. But if we're doing a development takeout, obviously, we put the funds down when the project is done, we get those assets and the rent starts and there's really no lag. If it's a development build-to-suit we're funding along the way. A little bit more nuance associated with that, where you're not quite getting the economics that we are entitled to as we put this funding out. However, from an accounting standpoint, the way that it flows through to the income statement is through essentially our cost of short-term debt. And so from a modeling perspective, the most clean way to do it, in my view, would be to just assume when you see us developing and deploying capital, that's when the yield begins because in most cases, that's going to be the case. Brad, there's always going to be a fair amount of conservatism sitting here in mid-February on line items like that. We did have quite a bit of growth from a resource standpoint in the back half of 2023, you're going to see the full annualized effect of that. And it's still too early to tell on the synergies front with Spirit, what ultimately is going to be achievable, but in the first month or so less than that of ownership, everything is trending to better than we expected from a synergy standpoint. And as a reminder, on a cash basis, we expected $30 million of synergies off of a $40 million cash G&A load annualized. So we're hopeful, but look, we're trying to create a platform. We're trying to refine certain areas of the business, but we're really trying to resource with everything going on, all of our groups to create this moat, if you will, that can persist for a long time. So with that comes a little bit of investment in things like technology and in people. So that's really the driver of that. Eric, it includes everything. So in our AFFO guidance, first of all, all of those outcomes, if we're sitting on cash like we have been, where we're relentless and trying to get as much as we possibly can while it's there. That flows through to FFO. And then you have to deduct obviously, for the dividend, that in effect is the free cash flow. Linda, so on the low end at 413, it's a fairly draconian scenario. You almost have to believe that short-term rates are going to continue to push higher, which we have -- we don't have a crystal ball, but crazy things have happened. It also assumes that there's essentially a shutdown of acquisitions and so you can assume that the $2 billion is something significantly less than that. From the credit loss perspective, I think that's also something that we put in a very, very conservative number that we don't think is likely at all of happening, but it is something that is included from a bad debt perspective. There's also some certain cost elements, things like leasing commissions, things like property expenses that are not reimbursed in G&A. You always want to plan for some negative surprises there. And then in terms of the high end, it contemplates a scenario where the macro environment and the cost of capital environment improves, and we are able to do quite a bit more in terms of investment volume. It also suggests that spreads stay in that 150 and up range. Bad debt expense is something that is closer aligned to where we historically have been as a company, which has been close to 40 basis points of rent when you include the pandemic. Outside of the pandemic, we're probably closer to 25 basis points. And it probably would assume a better outcome for some identified credits that we have in the combined portfolio that naturally, we took a very, very draconian stance on as we're building up the base case for guidance. And it also assumes that the mix of our short-term rates, whether it's in euro commercial paper, whether it's in sterling denominated revolver borrowings or whether it's in USCP, which tends to comprise of every exposure, it assumes that the mix is tilted maybe a little bit more towards the European side. Right now, indicative ECP rates would be in the low 4% range. U.S. indicative rates would be in the mid-5s and then you have sterling at 6%, not on the CP side, but on the revolver side. So these are all the variables that have to hit on the low and high end in order for us to reach those scenarios. Alec, this is really a function of the international business. So the way that we're taxed on that income, it's primarily in the UK. First of all, as a U.S. domiciled company as the 100% owner of the UK, but we are subject to some withholding taxes there. Now what we've done to combat that is we have intercompany loan interest expense and other ways that we can lower taxable income, where the effective tax rate on that NOI is around 11%. But the growth that you see year-over-year is really just a function of the growing platform and portfolio that we have abroad, which is now north of $9 billion. So it shouldn't be a surprise that as the UK grows in particular, you see that line item for income tax start to increase year-over-year. It's something that we obviously take into account in our underwriting and investment committee. It's a factor, obviously, in our long-term IRR underwriting, which is really what dictates the investment decision in most cases. And so it's a known cost that is fully built in to this business model."

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tyler Grant, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nTyler Grant: Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income\u2019s third quarter operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jonathan Pong, Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Finance. During this conference call, we will make statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. The Company\u2019s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the Company\u2019s Form 10-Q. We\u2019ll be observing a two-question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you would like to ask additional questions, you may reenter the queue. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy.\nSumit Roy: Thank you, Tyler, and welcome, everyone. We are proud of the solid execution we've delivered on our strategy in the third quarter and maintain a favorable outlook for our business. Our One Team at Realty Income continues to work diligently toward delivering strong results to our clients and stakeholders. The resilience, tenacity and range of our One Team has been impressive, culminating in the signing of the merger agreement with Spirit Realty, which we announced last week. This followed a quarter in which we invested $2 billion in high-quality acquisitions, raised over $2 billion in long-term and permanent capital, re-leased 284 properties at a 106.9% recapture rate, supporting an increase to our 2023 AFFO per share guidance range, which now stands at $3.98 to $4.01. I would like to thank our One Team for their leadership efforts and dedication on behalf of all of whom we serve. Our third quarter results demonstrate the consistency of our earnings profile through varying economic environments and the attractive internal growth of our high-quality real estate portfolio, while highlighting the capabilities of our One Team and platform. Notwithstanding the challenging capital markets backdrop, AFFO per share grew 4.1% from last year to $1.02 per share. Combined with our dividend, we are pleased to have delivered an annualized total operational return up approximately 9%. As announced last week, we entered into a definitive merger agreement with Spirit Realty in an all-stock transaction valued at $9.3 billion. The deal is expected to be immediately accretive to AFFO per share on a leverage-neutral basis without requiring any external capital to fund the merger. The accretion from the transaction once completed creates the foundation for AFFO per share growth in the coming year and puts us in a unique situation where we've had good visibility to an attractive forward earnings growth rate potential two months prior to the start of the new year. Given that that of course remains a fair amount of uncertainty in the capital markets environment, the accretion from the Spirit transaction is made more compelling given the lack of capital markets risk we are absorbing to effectuate this outcome. In fact, we believe our conservative underwriting of the portfolio provides for meaningful upside potential to our headline accretion expectations. We believe Spirit's portfolio is complementary to ours and we help to further diversify our industry, client and property concentrations. We expect our increased size diversification, trading liquidity and overall presence in the market will enable us to access the capital markets even more efficiently, while also improving our ability to digest larger deals without creating concentration issues within our portfolio. We are excited about the attractive cost basis, earnings accretion and enhanced ability to buy in bulk that will be effectuated through this transaction. I would like to express great appreciation for the Spirit and Realty Income teams, given their hard work and collaboration, which enabled us to successfully progress the transaction. In the third quarter, we invested approximately $2 billion in high-quality real estate investments, leased to a diversified group of clients at a 6.9% initial cash yield. $1.4 billion of this total was derived from the international business at a 6.9% yield. Investments in the quarter were made across 132 discrete transactions. I would highlight that our volume include 34 sale-leaseback transactions for $1.3 billion of volume and six deals that were greater than $50 million in size. This demonstrates that both the corporate sale leaseback and larger transaction initiatives remained advantageous for us during the quarter. A testament to our ability to source, negotiate and close on transactions that are less trafficked amongst other net lease companies both public and private. Our investment activity year-to-date is $6.8 billion, with investments in international markets representing approximately one-third of this total. Investment spreads realized during the quarter were over 100 basis points when calculating our WACC on a leverage-neutral basis and using the cost of equity and debt actually executed during the quarter. This is a decline of 30 basis points from last quarter, which is a result of the significant increase in the cost of capital \u2013 felt across the capital markets in a short amount of time. To put it into context, the average 10-year yield increased by approximately 55 basis points from Q2 to Q3. Following the sharp changes in the public debt and equity markets during the quarter, the private market cap rates have not adequately adjusted. Accordingly, we believe that it is particularly important to be disciplined and patient allocators of capital and ensuring that we are appropriately compensated for the capital we provide. We are confident in our ability to source and allocate capital and scale and with efficiency and we are deeply focused on delivering attractive risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders. Given the level of transactions completed in the first three quarters of the year, combined with an outlook for narrowed investment spreads, we are modestly increasing our investment guidance to approximately $9 billion for 2023, which excludes the Spirit transaction that is anticipated to close in 2024. This increased target reflects deals that we already had in the closing pipeline prior to the recent surge in our cost of capital. With the sharp recent changes in cost of capital, we remain highly selective in pursuing new investment opportunities and will assertively hold the line on entering into any new transactions unless we can be assured of generating ample spreads to our cost of capital. From an operating perspective, our portfolio continues to be healthy and performed well. At the end of the quarter occupancy was 98.8%. This is down slightly from last quarter's historically high occupancy level of 99% and it is a result of expected client move-outs. Rent recapture rates across 284 new and renewed leases was 106.9%. This outcome is better than our historical average of 102.3% and results in year-to-date rent recapture of 104.3% on 661 new and renewed leases. I would highlight that since 1996 we have managed over 5,300 lease expirations. And the improving recapture rates in recent years is a testament to our asset management expertise and the unparalleled historical data we have at our disposal. This competitive advantage enhances the quality of our asset management decisions through unique insights gleaned from our proprietary data analytics platform. Our credit watchlist represents 2.5% of our annualized base rent as of the end of the quarter. This is a decline of 120 basis points from the second quarter and is primarily the result of removing Cineworld from the watch list following our amendment, which became effective on October 1. We recovered 60% of prior base rent on our 41 locations without any capital contributions. Importantly we also negotiated the ability to recover rent through percentage rent agreements which could give us the ability to recapture a total of 70% of prior rent based on our internal estimates of performance. Finally with the reinvestment of certain asset sales we expect to recapture a total of approximately 85% of prior rent. Same-store rent grew at an elevated rate of 2.2%. We continue to generate increasing higher average rent escalators within the portfolio due to our commitment to investing in leases with stronger rent escalators, particularly, in international markets where we have a relatively outsized number of leases with uncapped inflation escalators. The better-than-expected same-store rent growth in the quarter has enabled us to raise our full year guidance to approximately 1.5%. With that I would like to turn the call over to Jonathan.\nJonathan Pong: Thank you, Sumit. Discipline and a commitment to our A3/A minus- credit ratings continue to be our priorities from a balance sheet management perspective. During the third quarter our net debt to annualized pro forma adjusted EBITDA and fixed charge coverage ratios each fell by 10% to 5.2 times and 4.5 times, respectively. In the third quarter we issued $886 million of equity primarily through our ATM program while ending the quarter with $749 million of unsettled forward equity outstanding. Combined with cash on hand with $344 million, the net availability on our credit facility of $3.4 billion we ended the quarter with $4.5 billion of liquidity. As we look forward to future capital raising needs we continue to have rate protection on $1 billion of notional value to hedge against a rising 10-year yield. We purchased this protection in the form of a derivative instrument called a swaption corridor, which effectively limits our rate exposure on a future note issuance at an option premium below the cost of a regular way vanilla option. We purchased this option in late March when a 10-year yield was in the 3.5% area. And as of quarter end the net value of the swaptions had a mark-to-market value of approximately $25 million. As Sumit mentioned previously, the Spirit transaction provides us with the opportunity for meaningful earnings accretion in the coming years. From a balance sheet perspective, the Spirit team has done a great job in curating a well-laddered debt maturity schedule, which limits our future refinancing risk in any given year. As we have experienced throughout the company's history, the global rate environment provides both headwinds and tailwinds in any given year, which is why the assumption of balance fixed rate debt stack that is spread fairly ratably from 2025 through 2032 and provides us with extended financial benefits with manageable refinancing risk. When giving effect to the combined debt maturity stack, we estimate that there will not be a year when more than 12% of our total fixed rate debt comes due. Similar to the complementary real estate portfolio, Spirits debt stack is also a good fit with our existing maturity schedule, and we expect the continued debt stack or the combined debt stack to remain well laddered giving us numerous opportunities to engage in opportunistic liability management exercises when -- and economically advantageous to do so. When I finally I would like to thank all of our team members who have worked so incredibly hard in helping to support this transaction, and we will continue to be integral as we move towards close and integration. With that, I would like to turn it back to Sumit.\nSumit Roy : Thank you, Jonathan. In conclusion as further demonstrated in the quarter, Realty Income has a well-established growth-focused business model that provides stable and predictable cash flows to fund the payout of our monthly dividend. We believe the platform we have created, evolved and refined is not easily replicable. We have a long history of prudently allocating capital that is complemented by our industry-leading capital leasing abilities that we used to invest across properties that fall within our well-defined investment criteria. The results of our efforts have produced our net lease portfolio that consists of more than 13,200 properties diversified across property types industries, geographies and clients. We're excited for the future of our business. Our anticipated acquisition of Spirit provides a solid building block for growth, as we head into 2024 and our existing portfolio continues to perform well. As such we find ourselves in a favorable position to produce high single or low double-digit operational returns, while offering the same stability that has defined this platform for decades. At this time we can open it up for questions. Operator?\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Joshua Dennerlein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Yeah. Hey, guys. Thanks for the time. Maybe just going back to some of the opening remarks on the re-leasing the spreads. Just curious what drove that historically better than or the re-leasing spread is better than the historical run rate? And then just how should we think about that going forward?\nSumit Roy: Yeah. Great question, Josh. A lot of this was driven by our non-retail re-leasings. And you can see the breakout I think we provide that in the supplemental, it was closer to 140% in terms of re-leasing spreads. It was also largely driven by this one very large industrial distribution center that we released to a new client. If you looked at just the retail side of the equation that was closer to 104% which is still slightly better than average. And I think a lot of this is really what I said in my opening remarks, the more assets we control the kind of conversations that we can enter into with our clients is a different one. One of the largest renewals was Circle K and where we looked at 100 of their assets and we're able to enter into long-term lease discussions at very favorable rates. And that is what makes this platform so unique. The fact that we do control so many assets for some of these clients, the discussion we can have where, if there is an asset that's not performing well we are more than willing to give them a rent haircut, but make that more than up across the portfolio and come up with a win-win situation for both parties. And again, it's all about size and scale, but I'd be remiss, if I don't compliment the asset management team, the predictive analytics team that continues to refine the models and give scores on each asset, which gives the asset management team the confidence to then go in and negotiate knowing that these are assets that are performing well and therefore warrant an increase. So I think it's a combination of all of those factors Joshua that we were able to realize 106.9% re-leasing spreads.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Appreciate that color. Maybe just stepping back, how do you think about like your strategy? Is it something you want to lean into or you can try to get assets that get better internal growth going forward? Just curious.\nSumit Roy: Yeah. Obviously, what this is implying Josh is that, if there are assets that we believe based on some of the things that I just shared with you that we can do better than the current in-place rent. We are going to take a bit of a different stance and try to take control of those assets, especially if the existing client is looking for a rent haircut et cetera. Which obviously we may have a bit of a negative drag on occupancy levels, because we want to take control and despite our best efforts sometimes when you take control, there's a bit of a lag time between getting this new client into this building at that elevated rents. But for us, the bottom line is going to be about creating better economics on rent recapture and at a small expense on the occupancy side, if that's what's going to be needed to do that. So going forward, you will see us continue to push this strategy and continue to show to the market that we do have a differentiated asset management platform.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Got it. Thanks for the time.\nSumit Roy: Thank you, Josh.\nOperator: The next question comes from Nate Crossett with BNP. Please go ahead.\nNate Crossett: Hey good afternoon. Maybe you could just talk about the current pipeline. What do the yields look like right now? And then also how big is the Spirit pipeline? What do those yields look like?\nSumit Roy: Yes, I'm not going to speak to Spirit because it's not a transaction that we've closed on yet. So, I'll speak very much to the pipeline that we have made. And as you can tell we obviously have a very healthy pipeline. We just increased the acquisitions to approximately $9 billion, which is an increase from where we were at the end of the third quarter. And again these are very similar to what we showed you in the third quarter. If you look at some of the largest transactions we did they were with grocery operators in the UK, it was ASDA and Morrisons, both names that we like and we're able to get these very large transactions as I believe was close to a $900 million transaction. Morrisons slightly smaller closer to $170 million sale-leaseback. Both of these were sale-leasebacks and done purely on a negotiated basis. That type of transaction is what you're going to see when we get those over the finish line in the fourth quarter. Those are the types of transactions that we have in our pipeline today. Some of the comments I've made around cap rates moving but not moving commensurate with our cost of capital movement remains true. The other piece that I will overlay is the fact that some of these transactions that we have in our pipeline were created six to nine months ago. And so people may have questions, how come you were only able to get a 6.9% cash cap rate which by the way if you look at it on a straight-line basis it's almost 8.1% and just given the inherent growth in these leases and to make it equivalent to some of the other data that is shown by some of our peers. Has the growth profile that we are targeting but potentially is not reflective? Which was obviously shown in the spreads that we were able to recapture 105 basis points, which is about 30 basis points inside of what we did in the second quarter. And that goes to the point I'm making is that cap rates though adjusting are adjusting much, much more slowly than our cost of capital. And so this is a time where going forward we are going to be hyper selective. But the makeup of the fourth quarter will be very similar. You should see a movement in cap rates in the right direction, i.e. higher cap rates and more reflective of when these transactions were essentially came on to the pipeline which started to reflect the more rapid movement in our cost of capital. So, that's what you should see. It's obviously fairly healthy. But thankfully we've raised a fair amount of capital through the ATM et cetera already.\nNate Crossett: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Just one on the Bellagio I just wanted to ask like what is your appetite to do investments where you don't own the asset 100%. whether it's a JV or a loan? And is there anything in the pipeline that is a JV?\nSumit Roy: Off the top of my head, outside of the Bellagio transaction, I don't believe we have a JV structure in the pipeline. Similar to the way we structured the Bellagio transaction, we do tend to have JVs with developers where they hold on to a small stake in the development while developing the assets, et cetera, but we generally tend to be the takeout on the back end. But I don't think Nate and correct me if I'm wrong, that you meant those types of JVs. You were talking about more permanent JV structures like the one that we've entered into with Bellagio. I don't believe we have one like that. There is one -- there are products out there by the way, that do lend themselves to this JV structure. There are asset classes that require a tremendous amount of capital, where we will be more than forthcoming about entering into a JV just given the sheer amount of capital required. But those are going to be very specific to a very specific asset type, and I would put casinos in that bucket and perhaps some other asset types that lends itself to this. But as of right now, we don't have other JVs that we've entered into.\nNate Crossett: Okay. So like what are the other asset types like, would data centers be on that list? I'm just curious.\nSumit Roy: Yes. Data centers is certainly an asset type that will require based on this influx of AI, et cetera. It's an asset type that will have a massive requirement in terms of capital. I could see, if we choose to go into that area, that's an area that JV-ing with an operator would make perfect sense.\nNate Crossett: Okay. Thank you. \nOperator: The next question comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho. Please go ahead. \nQ \u2013 Haendel St. Juste: Hey, I guess it's still good morning out there to you. So Sumit, I guess first question for you is on the composition of the transaction in the third quarter. The share of Europe was historically high. The high-grade share and cap rates, seemed low. Understanding there is a little bit of a lag at least on the cap rate. But I guess, I'm curious if you can help us square some of that and maybe perhaps offer any commentary or facts and figures that would help ease any concern regarding the quality of the assets you're buying? And if we should expect Europe to continue playing a greater role near term? Thanks.\nSumit Roy: Sure. So you tell me, if buying Asda and Morrisons is diluting the quality of the asset pool at realty income handle. I think we've tried to answer this question before that, we do not target investment grade. What we are looking for are assets that we believe, are priced and have a profile of generating a return that is on a risk-adjusted basis, the right return profile. That is how we think about the world. And the fact that, we are able to enter into these negotiated transactions, with some of the best operators in UK. I think is something we are very comfortable doing. And the fact that they don't have a an investment-grade rating is not an issue for us given how we were able to price it, the fact that these are top quartile assets that we were able to get and have inherent growth profiles that will continue to pay dividend in years to come. So for us, it's looking at the entire investment in totality. To determine how much risk are we really taking on? What is the operator? Where are they in terms of positioning? How are they positioned within that particular sector? What is the actual real estate that we are getting? What is the performance of the four wall? I think those are the things that we focus on. And the fact that they turn out to be investment grade or not, is almost a byproduct of that analysis rather than something that we target. And I think I've said this before but thank you for asking the question. I'll keep repeating this. I believe we had about 20% of our investments this quarter that was investment grade. But again that could be in some quarters 40%, in some quarters it could even be less than that. And we will, of course, continue to share that information with you but a portfolio that on a straight-line basis generates north of 8% yield, I think is something that we are very proud of Haendel.\nHaendel St. Juste: Okay. Certainly appreciate that. And maybe one follow-up perhaps for Jon, a question on the reserves. I think there's been about $11 million of reserve reversal year-to-date. Can you clarify what's assumed in the 4Q guide, which includes the Cineworld restructuring and if we should expect any reversals in 2024? Thanks.\nJonathan Pong: No, nothing that you should expect for the fourth quarter, pretty much all of the reserve reversals that were significant have been taken as of the third quarter. You may have seen in our same-store rent growth slide in the supplement that we saw a bit of a bump in health and fitness and that was really related to one more regional client that we reserved or refers to reserve off of. As we look forward into 2024, nothing lumpy from that standpoint that would be on the radar as we think about just bad debt expense in general, modeling out the following year we always have some semblance of an unidentified reserve that we put in there just given our history. And we're obviously very conservative on that front. And I think we've said this before, but we've historically realized about a 25 basis point credit loss in the portfolio at any given year.\nHaendel St. Juste: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please go ahead.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Assuming you used the term hyper selective in terms of how you're going to approach the next year, can you define what hyper selective means? And does that mean that you would only look at for opportunities greater than the 100 basis point of investment trends that you saw this quarter? Thanks.\nSumit Roy: That's a great question, Michael. Look, I think if you look at where we are today and you look a year ahead in 2024, we believe that without having to rely on the equity capital markets, we'll be able to deliver approximately 4% to 5% AFFO per share growth. And that is a pretty powerful statement to make and that obviously assumes that the Spirit transaction closes either in the first month, either in January or in February. And with just the free cash flow that we are going to generate pro forma, which is going to be right around $800 million, some of the headwinds that we are going to experience in the refinancing, absorbing all of that to be able to sit here today and say that we could deliver that growth without having to raise $1 of equity. I think it's a very good place to be. And so when I said about being hyper selective, what has happened more recently is that the cost of capital has moved so dramatically, so quickly that the cap rates haven't had a chance to sort of adjust. And so we find ourselves in this \u2013 like I said in the second quarter, we had about 135 basis points of spread. And then in this quarter we have 105 basis points of spread. It's a tough environment to be in when we are entering into transactions six months, seven months in advance of closing a transaction and the cap rate environment \u2013 I mean the cost of capital environment changes and when you are permanently financing it, it sort of eats into what you had originally underwritten. That is what I meant when I said, we want to be hyper selective because we want to help drive the cap rates out to help accommodate for these unforeseen movements in the cost of capital. And so clearly the cap rates haven't adjusted as much and that's what I said that's what I mean when I say we want to be hyper selective. We want to wait for the cap rates to adjust to make sure that we can get the spreads that we have historically achieved. That was really the color behind that comment.\nMichael Goldsmith: That's really helpful. And then as I follow up, occupancy took a slight step back but still well above your guidance range. So can you just talk about what you're seeing in the market in terms of pushing rents versus occupancy and how you use that to drive or maximize revenue overall?\nSumit Roy: Sure. That's a great follow-on question, Michael. So for us we are looking at a particular real estate through the lens of maximizing revenue. And the revenue maximization strategy by its very definition will mean that we are more than comfortable holding on to certain assets that are vacant for longer. If we have concluded that there is a use for that particular location and that it's not the very first client that comes in and gives us a rent proposal. But the kind of client that we are targeting and the client and a profile of rent that we are targeting that takes time. And so we are more than comfortable taking a little bit of a hit on the occupancy side to make sure that we get the best revenue optimization for that given location. And that's what you're going to see. That's the reason why even though we've been running the portfolio at 99% for the last three quarters, we have always maintained that our occupancy is going to be up slightly above 98%. Because that we believe is a natural state of occupancy for the business model that we are trying to run here. And look, where it makes sense, we will continue to sell assets vacant, if we believe that that is the most economically desirable outcome that holding on to those assets does have a cost and that just continues to drag into the return profile. So selling assets vacant is also a strategy that we will continue to implement. So I just don't want you to start thinking now in terms of, hey, there will be no more vacant asset sales. All of those options are available to us and we will pursue the one that generates the best revenue outcome.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nBrad Heffern: Hi, everybody. Sumit, the European deal volume was a record this quarter after a period of time where it seemed like the region was maybe a bit slower to reflect the new reality. I'm wondering if Europe is back to competing for capital on sort of a heads-up basis with the US or if this was just a one-off where you happen to have two large deals get over the finish line at the same time?\nSumit Roy: We've been talking about these two transactions for a while now, Brad. So, some of it's just taken a little bit longer to get this over the finish line. And some of it has been that cap rates do take a little bit longer to adjust in the international markets than they do here just because of the depth of the market here. You should continue to see a fair amount of product coming in from the international markets and that's reflected in our pipeline. But I always go back to when somebody asks at the beginning of the year where do you think you're going to end up? We always say that it's right around that 30% to 40% will be the international investments. And 60% to 70% will be the US And I think that is probably where we'll end up at the end of the year as well.\nBrad Heffern: Okay. Got it. And then can you talk broadly about the attractiveness of the different capital sources. The $750 million in unsettled equity isn't quite as much as I would have thought given you have the $3-plus billion to close by the end of the year. But I'm wondering if you're shifting to maybe a greater debt balance given where the relative costs of capital are.\nJonathan Pong: Hey Brad, it's Jonathan. So, all options are available to us. Obviously, each one of them on a nominal or absolute basis isn't where we would want it to be. But I think the one thing to consider is we're always going to prioritize that 5.5 times leverage first and foremost. And so when you look at our equity costs, you compare it to our indicative cost of 10-year unsecured debt across all three currencies that we can operate in. There is a difference that isn't necessarily wider than usual but there is a bit of a gap but we aren't going to sacrifice the balance sheet we are going to lever up just to eke out a couple of extra 10th of a basis point of growth for next year. So you could expect us to be very predictable from that standpoint and by predictable, it's carrying a reasonable balance on the line in our CP program having 10% or so of variable rate debt outstanding at any point in time and being very prudent with laddering out our maturities on a go-forward basis.\nBrad Heffern: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Eric Wolfe with Citi. Please go ahead.\nEric Wolfe: Hey. Thanks. With regard to the Cineworld agreement, can you talk about whether that helped your guidance relative to what you were forecasting before and remind us how much income you booked on Cineworld prior to October 1, just so we can understand the incremental impact for next year?\nSumit Roy: Yeah. Everything that we've shared with you on Cineworld is obviously in the form of an agreement. So any impact that, it's going to have is reflected in the comments that we've made about next year and the fourth quarter of this year. Eric, I don't know if you're looking for anything more that we are not expecting to give you a surprise that because of the Cineworld transaction there's going to be a drag on anything that we've shared with you. That's already been absorbed and shared. It's reflected in the updated guidance that we have for 2023 and in the comments that I've made about what we expect to see happen in 2024.\nEric Wolfe : And then in the second quarter so I guess not the third quarter but the second quarter you saw around $0.5 billion increase in financing receivables within other assets. Is that more a reflection of the type of deals that were done in that quarter or rents were on those deals relative to the market? Just wondering whether we should expect a similar jump in the third quarter and sort of the quarters going forward?\nJonathan Pong: Hi, Eric. That's really driven by the accounting guidance where when you have sale-leaseback transactions and you look at the rent relative to market, the classification of that revenue goes into a different bucket it goes into other revenues and also the corresponding balance sheet impact also will show up there. So it's no different than any other regular way transaction we do it's just given the nature of it being a sale-leaseback deal with the purchase price accounting that's dictating some of the valuation associated, with the real estate versus the cash flow and that's why you see that as that bump.\nEric Wolfe: Okay. Right. So any type of sale leaseback would create sort of more outsized impact on financing receivables versus another type of deal. I'm just understanding that correctly?\nJonathan Pong: Yes.\nEric Wolfe: Okay. All right. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Wes Golladaywith Baird. Please go ahead.\nWes Golladay: Hey, everyone. I'm just curious what are the clients saying right now? I assume, you're still the cheapest form of capital for them. Are they just looking to pause and to see where rates settle?\nSumit Roy: Yes, this is an ongoing debate. The clients tend to think about the world 12 months ago and we are trying to get them to understand the world has changed dramatically. It is that stickiness that causes the cap rate movements to drag and that's no different today. What we are seeing, however is that, when there is pressure on the client i.e. there's a maturity that they have to deal with on the debt side or they have a pipeline that is helping drive their growth and they have to build out assets or operate assets. That's where we see a willingness to transact and accommodate the new cost of capital environment. But it depends on the client it depends on the sophistication of the client it depends on the need and the urgency that the client is experiencing at that point in time where these conversations are either fairly straightforward and easy or there's a bit of a delta between what they're expecting and hoping versus what we can deliver.\nWes Golladay: Okay. Thanks for the time.\nSumit Roy: Sure.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ron Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRon Kamdem: Hey, the first couple of quick ones. Just back on tenant health, I'm looking at the supplement in this I see rent coverage is 2.8. Just wondering, does the Cineworld transaction sort of -- is that going to hit that number next quarter? Number one. And then if you could just broadly talk about just what are you seeing in terms of tenant health in sort of sectors or areas where you're starting to see some softness or any areas that are outperforming? Thanks.\nSumit Roy: Ron, so the Cineworld will not have an impact on the four-wall coverage, because we don't get store-specific on a quarter-by-quarter basis. That number that we share with you our own assets where we do have a fair amount of visibility with regards to four-wall coverage. So when we have assets that have a point in time disclosure, we generally don't try to include that, so no, it won't have an impact. With regards to what we are seeing that 2.8 to 2.9 has been a fairly consistent number over the last call it three quarters. And it was a bit surprising all of last year because the cost of capital has started moving and we were expecting there to be a little bit more noise and what we ended up learning through the processes even the reserves that we had created we had to sort of unwind to reflect that the clients were doing better than what we had expected. And that theme has sort of played out. There are certainly some bankruptcies in the casual dining side, on the franchisee side that they are such a small portion of our overall portfolio. I am talking single digit basis points that they don\u2019t have much of an impact on the overall portfolio, where by and large given the essential retail that we've targeted, those clients are doing well. Sorry?\nRon Kamdem: Sorry about that. Go ahead.\nSumit Roy: No, that was it, Ron.\nRon Kamdem: Okay. Great. So just, I guess moving on to my second question. Just want to go back to one of the comments you made about sitting here and potentially getting 4% to 5% AFFO growth per share. Just to be clear, does that include the $1.8 billion of debt coming due next year? I think at a four or in change rate being refinanced? Or how are you thinking about the interest cost headwind in that number?\nSumit Roy: Yes, it does. And I think it does. So that's definitely going to be a headwind and the way we are thinking about it is forecasting out what the forward curve looks like today, what we think we'll be able to refinance that $1.8 billion of debt and what's the negative impact running through the income statement and therefore to the AFFO per share. All of that's been taken into account. And the big caveat here is making sure that the Spirit transaction does close in January, February and that our portfolio as we've shown to you in the third quarter continues to perform the way we expected to. And just those two pieces, I do think will allow us to get to that 4% to 5% without having to really raise $1 of equity I keep going back to that because that is a very important component of 2024.\nRon Kamdem: Great. Thanks, so much.\nSumit Roy: Absolutely.\nOperator: The next question comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nLinda Tsai : Hi. What are your plans around assuming Spirit's term loan? And how is lender reception been?\nJonathan Pong : Hey, Linda, we fully expect to assume Spirit's term loan they've got $1.1 billion outstanding with a delayed draw to get to $1.3 billion. And so it's obviously all swapped at a very attractive fixed rates for us. We have had some preliminary discussions with the lender group. The good news is that there's quite a bit of overlap with our lenders and their lenders and we've been very flattered by the reception so far from our banking orders. And so everything is going according to plan there. We'll be able to utilize those swaps that carry quite a bit of value and it fits nicely again into our maturity schedule. So everything is going fine there.\nLinda Tsai : And then in terms of the Spirit acquisition, what's the impact on Realty's credit ratings and how do fixed income investors or review [ph] view this transaction?\nJonathan Pong : Yes. So Linda was a very favorable reaction and constructive feedback from the rating agencies both Moody's and S&P they came out and reaffirmed the A3 ratings stable outlooks. And so again, we talk about how this is a very complementary portfolio and balance sheet. I would say, if you look at the before and after for some of the key credit metrics and our bond covenants, it's essentially unmoved. And so from that standpoint it was at a very lease credit neutral and some could argue you would get positive given the additional scale that provides us. And so all good on the fixed income and rating agency side.\nLinda Tsai : Just one last one. How do you think about portfolio discounts broadly like the EG group deal? Do you think they'll persist in 2024 and beyond?\nSumit Roy : I do Linda. And in fact the larger the transaction, the better discount you're going to get. We genuinely at least here at Realty Income. We believe that to be one of the core differentiators of realty income and anybody else in this space the ability to do these $1 billion transaction, $2 billion transactions and not have to worry about diversification. Obviously, you know of Jonathan and his team's ability to access capital. I mean, that's a big advantage for us. And even pre-Spirit we are probably the name that trades the most on an average daily basis and that too helps on the equity side of the equation. So I think setting aside the capital and people are more and more talking about our ability to access differentiated capital, they are approaching us with solutions that they're looking for that has multiple millions of dollars associated with it and even potentially billions of dollars associated with it. And so that's how we want to be viewed. And as soon as you start to have those discussions on a one-on-one basis, you have the ability to move cap rates a little bit more. You have the ability to construct leases that are a lot more favorable. And we've seen that -- we saw that on the transactions we just announced in the third quarter with ASDA and Morrison. We saw that on EG Group in the second quarter. We saw that on the gaming asset that we did in the fourth quarter of last year. These are all these $1 billion plus or close to $1 billion transactions. And that's where I think we will continue to shine.\nLinda Tsai : Thanks for the color.\nSumit Roy : Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Sumit Roy for any closing remarks.\nSumit Roy : Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to seeing many of you at the NAREIT conference in Los Angeles next week. Have a great afternoon. Bye-bye.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Sumit Roy",
            "content": "Thank you, Tyler, and welcome, everyone. We are proud of the solid execution we've delivered on our strategy in the third quarter and maintain a favorable outlook for our business. Our One Team at Realty Income continues to work diligently toward delivering strong results to our clients and stakeholders. The resilience, tenacity and range of our One Team has been impressive, culminating in the signing of the merger agreement with Spirit Realty, which we announced last week. This followed a quarter in which we invested $2 billion in high-quality acquisitions, raised over $2 billion in long-term and permanent capital, re-leased 284 properties at a 106.9% recapture rate, supporting an increase to our 2023 AFFO per share guidance range, which now stands at $3.98 to $4.01. I would like to thank our One Team for their leadership efforts and dedication on behalf of all of whom we serve. Our third quarter results demonstrate the consistency of our earnings profile through varying economic environments and the attractive internal growth of our high-quality real estate portfolio, while highlighting the capabilities of our One Team and platform. Notwithstanding the challenging capital markets backdrop, AFFO per share grew 4.1% from last year to $1.02 per share. Combined with our dividend, we are pleased to have delivered an annualized total operational return up approximately 9%. As announced last week, we entered into a definitive merger agreement with Spirit Realty in an all-stock transaction valued at $9.3 billion. The deal is expected to be immediately accretive to AFFO per share on a leverage-neutral basis without requiring any external capital to fund the merger. The accretion from the transaction once completed creates the foundation for AFFO per share growth in the coming year and puts us in a unique situation where we've had good visibility to an attractive forward earnings growth rate potential two months prior to the start of the new year. Given that that of course remains a fair amount of uncertainty in the capital markets environment, the accretion from the Spirit transaction is made more compelling given the lack of capital markets risk we are absorbing to effectuate this outcome. In fact, we believe our conservative underwriting of the portfolio provides for meaningful upside potential to our headline accretion expectations. We believe Spirit's portfolio is complementary to ours and we help to further diversify our industry, client and property concentrations. We expect our increased size diversification, trading liquidity and overall presence in the market will enable us to access the capital markets even more efficiently, while also improving our ability to digest larger deals without creating concentration issues within our portfolio. We are excited about the attractive cost basis, earnings accretion and enhanced ability to buy in bulk that will be effectuated through this transaction. I would like to express great appreciation for the Spirit and Realty Income teams, given their hard work and collaboration, which enabled us to successfully progress the transaction. In the third quarter, we invested approximately $2 billion in high-quality real estate investments, leased to a diversified group of clients at a 6.9% initial cash yield. $1.4 billion of this total was derived from the international business at a 6.9% yield. Investments in the quarter were made across 132 discrete transactions. I would highlight that our volume include 34 sale-leaseback transactions for $1.3 billion of volume and six deals that were greater than $50 million in size. This demonstrates that both the corporate sale leaseback and larger transaction initiatives remained advantageous for us during the quarter. A testament to our ability to source, negotiate and close on transactions that are less trafficked amongst other net lease companies both public and private. Our investment activity year-to-date is $6.8 billion, with investments in international markets representing approximately one-third of this total. Investment spreads realized during the quarter were over 100 basis points when calculating our WACC on a leverage-neutral basis and using the cost of equity and debt actually executed during the quarter. This is a decline of 30 basis points from last quarter, which is a result of the significant increase in the cost of capital \u2013 felt across the capital markets in a short amount of time. To put it into context, the average 10-year yield increased by approximately 55 basis points from Q2 to Q3. Following the sharp changes in the public debt and equity markets during the quarter, the private market cap rates have not adequately adjusted. Accordingly, we believe that it is particularly important to be disciplined and patient allocators of capital and ensuring that we are appropriately compensated for the capital we provide. We are confident in our ability to source and allocate capital and scale and with efficiency and we are deeply focused on delivering attractive risk-adjusted returns to our shareholders. Given the level of transactions completed in the first three quarters of the year, combined with an outlook for narrowed investment spreads, we are modestly increasing our investment guidance to approximately $9 billion for 2023, which excludes the Spirit transaction that is anticipated to close in 2024. This increased target reflects deals that we already had in the closing pipeline prior to the recent surge in our cost of capital. With the sharp recent changes in cost of capital, we remain highly selective in pursuing new investment opportunities and will assertively hold the line on entering into any new transactions unless we can be assured of generating ample spreads to our cost of capital. From an operating perspective, our portfolio continues to be healthy and performed well. At the end of the quarter occupancy was 98.8%. This is down slightly from last quarter's historically high occupancy level of 99% and it is a result of expected client move-outs. Rent recapture rates across 284 new and renewed leases was 106.9%. This outcome is better than our historical average of 102.3% and results in year-to-date rent recapture of 104.3% on 661 new and renewed leases. I would highlight that since 1996 we have managed over 5,300 lease expirations. And the improving recapture rates in recent years is a testament to our asset management expertise and the unparalleled historical data we have at our disposal. This competitive advantage enhances the quality of our asset management decisions through unique insights gleaned from our proprietary data analytics platform. Our credit watchlist represents 2.5% of our annualized base rent as of the end of the quarter. This is a decline of 120 basis points from the second quarter and is primarily the result of removing Cineworld from the watch list following our amendment, which became effective on October 1. We recovered 60% of prior base rent on our 41 locations without any capital contributions. Importantly we also negotiated the ability to recover rent through percentage rent agreements which could give us the ability to recapture a total of 70% of prior rent based on our internal estimates of performance. Finally with the reinvestment of certain asset sales we expect to recapture a total of approximately 85% of prior rent. Same-store rent grew at an elevated rate of 2.2%. We continue to generate increasing higher average rent escalators within the portfolio due to our commitment to investing in leases with stronger rent escalators, particularly, in international markets where we have a relatively outsized number of leases with uncapped inflation escalators. The better-than-expected same-store rent growth in the quarter has enabled us to raise our full year guidance to approximately 1.5%. With that I would like to turn the call over to Jonathan. Thank you, Jonathan. In conclusion as further demonstrated in the quarter, Realty Income has a well-established growth-focused business model that provides stable and predictable cash flows to fund the payout of our monthly dividend. We believe the platform we have created, evolved and refined is not easily replicable. We have a long history of prudently allocating capital that is complemented by our industry-leading capital leasing abilities that we used to invest across properties that fall within our well-defined investment criteria. The results of our efforts have produced our net lease portfolio that consists of more than 13,200 properties diversified across property types industries, geographies and clients. We're excited for the future of our business. Our anticipated acquisition of Spirit provides a solid building block for growth, as we head into 2024 and our existing portfolio continues to perform well. As such we find ourselves in a favorable position to produce high single or low double-digit operational returns, while offering the same stability that has defined this platform for decades. At this time we can open it up for questions. Operator? Yeah. Great question, Josh. A lot of this was driven by our non-retail re-leasings. And you can see the breakout I think we provide that in the supplemental, it was closer to 140% in terms of re-leasing spreads. It was also largely driven by this one very large industrial distribution center that we released to a new client. If you looked at just the retail side of the equation that was closer to 104% which is still slightly better than average. And I think a lot of this is really what I said in my opening remarks, the more assets we control the kind of conversations that we can enter into with our clients is a different one. One of the largest renewals was Circle K and where we looked at 100 of their assets and we're able to enter into long-term lease discussions at very favorable rates. And that is what makes this platform so unique. The fact that we do control so many assets for some of these clients, the discussion we can have where, if there is an asset that's not performing well we are more than willing to give them a rent haircut, but make that more than up across the portfolio and come up with a win-win situation for both parties. And again, it's all about size and scale, but I'd be remiss, if I don't compliment the asset management team, the predictive analytics team that continues to refine the models and give scores on each asset, which gives the asset management team the confidence to then go in and negotiate knowing that these are assets that are performing well and therefore warrant an increase. So I think it's a combination of all of those factors Joshua that we were able to realize 106.9% re-leasing spreads. Yeah. Obviously, what this is implying Josh is that, if there are assets that we believe based on some of the things that I just shared with you that we can do better than the current in-place rent. We are going to take a bit of a different stance and try to take control of those assets, especially if the existing client is looking for a rent haircut et cetera. Which obviously we may have a bit of a negative drag on occupancy levels, because we want to take control and despite our best efforts sometimes when you take control, there's a bit of a lag time between getting this new client into this building at that elevated rents. But for us, the bottom line is going to be about creating better economics on rent recapture and at a small expense on the occupancy side, if that's what's going to be needed to do that. So going forward, you will see us continue to push this strategy and continue to show to the market that we do have a differentiated asset management platform. Thank you, Josh. Yes, I'm not going to speak to Spirit because it's not a transaction that we've closed on yet. So, I'll speak very much to the pipeline that we have made. And as you can tell we obviously have a very healthy pipeline. We just increased the acquisitions to approximately $9 billion, which is an increase from where we were at the end of the third quarter. And again these are very similar to what we showed you in the third quarter. If you look at some of the largest transactions we did they were with grocery operators in the UK, it was ASDA and Morrisons, both names that we like and we're able to get these very large transactions as I believe was close to a $900 million transaction. Morrisons slightly smaller closer to $170 million sale-leaseback. Both of these were sale-leasebacks and done purely on a negotiated basis. That type of transaction is what you're going to see when we get those over the finish line in the fourth quarter. Those are the types of transactions that we have in our pipeline today. Some of the comments I've made around cap rates moving but not moving commensurate with our cost of capital movement remains true. The other piece that I will overlay is the fact that some of these transactions that we have in our pipeline were created six to nine months ago. And so people may have questions, how come you were only able to get a 6.9% cash cap rate which by the way if you look at it on a straight-line basis it's almost 8.1% and just given the inherent growth in these leases and to make it equivalent to some of the other data that is shown by some of our peers. Has the growth profile that we are targeting but potentially is not reflective? Which was obviously shown in the spreads that we were able to recapture 105 basis points, which is about 30 basis points inside of what we did in the second quarter. And that goes to the point I'm making is that cap rates though adjusting are adjusting much, much more slowly than our cost of capital. And so this is a time where going forward we are going to be hyper selective. But the makeup of the fourth quarter will be very similar. You should see a movement in cap rates in the right direction, i.e. higher cap rates and more reflective of when these transactions were essentially came on to the pipeline which started to reflect the more rapid movement in our cost of capital. So, that's what you should see. It's obviously fairly healthy. But thankfully we've raised a fair amount of capital through the ATM et cetera already. Off the top of my head, outside of the Bellagio transaction, I don't believe we have a JV structure in the pipeline. Similar to the way we structured the Bellagio transaction, we do tend to have JVs with developers where they hold on to a small stake in the development while developing the assets, et cetera, but we generally tend to be the takeout on the back end. But I don't think Nate and correct me if I'm wrong, that you meant those types of JVs. You were talking about more permanent JV structures like the one that we've entered into with Bellagio. I don't believe we have one like that. There is one -- there are products out there by the way, that do lend themselves to this JV structure. There are asset classes that require a tremendous amount of capital, where we will be more than forthcoming about entering into a JV just given the sheer amount of capital required. But those are going to be very specific to a very specific asset type, and I would put casinos in that bucket and perhaps some other asset types that lends itself to this. But as of right now, we don't have other JVs that we've entered into. Yes. Data centers is certainly an asset type that will require based on this influx of AI, et cetera. It's an asset type that will have a massive requirement in terms of capital. I could see, if we choose to go into that area, that's an area that JV-ing with an operator would make perfect sense. Sure. So you tell me, if buying Asda and Morrisons is diluting the quality of the asset pool at realty income handle. I think we've tried to answer this question before that, we do not target investment grade. What we are looking for are assets that we believe, are priced and have a profile of generating a return that is on a risk-adjusted basis, the right return profile. That is how we think about the world. And the fact that, we are able to enter into these negotiated transactions, with some of the best operators in UK. I think is something we are very comfortable doing. And the fact that they don't have a an investment-grade rating is not an issue for us given how we were able to price it, the fact that these are top quartile assets that we were able to get and have inherent growth profiles that will continue to pay dividend in years to come. So for us, it's looking at the entire investment in totality. To determine how much risk are we really taking on? What is the operator? Where are they in terms of positioning? How are they positioned within that particular sector? What is the actual real estate that we are getting? What is the performance of the four wall? I think those are the things that we focus on. And the fact that they turn out to be investment grade or not, is almost a byproduct of that analysis rather than something that we target. And I think I've said this before but thank you for asking the question. I'll keep repeating this. I believe we had about 20% of our investments this quarter that was investment grade. But again that could be in some quarters 40%, in some quarters it could even be less than that. And we will, of course, continue to share that information with you but a portfolio that on a straight-line basis generates north of 8% yield, I think is something that we are very proud of Haendel. That's a great question, Michael. Look, I think if you look at where we are today and you look a year ahead in 2024, we believe that without having to rely on the equity capital markets, we'll be able to deliver approximately 4% to 5% AFFO per share growth. And that is a pretty powerful statement to make and that obviously assumes that the Spirit transaction closes either in the first month, either in January or in February. And with just the free cash flow that we are going to generate pro forma, which is going to be right around $800 million, some of the headwinds that we are going to experience in the refinancing, absorbing all of that to be able to sit here today and say that we could deliver that growth without having to raise $1 of equity. I think it's a very good place to be. And so when I said about being hyper selective, what has happened more recently is that the cost of capital has moved so dramatically, so quickly that the cap rates haven't had a chance to sort of adjust. And so we find ourselves in this \u2013 like I said in the second quarter, we had about 135 basis points of spread. And then in this quarter we have 105 basis points of spread. It's a tough environment to be in when we are entering into transactions six months, seven months in advance of closing a transaction and the cap rate environment \u2013 I mean the cost of capital environment changes and when you are permanently financing it, it sort of eats into what you had originally underwritten. That is what I meant when I said, we want to be hyper selective because we want to help drive the cap rates out to help accommodate for these unforeseen movements in the cost of capital. And so clearly the cap rates haven't adjusted as much and that's what I said that's what I mean when I say we want to be hyper selective. We want to wait for the cap rates to adjust to make sure that we can get the spreads that we have historically achieved. That was really the color behind that comment. Sure. That's a great follow-on question, Michael. So for us we are looking at a particular real estate through the lens of maximizing revenue. And the revenue maximization strategy by its very definition will mean that we are more than comfortable holding on to certain assets that are vacant for longer. If we have concluded that there is a use for that particular location and that it's not the very first client that comes in and gives us a rent proposal. But the kind of client that we are targeting and the client and a profile of rent that we are targeting that takes time. And so we are more than comfortable taking a little bit of a hit on the occupancy side to make sure that we get the best revenue optimization for that given location. And that's what you're going to see. That's the reason why even though we've been running the portfolio at 99% for the last three quarters, we have always maintained that our occupancy is going to be up slightly above 98%. Because that we believe is a natural state of occupancy for the business model that we are trying to run here. And look, where it makes sense, we will continue to sell assets vacant, if we believe that that is the most economically desirable outcome that holding on to those assets does have a cost and that just continues to drag into the return profile. So selling assets vacant is also a strategy that we will continue to implement. So I just don't want you to start thinking now in terms of, hey, there will be no more vacant asset sales. All of those options are available to us and we will pursue the one that generates the best revenue outcome. We've been talking about these two transactions for a while now, Brad. So, some of it's just taken a little bit longer to get this over the finish line. And some of it has been that cap rates do take a little bit longer to adjust in the international markets than they do here just because of the depth of the market here. You should continue to see a fair amount of product coming in from the international markets and that's reflected in our pipeline. But I always go back to when somebody asks at the beginning of the year where do you think you're going to end up? We always say that it's right around that 30% to 40% will be the international investments. And 60% to 70% will be the US And I think that is probably where we'll end up at the end of the year as well. Yeah. Everything that we've shared with you on Cineworld is obviously in the form of an agreement. So any impact that, it's going to have is reflected in the comments that we've made about next year and the fourth quarter of this year. Eric, I don't know if you're looking for anything more that we are not expecting to give you a surprise that because of the Cineworld transaction there's going to be a drag on anything that we've shared with you. That's already been absorbed and shared. It's reflected in the updated guidance that we have for 2023 and in the comments that I've made about what we expect to see happen in 2024. Yes, this is an ongoing debate. The clients tend to think about the world 12 months ago and we are trying to get them to understand the world has changed dramatically. It is that stickiness that causes the cap rate movements to drag and that's no different today. What we are seeing, however is that, when there is pressure on the client i.e. there's a maturity that they have to deal with on the debt side or they have a pipeline that is helping drive their growth and they have to build out assets or operate assets. That's where we see a willingness to transact and accommodate the new cost of capital environment. But it depends on the client it depends on the sophistication of the client it depends on the need and the urgency that the client is experiencing at that point in time where these conversations are either fairly straightforward and easy or there's a bit of a delta between what they're expecting and hoping versus what we can deliver. Sure. Ron, so the Cineworld will not have an impact on the four-wall coverage, because we don't get store-specific on a quarter-by-quarter basis. That number that we share with you our own assets where we do have a fair amount of visibility with regards to four-wall coverage. So when we have assets that have a point in time disclosure, we generally don't try to include that, so no, it won't have an impact. With regards to what we are seeing that 2.8 to 2.9 has been a fairly consistent number over the last call it three quarters. And it was a bit surprising all of last year because the cost of capital has started moving and we were expecting there to be a little bit more noise and what we ended up learning through the processes even the reserves that we had created we had to sort of unwind to reflect that the clients were doing better than what we had expected. And that theme has sort of played out. There are certainly some bankruptcies in the casual dining side, on the franchisee side that they are such a small portion of our overall portfolio. I am talking single digit basis points that they don't have much of an impact on the overall portfolio, where by and large given the essential retail that we've targeted, those clients are doing well. Sorry? No, that was it, Ron. Yes, it does. And I think it does. So that's definitely going to be a headwind and the way we are thinking about it is forecasting out what the forward curve looks like today, what we think we'll be able to refinance that $1.8 billion of debt and what's the negative impact running through the income statement and therefore to the AFFO per share. All of that's been taken into account. And the big caveat here is making sure that the Spirit transaction does close in January, February and that our portfolio as we've shown to you in the third quarter continues to perform the way we expected to. And just those two pieces, I do think will allow us to get to that 4% to 5% without having to really raise $1 of equity I keep going back to that because that is a very important component of 2024. Absolutely. I do Linda. And in fact the larger the transaction, the better discount you're going to get. We genuinely at least here at Realty Income. We believe that to be one of the core differentiators of realty income and anybody else in this space the ability to do these $1 billion transaction, $2 billion transactions and not have to worry about diversification. Obviously, you know of Jonathan and his team's ability to access capital. I mean, that's a big advantage for us. And even pre-Spirit we are probably the name that trades the most on an average daily basis and that too helps on the equity side of the equation. So I think setting aside the capital and people are more and more talking about our ability to access differentiated capital, they are approaching us with solutions that they're looking for that has multiple millions of dollars associated with it and even potentially billions of dollars associated with it. And so that's how we want to be viewed. And as soon as you start to have those discussions on a one-on-one basis, you have the ability to move cap rates a little bit more. You have the ability to construct leases that are a lot more favorable. And we've seen that -- we saw that on the transactions we just announced in the third quarter with ASDA and Morrison. We saw that on EG Group in the second quarter. We saw that on the gaming asset that we did in the fourth quarter of last year. These are all these $1 billion plus or close to $1 billion transactions. And that's where I think we will continue to shine. Thank you. Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to seeing many of you at the NAREIT conference in Los Angeles next week. Have a great afternoon. Bye-bye."

            "name": "Jonathan Pong",
            "content": "Thank you, Sumit. Discipline and a commitment to our A3/A minus- credit ratings continue to be our priorities from a balance sheet management perspective. During the third quarter our net debt to annualized pro forma adjusted EBITDA and fixed charge coverage ratios each fell by 10% to 5.2 times and 4.5 times, respectively. In the third quarter we issued $886 million of equity primarily through our ATM program while ending the quarter with $749 million of unsettled forward equity outstanding. Combined with cash on hand with $344 million, the net availability on our credit facility of $3.4 billion we ended the quarter with $4.5 billion of liquidity. As we look forward to future capital raising needs we continue to have rate protection on $1 billion of notional value to hedge against a rising 10-year yield. We purchased this protection in the form of a derivative instrument called a swaption corridor, which effectively limits our rate exposure on a future note issuance at an option premium below the cost of a regular way vanilla option. We purchased this option in late March when a 10-year yield was in the 3.5% area. And as of quarter end the net value of the swaptions had a mark-to-market value of approximately $25 million. As Sumit mentioned previously, the Spirit transaction provides us with the opportunity for meaningful earnings accretion in the coming years. From a balance sheet perspective, the Spirit team has done a great job in curating a well-laddered debt maturity schedule, which limits our future refinancing risk in any given year. As we have experienced throughout the company's history, the global rate environment provides both headwinds and tailwinds in any given year, which is why the assumption of balance fixed rate debt stack that is spread fairly ratably from 2025 through 2032 and provides us with extended financial benefits with manageable refinancing risk. When giving effect to the combined debt maturity stack, we estimate that there will not be a year when more than 12% of our total fixed rate debt comes due. Similar to the complementary real estate portfolio, Spirits debt stack is also a good fit with our existing maturity schedule, and we expect the continued debt stack or the combined debt stack to remain well laddered giving us numerous opportunities to engage in opportunistic liability management exercises when -- and economically advantageous to do so. When I finally I would like to thank all of our team members who have worked so incredibly hard in helping to support this transaction, and we will continue to be integral as we move towards close and integration. With that, I would like to turn it back to Sumit. No, nothing that you should expect for the fourth quarter, pretty much all of the reserve reversals that were significant have been taken as of the third quarter. You may have seen in our same-store rent growth slide in the supplement that we saw a bit of a bump in health and fitness and that was really related to one more regional client that we reserved or refers to reserve off of. As we look forward into 2024, nothing lumpy from that standpoint that would be on the radar as we think about just bad debt expense in general, modeling out the following year we always have some semblance of an unidentified reserve that we put in there just given our history. And we're obviously very conservative on that front. And I think we've said this before, but we've historically realized about a 25 basis point credit loss in the portfolio at any given year. Hey Brad, it's Jonathan. So, all options are available to us. Obviously, each one of them on a nominal or absolute basis isn't where we would want it to be. But I think the one thing to consider is we're always going to prioritize that 5.5 times leverage first and foremost. And so when you look at our equity costs, you compare it to our indicative cost of 10-year unsecured debt across all three currencies that we can operate in. There is a difference that isn't necessarily wider than usual but there is a bit of a gap but we aren't going to sacrifice the balance sheet we are going to lever up just to eke out a couple of extra 10th of a basis point of growth for next year. So you could expect us to be very predictable from that standpoint and by predictable, it's carrying a reasonable balance on the line in our CP program having 10% or so of variable rate debt outstanding at any point in time and being very prudent with laddering out our maturities on a go-forward basis. Hi, Eric. That's really driven by the accounting guidance where when you have sale-leaseback transactions and you look at the rent relative to market, the classification of that revenue goes into a different bucket it goes into other revenues and also the corresponding balance sheet impact also will show up there. So it's no different than any other regular way transaction we do it's just given the nature of it being a sale-leaseback deal with the purchase price accounting that's dictating some of the valuation associated, with the real estate versus the cash flow and that's why you see that as that bump. Yes. Hey, Linda, we fully expect to assume Spirit's term loan they've got $1.1 billion outstanding with a delayed draw to get to $1.3 billion. And so it's obviously all swapped at a very attractive fixed rates for us. We have had some preliminary discussions with the lender group. The good news is that there's quite a bit of overlap with our lenders and their lenders and we've been very flattered by the reception so far from our banking orders. And so everything is going according to plan there. We'll be able to utilize those swaps that carry quite a bit of value and it fits nicely again into our maturity schedule. So everything is going fine there. Yes. So Linda was a very favorable reaction and constructive feedback from the rating agencies both Moody's and S&P they came out and reaffirmed the A3 ratings stable outlooks. And so again, we talk about how this is a very complementary portfolio and balance sheet. I would say, if you look at the before and after for some of the key credit metrics and our bond covenants, it's essentially unmoved. And so from that standpoint it was at a very lease credit neutral and some could argue you would get positive given the additional scale that provides us. And so all good on the fixed income and rating agency side."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Steve Bakke, Vice President of Capital Markets and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nSteve Bakke: Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income\u2019s second quarter operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; Christie Kelly, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Jonathan Pong, Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Finance. During this conference call, we will make statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. The Company\u2019s actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause differences in the Company\u2019s Form 10-Q. We\u2019ll be observing a two-question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you would like to ask additional questions, you may reenter the queue. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy.\nSumit Roy: Thank you, Steve. Welcome, everyone. We successfully executed on our strategy in the second quarter and continue to see momentum across the business. I would like to sincerely thank our One Team whose focus and commitment to continue to propel our business forward, serving all our clients and stakeholders. We believe the strength of our platform and quality of our real estate portfolio were evident in the quarter\u2019s results. Despite a challenging interest rate environment, AFFO per share grew 3.1% from last year to $1 per share. Combined with our dividend, we are pleased to have delivered a total operational return of over 8% on a trailing 12-month basis. Delivering stable and consistent growth is foundational to our mission at Realty Income. Underlying this growth, our team continues to source and invest in high-quality properties at accretive spreads to our cost of capital while partnering with our clients who are leaders in nondiscretionary, low-price point and service-oriented industries. Partnering with industry leaders across over 13,000 properties in a diversified real estate portfolio offers us durability of cash flows that results in the predictable nature of our revenues, earnings and dividend payments. Our investment activities remain robust as we continue to demonstrate that size and scale are unique advantages in the sale-leaseback and portfolio transaction markets. In the second quarter, we closed on approximately $3.1 billion of high-quality real estate investments, which brings our year-to-date investment activity to over $4.7 billion. Cap rates in our acquisitions appear to have stabilized after a meaningful adjustment period to a higher interest rate environment. Though in select situations, we continue to find unique opportunities to source and close on larger transactions where our relationships, platform and access to capital allow us to take advantage of more favorable terms. Our second quarter initial cash lease yield of 6.9% represents a 120 basis-point increase compared to the second quarter of 2022 and resulted in a realized investment spread of approximately 133 basis points when calculating our WACC on a leverage-neutral basis using the cost of equity and debt raised in the quarter. In addition to closing our $1.5 billion U.S. convenience store acquisition from the EG Group, we remained active internationally during the second quarter, closing on $416 million of investments at an initial cash lease yield of 7.1%. This international activity includes the addition of a new geographic vertical in Ireland where we acquired two properties for $54 million at healthy cash yields. Given the transaction velocity we have achieved in the first half of the year, we are increasing our outlook for investments to over $7 billion for 2023. Year-to-date, we have acquired 15% of source investment volume compared to an average of 7% over the last five years. In today\u2019s more constrained environment for capital, we have found the size and scale of our platform have become increasingly meaningful differentiators as we seek accretive growth opportunities. Shifting to operations, our portfolio continues to perform, and we ended the quarter with occupancy of 99%, the third consecutive quarter at that level. This matches our highest occupancy at the end of a reporting period in over 20 years. Additionally, our rent recapture rates increased from last quarter to 103.4% across 201 new and renewed leases, bringing the year-to-date recapture rate to 102.7% across 377 new or renewed leases executed in the period. As further testament to the stability of our portfolio and the leading clients with whom we partner, our client watch list declined from last quarter and now represent less than 4% of our annualized rental revenue. This is the lowest level in the last five years. Finally, our same-store rental revenue increased 2.0% in the quarter, a tangible result of our purposeful decision to seek investment opportunities with higher internal growth characteristics as well as the benefit of uncapped CPI-based rent escalators, present in nearly 30% of the leases in our growing international portfolio. Our efforts to increasingly pursue leases with meaningful contractual rent escalators has helped contribute to a portfolio with contractual rent growth at approximately 1.5% per annum as of the second quarter, or 2% annual growth on a levered basis. Before turning it over to Christie, I would like to recognize the tremendous value she has brought to Realty Income, first as a Board member, and then as Chief Financial Officer. Her leadership and counsel through a very active period for our company has left a lasting positive mark. As well, I would also like to congratulate Jonathan on his upcoming promotion to CFO. Christie?\nChristie Kelly: Thank you, Sumit. It\u2019s an honor to serve our colleagues, Board and stakeholders during this exciting time at Realty Income. As we previously announced at the end of this year, I will be retiring as CFO and passing our CFO baton to Jonathan Pong, who is our current Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Finance. Jonathan has been with the Company for the last nine years and brings significant experience to the role, having overseen our capital markets, investor relations, FP&A and derivatives functions during his time here. Over the last 2.5 years, since joining the management team, we have worked closely together as part of a planned succession, and Jonathan is well positioned to carry the torch moving forward. With that, I would like to hand the call over to Jonathan to go over the financial results from our quarter.\nJonathan Pong: Thank you, Christie. I would be remiss without acknowledging your many contributions to the Company and its stakeholders during your tenure. I\u2019m grateful for your guidance, support and leadership, all of which have laid the foundation for excellence as our business continues to evolve. Over my 9-year, 10-year at Realty Income, we have experienced significant growth in new industry verticals, geographies and property types. However, we\u2019ve continued to view a reliable growing dividend and a well-capitalized balance sheet as critical components of our business. To that end, we finished the second quarter with healthy leverage as measured by net debt to annualized pro forma adjusted EBITDA of 5.3 times and our fixed charge coverage ratio remains solid at 4.6 times. We are once again active issuers of equity capital via the ATM, raising approximately $2.2 billion in the aggregate in the second quarter, $651 million of unsettled forward equity remains outstanding as of today. As our platform has advanced and grown over time, our investment spread business has been supported by access to a wide range of products in the capital markets. Last month, we added another capital source to our inventory, raising \u20ac1.1 billion through our debut public offering of euro-denominated unsecured bonds. This dual tranche offering resulted in a weighted average tenure of 9 years and a weighted average annual yield to maturity of 5.08%. Establishing a presence in the euro unsecured bond market allowed us to diversify our fixed income investor base, and generate a natural hedge for yield denominated earnings and access of source of debt capital that was priced approximately 60 basis points inside of indicative U.S. dollar bond pricing at the time of execution. Proceeds from the offering effectively repaid short-term borrowings on a multicurrency revolver and commercial paper programs, which had a combined balance of $990 million at quarter end. Combined with $254 million of cash on hand at quarter end and the $650 million of forward equity previously mentioned, we believe we are well capitalized with significant liquidity heading into the third quarter. Finally, from an earnings outlook perspective, the midpoint of our 2023 AFFO per share guidance is unchanged, though we are narrowing the guidance range of $3.96 to $4.01, representing approximately 1.8% growth at the midpoint. With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Sumit.\nSumit Roy: Thank you, Jonathan. As our second quarter results illustrate, our company is well positioned to provide consistent results in a variety of economic environments and to grow through a variety of different acquisition channels. The optionality we have to toggle between different sources of capital is also a competitive advantage as it broadens our reach of investors and oftentimes provides a lower cost of capital alternative to the public U.S. dollar market. Looking at the S&P 500 constituents within our addressable market, we count approximately 300 firms with $1.6 trillion of owned real estate. To quantify the near-term opportunity, which is available to us as sale-leaseback capital providers, this group has approximately $1.2 trillion of debt representing 34% of the group\u2019s outstanding debt capital maturing between 2024 and 2027. Meanwhile, corporate bond deals have risen anywhere between 240 and 400 basis points from the 2021 average to today. This compares to a 140 basis-point increase in initial cash lease yields for Realty Income\u2019s investments over the same time frame, making our capital solutions even more competitively priced on a relative basis than in the past. Because of this cost of capital convergence and because of the many benefits sale-leaseback financing provides, including the elimination of maturity risk, we believe there is a more compelling case to be made than ever for corporates to look to sale-leaseback financing to replace maturing debt. As the attractiveness of sale-leaseback financing accelerates for corporates with looming debt maturities and elevated debt costs, we believe our growth opportunities will continue to expand on a sustainable basis. At this time, we can open it up for questions. Operator?\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Nate Crossett of BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nNate Crossett: Maybe just a question on guidance. Maybe you could just unpack, you guys increased acquisition and volume guidance but the midpoint on AFFO remained the same. Maybe you can just kind of go over the puts and takes there. And then also, what are you guys assuming for kind of cap rates in your guidance, I think were down 10 basis points in the quarter. What\u2019s kind of the outlook of the pipeline right now?\nSumit Roy: So Nate, I\u2019ll take your second question first, and then I\u2019ll hand it off to Jonathan to talk about puts and takes with regards to the earnings guidance. With regards to the cap rate, we are assuming the cap rate to be within the ZIP code that we\u2019ve announced in the second quarter and in the first quarter. That\u2019s where we believe where the cap rates have settled down. Opportunistically, there are situations that we could enter into where we could drive those cap rates higher. But for modeling purposes, I would request that you keep it within these ZIP codes that we\u2019ve announced in the first and second quarter. Jonathan?\nJonathan Pong: Hey Nate, on the guidance question, I would, first of all say, the midpoint of our guide is the same as the as it was at the start of the year. And so, when you think about how we put guidance together, there\u2019s a lot of puts and takes that we look at, at the beginning of the year, revisit at every quarter. We know that on a probability-weighted basis, not all of the takes are going to happen and all the puts are going to happen. And so when you think about acquisition guidance increasing two quarters now, that was a scenario that we had expected at the start of the year, but there was always going to be puts and takes that could offset that a bit. I think the biggest one for us has been short-term interest rates. When you look at what was implied back in January and February on the SOFR forward curve, you compare that to what it is implying today, about a 40 basis-point increase. And so that alone is $0.01 per share for our business in the back half of the year. So I would say that, and there\u2019s also some other things that we always get that maybe we\u2019re taking a slightly more conservative view on over the second half of the year appropriately, but we feel very good about being more or less accurate from what we came out at the start of the year.\nNate Crossett: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Maybe just one on the debt rates are much lower in Europe. You did that recent bond deal. Can you just like talk about how much you could kind of theoretically raise over there to kind of take advantage of the better cost of capital? Are there any like hindrances like in terms of size?\nJonathan Pong: Yes, Nate. We\u2019re not going to go crazy and have significantly more liabilities denominated in one currency relative to the assets we have denominated in that same currency, especially when it\u2019s foreign denominated. And so for us, when we\u2019re going out and issuing in various currencies, we\u2019re thinking about the income statement, FX risk that we might have, and we\u2019re using the natural interest expense in that currency to serve as a hedge. If we don\u2019t have that, there\u2019s not a lot of reason for us to go out and do that type of issuance. We also know that we have a very active acquisition pipeline across all currencies. We know that we\u2019re going to need the capital at some point really denominated in dollars, sterling or euro. So, that\u2019s how we think about it. It was a 60 basis-point pickup relative to comparable U.S. dollar, but for us, it\u2019s really about diversification. And so, you can expect us to utilize everything in our toolkit going forward. But I think we are all set on the euro side, at least for the near term.\nOperator: The next question comes from Greg McGinniss of Scotiabank.\nGreg McGinniss: So, as always, I\u2019m interested in any larger portfolio deals. And we appreciate your opening remarks regarding the size of the potentially addressable S&P 500 market. But have you noticed any material uptick in sale-leaseback interest from those companies at this point, or is that still a developing potential?\nSumit Roy: I guess, we have to post one of these large transactions per quarter. And I think we\u2019ve done that. If you look at what we\u2019ve done in the fourth quarter of last year, that\u2019s when we closed on the gaming asset, which was $1.7 billion. You look at the large portfolio deal we did in the first quarter, it was a CIM transaction. That was circa $900 million. And in the second quarter, we\u2019ve announced the $1.5 billion and closed the $1.5 billion EG Group transaction. And look, the reason why we are sharing all of this data is to help support what we are seeing develop in our pipeline and the conversations that we are having currently. Now, how much of that gets translated to close transactions, time will tell. But clearly, we are very optimistic. And that is one of the main drivers of why we have increased our guidance by another $1 billion in terms of acquisitions. So, we just feel like -- I wish our cost of capital was slightly better. But in terms of actual transactions, we feel like the pipeline is robust and it\u2019s largely a function of what is happening in the debt capital market.\nGreg McGinniss: Okay. What are your thoughts on increasing maybe the level of tenant debt investments to push earnings growth higher and offset some of that cost of capital? It\u2019s not exactly where you want it.\nSumit Roy: Well, we think of ourselves as an investment company. And Greg, so where we invest on the capital stack is always available for debate within the four walls of Realty Income. And wherever we feel like we can quantify the risk and underwrite the benefits of doing a sale-leaseback versus doing a direct loan to one of our clients, we are going to go down the path of whichever yields the best risk-adjusted return. So, yes, we haven\u2019t done one of those, but it is certainly up for discussion, and it\u2019s one that we have been discussing with my colleagues here at Realty Income.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brad Heffern of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nBrad Heffern: Sumit, can you give your updated thoughts on how you feel about the theater business broadly right now? Obviously, AMC recently reported its best week, but then you have the strikes, which will theoretically start affecting things at some point and the release schedule isn\u2019t back to normal. So, are you feeling worse at this point or better given the recent strength?\nSumit Roy: Yes. So Brad, I\u2019ve always stated this about the theater business that it is largely a function of content. And as long as the content continues to develop and it goes back to levels that it was pre-pandemic, which was circa 70, 75 big tent type releases, we\u2019re going to get back to levels pretty close to the revenue levels that we had in 2019. And anytime you have situations like the one that you\u2019ve just described where you have a strike, it does obviously put a little bit of a breaker in terms of the ability of studios to continue to release those big tent movies. The good news in today\u2019s environment versus the last time there was a strike, which lasted, if I remember correctly from -- for about four months. The good news today is we\u2019ve got a lot more studios beyond the big four that are releasing big budget movies, and I\u2019d put Amazon and Netflix in the mix there. But yes, all else being equal, a strike is not a good thing. Do I see this having a near-term impact, I don\u2019t think so because a lot of these movies have already been completed, and it\u2019s just a question of staging the release. But longer term, it could have a disruption on how many of these movies get released. And so, we are watching this closely. I believe there\u2019s a meeting on Friday, where the studios are getting together with the writers and the actors and all of that. And my hope is that there\u2019s a resolution soon. And -- but yes, it is a situation that we are monitoring closely. But my expectation, if it is anything like what it was last time, this should resolve itself in the next couple of months.\nBrad Heffern: Okay. I appreciate that. And then can you give your expectations for the Cineworld sites that were rejected and maybe talk through some of the opportunities with those, whether it\u2019s just typical releasing or if there\u2019s a development opportunity for any of them?\nSumit Roy: Yes. So Brad, I\u2019m not going to give -- go into the details of the Cineworld situation, just because we haven\u2019t quite penned the contract yet. What I will say is that any of the potential economic outcomes have been completely reflected in our updated earnings guidance. So, that\u2019s how I\u2019m going to leave it with the Cineworld situation. And I\u2019ll just add something to stuff that I\u2019ve already talked about in the past, there will be a few assets that we expect to get back. And we have already started to look at what are the alternatives at those particular sites. And the gamut runs from a complete redevelopment of the site to an alternative use, i.e., industrial to situations where we have a retailer coming in and talking about potentially just taking the asset as is, even though they\u2019re not movie theater operators, to potentially re-entitling the asset for an alternative use and selling it, i.e., creating more value for ourselves. And the last bucket will be just selling the asset as is. So, all of those various permutations are being considered on a handful of assets that we expect will get rejected through this process. But, I\u2019m not going to go into any more detail than that.\nOperator: The next question comes from Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nHaendel St. Juste: Sumit, I\u2019d like to go back to a conversation we\u2019ve had in the past on i-grade. You continue to source deals here with a lower share of i-grade than historically. And I know in the past, you\u2019ve talked about that your experience in acquiring higher-yielding assets and you\u2019re focused on generating the best risk-adjusted returns. But this quarter, particularly, we had a big drop, but it continues the trend of having below average i-grade. So I guess, is this a dynamic that we should just expect to continue going forward? Is this a new norm? How should we think about the share of i-grade going forward? Thank you.\nSumit Roy: Sure. Thank you for that question, Haendel. So just to continue to reiterate the point, we are not targeting investment-grade. What we are targeting are opportunities that yield the best risk-adjusted return. If it so happens that it is an investment-grade client and so be it. But ultimately, it\u2019s the economic profile of that investment that\u2019s going to dictate as to whether or not we are going to invest. Today, truth be told, we are looking at some of these investment-grade opportunities and cannot pencil the risk-adjusted returns. We are finding far more value in areas where we\u2019re looking at subinvestment-grade tenants who are willing to give us a return profile that is commensurate with the inherent risk in that particular opportunity. And that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the approximately 26% year-to-date investment-grade closings that we\u2019ve done and is close to 18%, I think, for the second quarter. But that\u2019s how we think about the world. And the other thing I\u2019d just point out is just to make it equivalent because I have seen some of these cap rates being reported and there\u2019s a bit of a mixed match. When we\u2019re talking about a 6.9% cash lease yield, if you layer in the straight line, we\u2019re talking about an additional 100 basis points. And I\u2019ve seen certain reports that are sort of conflating these two numbers. So just to make it apples-to-apples, our straight line yields are closer to 7.9% on $3.1 billion worth of acquisitions. That\u2019s where we are seeing the value, with, I would argue, much better growth profile. And clearly, that\u2019s represented in the 100 basis points of increase when compared to cash yields. So that\u2019s how you should think about us Haendel. And if it just so happens that this dynamic were to shift and suddenly investment-grade was to go back to our 40%, 45% that we have in our portfolio, then that will be it. But it\u2019s not something that we target, and you shouldn\u2019t expect us to be targeting that number going forward.\nHaendel St. Juste: That\u2019s really helpful. I appreciate the color there. And one more. I guess, I wanted to get your updated thoughts on investing in gaming assets today. I know in the past, you\u2019ve talked about having an interest. I\u2019m curious if you\u2019re seeing anything out there today that would interest you, what type of returns or incremental spreads you require there? And specifically, your potential -- or your level of interest in a potential Bellagio trade. Thank you.\nSumit Roy: Sure. So again, I\u2019m not going to talk about specifics, but I\u2019ll repeat what I\u2019ve said in the past about our desire to grow our gaming vertical. We are obviously looking at many opportunities. And thankfully, it\u2019s a fairly robust environment today for gaming. And yes, in terms of how we\u2019re going to view these opportunities, it\u2019s along the lines of how I answered the previous question. So that\u2019s what you should expect from us for this particular vertical.\nOperator: The next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJoshua Dennerlein: I just -- I saw your cap rates on -- it looks like domestic acquisitions is about 6.8% and then, for developments, it was like a 6.9%. Some basis point spread seems kind of small. So just -- is that a function of kind of when deals were struck or just the risk profile of the tenants or just something that you\u2019re seeing broadly in the market?\nSumit Roy: Yes. Very good question, Joshua. As you know, when you enter into transactions that have a long duration associated with it, which is what development by its very definition, is going to have. It does become a function of when were those transactions entered into and what\u2019s the duration of that build-out period. And so, what you might have noticed is if you\u2019re tracking our development yields over the last few quarters, you\u2019ve noticed a marked increase in those cash yields on developments. It\u2019s largely a function of when did we strike those. So things that you\u2019re starting to see filter through in the second quarter, which has a similar yield to what you saw on the domestic side, it\u2019s largely a function of us having entered into those transactions over the last two to three quarters, when we were anticipating a much higher interest rate environment and therefore, being able to work with our clients to get that yield reflected in the development cycle. And you should continue to see that. Trends slightly higher looking into the next few quarters as some of the older generation development opportunities start to sort of get fully developed and are -- become cash paying opportunities. So I think just keep a close eye on that and that\u2019s the trend you should see manifest itself over the next few quarters.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. All right. That makes sense. And then I think Jonathan might have answered this, but I just wanted to clarify, the top end of guidance, it looks like you took down $0.02. Was it just the interest rate environment that\u2019s pushing down -- put downward pressure on that top range or anything else in there? Just curious, given acquisition guidance a bit, so.\nJonathan Pong: Hey Josh. To address that, Sumit brought it up earlier, the impact of what we felt was the greatest uncertainty out there, the Cineworld resolution, tat impact is now that is known to us. And going into the quarter, it was something where there was a range of possibilities that we built into the high end and the low end. And so with a greater sense of confidence now where that\u2019s trending, we felt that it was appropriate to take the high end down by $0.02 in addition to bringing the low end up by $0.02.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Goldsmith of UBS. Please go ahead.\nMichael Goldsmith: Jonathan, you\u2019ve been with Realty Income for a while, and I think you\u2019re developing a reputation for a creative solution from a financing perspective. But as you move into the CFO seat, is there anything different that -- is there anything different that you would think about doing in their new position or different approaches to what Realty is doing overall? Thanks.\nJonathan Pong: Thanks, Michael. I appreciate the question. I would say, look, what\u2019s made Realty Income so successful over the years, regardless of what we\u2019ve done, what verticals we\u2019ve established, it\u2019s commitment to a fortress balance sheet. And that\u2019s the one thing that is going to be sacrosanct to us for as long as we\u2019re in existence in these seats. And so, we\u2019re not going to sacrifice things like the A3 minus credit rating that we worked very hard to get. We\u2019re not going to sacrifice the trust of the fixed income community that now spans across three different currencies. And so, you\u2019re going to see us continue to focus on low leverage, plenty of liquidity and we\u2019re going to be very predictable from that standpoint. I think going forward, given the added complexity of the business, the volume, the transaction volume that we see, the different countries that we\u2019re in, and we\u2019ll continue to be in, I think it\u2019s really more of a focus on more of the internal operations now. The external side of things, I think we\u2019re pretty well established. We\u2019re going to continue to be creative. But I think it\u2019s about building and continuing this momentum on the internal platform that we\u2019ve created, which we think is a differentiator in the net lease industry and frankly, in the real estate industry.\nMichael Goldsmith: And Sumit, you mentioned your size and scale as a competitive advantage, at least twice, if not 3 times on the call. Do you feel like -- do you feel like your competitive advantage is growing? Are you seeing fewer bidders on some of the larger deals out there? Is that gap and the strength of the size and scale, is that improving and widening versus peers? Thanks.\nSumit Roy: Thanks for the question, Michael. I might have actually said it four times. I\u2019m not sure. I just believe in it so much. And it\u2019s really not something that we believe. It\u2019s what we are hearing. When we are engaging in these conversations with clients who are big clients who have big questions that they\u2019re trying to answer, it\u2019s the fact that who gets invited to the table. And when we see that we are the only REIT in the net lease space at the table competing against private sources of capital, that in itself gives us continued confidence that we are playing a game that is very different from some of our smaller peers. And we want to be that. We want to be the real estate partners of choice for the S&P 500 names. We want to be the first name that is considered when we -- when folks think about -- they have the ability to write big checks. They have the ability to stand by what it is they say. Their reputation speaks for itself and their ability to close is bar none. And when we hear those comments from clients who work with us and more recently with some of our new clients who\u2019ve been added to our registry, it gives us continued confidence to say that our scale and size is being appreciated within this space.\nOperator: The next question comes from Eric Wolfe of Citi. Please go ahead.\nEric Wolfe: Just wanted to follow up on Greg\u2019s question. When you look at your S&P peers, just curious what percentage would you say are receptive to the sale-leaseback conversation? And how has that changed versus a couple of years ago? Just trying to understand how your addressable market has changed. And for those that perhaps aren\u2019t as receptive what\u2019s the typical pushback?\nSumit Roy: I can\u2019t give you percentages, Eric. But what I can point to is just look at some of the larger transactions we\u2019ve done and who have we done it with. And they\u2019re all first time sale-leaseback candidates, right? Think about Wind. [ph] They were -- they\u2019ve never done a sale-leaseback before, and they chose to do it with us. Think about EG Group they\u2019ve never done a sale-leaseback before. Their best chance of doing a sale-leaseback was when they actually ended up being the winners in the Cumberland Farms portfolio. This was three, four years ago. And they chose not to do it at that time. And so part of the reason why I believe that sale-leaseback as a product is maturing, is certainly driven by the capital markets environment that we find ourselves in and suddenly finding that sale-leaseback as an alternative to raise capital is quite beneficial vis-\u00e0-vis as we were traditionally being compared to the debt capital markets, especially for names that are lower investment-grade or sub-investment-grade candidates. And so I believe that that will continue. And there will be other transactions that we hope to get over the finish line that we can speak to. That will again be first-time candidates. And yes, we feel like that that will continue to grow.\nEric Wolfe: That\u2019s helpful. And then you look at the 10-year or whatever interest rate you want to look at and it\u2019s up pretty meaningfully over the last couple of weeks. When you see moves like this and how quickly will you adjust your pricing on future acquisitions or potentially even re-trade some deals, just trying to understand how sort of real-time capital market volatility changes and return all those?\nSumit Roy: Yes. So Eric, I\u2019m going to have Jonathan talk a little bit about things that we try to do to anticipate what I\u2019ll call unanticipated movements in 10 years, okay? We talk about a hedging strategy that we have in place. But I just want to make one point very clear. Our cost of capital gets mark-to-market pretty much by the second. That\u2019s not how cap rates move. There is absolutely a lag time, how sticky these movements, these upward movements and the cost of capital -- people have a different opinion about how sticky that is. And that drives their view around what cap rates should be. And it does take time for people to adjust to a higher cost of capital environment. And if there\u2019s a lot of volatility that makes that adjustment period that much more difficult. So yes, we\u2019ve seen movements on the 10-year from 3.86 to 4.17, 4.18 today within a matter of days, you\u2019re not going to see a 30 basis-point movement in cap rates to reflect this movement in 10-years, unless we see that this 4.7 -- I mean, 4.17, God forbid, 4.7. 4.17, 4.2 become a more sustainable rate. But then what do we do balance sheet perspective to sort of anticipate those situations? I\u2019ll have Jonathan speak to that.\nJonathan Pong: Thanks, Sumit. We\u2019ve been very active on the hedging front, both for FX, which I alluded to earlier, but also on the interest rate front. If you look at the 10-Q from the first quarter, you\u2019ll see that we actually purchased swaptions, which really go out until January of next year that protects us against rising rates on the tender. The reason why we chose 1 billion, the reason why we went out to January is because we do have some debt maturities coming up of around $1 billion, $1.1 billion in the first quarter of next year. We put those hedges in place in late March, early April and as far as you might imagine, it\u2019s pretty healthily in the money right now. So from that standpoint, we\u2019ve taken out the primary balance sheet risk -- or refi risk that we have coming up over the 6 to 9 months, but we\u2019re always going to look for opportunities where we see a risk, we want to be proactive. We can\u2019t time to market, but what we can do is mitigate the exposure that we have on potential risk. And so -- that\u2019s something that we\u2019ve done now twice, and the first time we did it was the middle of pandemic, and we were able to monetize that what swapped at a $72 million gain. We\u2019re not always going to be so fortunate, but that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about managing risk.\nOperator: The next question comes from Wes Golladay of Baird.\nWes Golladay: Can you talk about what\u2019s going on in the UK? It looks like volume was low. I\u2019m just curious if this is a function of just low deal volume, or is it just pricing, just lagging still over there?\nSumit Roy: Yes. Neil needs to work a little bit harder, I think. It really is a timing issue as we had some great momentum towards the end of last year driven by pressures that funds were experiencing on the redemption side and it created some amazing opportunities for us. That momentum continued into the first quarter. Second quarter was still very healthy. We did about $420 million which is a big number, but it\u2019s just -- it got dominated by what we did on the U.S. side, largely driven by the $1.5 billion. If you take that $1.5 billion away, and you look at what we\u2019ve done, we were at $1.6 billion, of which the European -- the international business represented, I would say, trying to do a quick math right around 30%. So -- and that\u2019s generally been where the international business has contributed. But look, I\u2019m very excited about that business, and there\u2019s more to come.\nWes Golladay: Okay. It sounds good. And yes, good job, Neil. That\u2019s actually good volume once adjusted. I guess next question is more bigger picture. I\u2019m kind of curious what your opinion would be, what is the bigger risk to net lease? Would it be inflation and potentially having this price escalators, would it be tenant credit at this point of the cycle?\nSumit Roy: I would think it\u2019s tenant credit. You\u2019ll have to look at all of the various different net lease businesses and take a view on where do you see the credit risk largely driven by these inflationary pressures, the persistence of those inflationary pressures which then obviously is resulting in this higher interest rate environment. I think that\u2019s going to sort of filter through and it will impact net lease businesses, net lease companies differently, depending on the makeup of where their exposure lies. For me, one of the advantages that we have is, do we -- can we perfectly match inflation with -- of the inherent growth rates that we have, we can\u2019t. So there\u2019s always going to be a bit of a mismatch. But have we, and now I\u2019m talking about Realty Income, done a much better job of growing the inherent growth profile of our leases? The answer is a categorical yes. Today -- and I think it was part of my prepared remarks, our overall portfolio, if you were to do nothing, will grow by 1.5% and on a levered basis closer to 2%. Some of it is actually benefited from non-capped CPIs that we\u2019ve been able to get on one-third of the assets that have CPI growth rates built into them in the international markets. And those have contributed greatly to increasing our inherent growth rate. So, it\u2019s never going to be perfectly matched, but the risk of not having a perfectly matched growth rate inherent in your leases is somewhat muted versus credit risks that could translate into much bigger impact on your overall business.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ronald Kamdem of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRonald Kamdem: Just two quick ones. Staying on the tenant credit risk. So, I see occupancy 99%; median EBITDA, it looks like it ticked up 2.8% versus 2.7% last quarter. And I know that\u2019s reported with a lag, but still pretty interesting. And I think in your opening comments, you mentioned that basically the watch list was the lowest sort of ever. So things are certainly feeling pretty good. But as you sort of look forward, when you hear stuff like student loans starting again for property insurance in Florida. Just sort of curious, how does your team sort of stress test that or think about that, what the potential impact did it have on the tenant side? Thanks.\nSumit Roy: Yes. Good question, Ronald. And just to clarify, it wasn\u2019t the last five years that I said that our credit watch list is in the 3s. It\u2019s the lowest it\u2019s been in the last five years. Those are very good questions. what is it when student loans get instituted back again and discretionary income falls? What are the first things to go? It\u2019s going to be discretionary spend, right? And if you look at the portfolio that we\u2019ve created that largely consist of nondiscretionary, low-price point, service-oriented businesses, these are things that will be the last to go. Could they be impacted? Of course, they can. But when you have discretionary income that is getting compressed, those are not going to be the types of businesses that will get impacted first. And that\u2019s how we\u2019ve constituted our portfolio of assets is being very much focused on what are the industries that are going to be a lot more resilient under economic conditions like the one that we are facing today. So, it is not by luck that we find ourselves with a credit watch list that is circa 3.7%. It is by design. And that\u2019s how we run our business, Ronald.\nRonald Kamdem: Great. And then my second one was just -- so going back to guidance a little bit and taking a step back thinking about this year, just can you -- what are the big two or three sort of comp issues that the guidance was facing this year? I think you hit on one, which is the interest cost sort of headwind, right, for this year. But presumably, that\u2019s not going to be an issue for \u201824 because the comp just is not as tough. But was there anything else sort of onetimey or unique to this year, it could be property tax, it could be whatever that we should be mindful of, for \u201823 that maybe does not sort of happen again in \u201824?\nJonathan Pong: Hey Ron, it\u2019s Jonathan. I\u2019ll say -- I\u2019ll expand on what I said earlier regarding short-term rates. We talked about the impact to the back half of this year. But when you really zoom out and you look at year-over-year versus all of 2022 versus 2023, it\u2019s even a greater impact. It\u2019s closer to $0.07 or $0.08, which based off the midpoint of our guide is about 2%. And so, you take that out and on a normalized basis, the volume that we\u2019re doing, everything that we\u2019re doing from a portfolio and asset management standpoint, we\u2019re trending closer to a 5% number year-over-year if you were at 3.1% this quarter. The first quarter did have a little bit of a tougher comp, if you recall the first quarter of 2022. We did have a significant reserve reversal in the other industry. So that\u2019s why the first quarter was a little bit flat. Second quarter outside of rates is getting back more towards a normalized level. So, back half of the year, I think you\u2019ll continue to see some difficult comps on the SOFR front. And given that we do have even an 8%, 10% exposure to variable rates, just given the magnitude of the move, that\u2019s going to be the biggest difference.\nOperator: The next question comes from Linda Tsai of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nLinda Tsai: Just going back to your comment regarding the stickiness of cap rates, the investment spread of 133 basis points. How does that vary between international and domestic investments? And where would you see investment spreads in those two categories trending?\nSumit Roy: Yes. If you actually follow the headline cap rates that we are registering, I think the international business was 20 basis points higher. So, that should answer your question, Linda. But, again, this is going to be very much a product-by-product opportunity-by-opportunity discussion in terms of what is the actual spread that we are going to realize, and is there an advantage between the domestic markets and the international markets. I think the advantages are very different. Here in the U.S. market, there\u2019s clearly more competition, there are more players. In the international markets, we don\u2019t experience that. The U.S. market, however, is a much more mature sale-leaseback market. And so there are more opportunities that one can participate in, whereas I would say the international market is still in the nascent stages of sale-leaseback as a viable product. It is maturing, but it is behind the curve. And for us, what we want to try to do is position ourselves in both these markets and work from our points of strength that allows us to then win transactions. Our average has been 150 basis points of spread from the time we\u2019ve been tracking spreads. And first quarter, it was 200 basis points, based on realized capital that we raised to actually help finance our business. This quarter, based on, again, the same method, it\u2019s 133 basis points. So, if you average out year-to-date, it\u2019s still north of what our 150 basis points historical average has been. But it\u2019s very difficult, Linda to tell you, going forward, you\u2019re going to have one geography that is going to dominate the spread versus another. It\u2019s very much opportunity-driven.\nLinda Tsai: Got it. And then I think you said 30% of your international leases have uncapped CPI. What is the nature of those tenants that are open to that versus the other 70% of leases that don\u2019t have uncapped?\nSumit Roy: Yes. Linda, let me be a bit more precise. Of the international leases that have CPI as the driver of internal growth, one third or 30% of them are uncapped. So not all of our leases in the international markets have CPI drivers of internal growth. So, I just want to make that clarification. And again, it is very much a function of the market. A market that is used to seeing CPI growth as the metric for -- in their leases, they\u2019re far more receptive to continuing to see that. Now there has been some pushback given just the sheer magnitude of inflation that\u2019s being experienced in some of these markets, and we are trying to be commercial about that. But, it\u2019s very difficult suddenly to go to a client here who happens to be an investment-grade client and say, \"Sorry, we want CPI growth\", you\u2019re not going to get that. So yes, we see -- we tend to see more uncapped CPI growth in the international markets than we do here. And yes, but that too is evolving.\nOperator: The next question comes from Harsh Hemnani of Green Street.\nHarsh Hemnani: Sumit, you mentioned that in the past, sourcing, what you close is roughly 7% of what you\u2019ve sourced. And this quarter, it was closer to 15%. Do you worry at all of the net lease transaction market sort of continues to remain illiquid and at Realty Income, you\u2019re closing $5 billion to $7 billion annually, that you might not have the luxury to be as selective as you were in the past and maybe you have to execute on your second or third best idea. How are you thinking about that looking over the next 12 months?\nSumit Roy: Well, the good news, Harsh, is that we haven\u2019t gone to executing on our second or third best ideas yet. We\u2019re very fortunate. Let me shed some light on this 15% closing rather than what we\u2019ve traditionally done, which is the 7% to 10%. What is skewing this is clearly the $1.5 billion transaction that we closed on in the second quarter, but it\u2019s not reflected in the denominator in the sourcing volume of $15 billion. We had sourced that asset, I would say, probably in the fourth quarter of last year. So, that\u2019s where the mismatch occurs. In some ways the sourcing volume is much more real time, what did we see. And there is generally a lag between when we engage in a conversation, i.e., when it is sourced versus when does that particular transaction get over the finish line or closes. And I think that lag sometimes does create this mismatch. So, if we were to sort of take away the $1.5 billion and then look at the $1.6 billion that we ended up closing in a year that -- in a quarter where we source $15 billion, $16 billion, that\u2019s still 10%. So, I think that\u2019s probably the way to think about this mismatch that we saw in the second quarter.\nHarsh Hemnani: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then the $1.6 trillion that you provided that there\u2019s $1.6 trillion of commercial real estate on S&P 500 company balance sheet. How much of that is real estate that you would actually want to have in your portfolio? So, I imagine you\u2019re not actively acquiring office assets. Could you share how much of that is maybe retail gaming, et cetera, that you might go after?\nSumit Roy: Yes. That\u2019s a great question, Harsh, and we did that when we talk about $4 trillion here in the U.S. and $8 trillion in Europe. And just to be also super clear about this particular statistics that we shared in the prepared remarks. It does not include other real estate companies. It does not include certain sectors like finance companies, banks, energy companies, et cetera, et cetera. These are operating businesses that have assets. And an easy way to think about it is, let\u2019s assume that half of it is office. Let\u2019s assume that another 20% of it is something that we wouldn\u2019t want. Even if it is 20% or 30% of this $1.6 trillion, that is a massive number. And the point is that these are companies that are going to have to refinance their debt, this $1.2 trillion of debt over the next three years. It\u2019s maturing over the next 3 years. And sale-leaseback should be a conversation that is appealing to them, especially given the cost of doing a sale-leaseback today in this environment versus the cost of refinancing that a lot of these companies are going to experience. That\u2019s really the point.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Sumit Roy for any closing remarks.\nSumit Roy: Thank you all for joining us today. We\u2019re looking forward to seeing many of you at the various conferences this fall. Have a good rest of your summer. Bye, bye.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation, and you may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Sumit. It's an honor to serve our colleagues, Board and stakeholders during this exciting time at Realty Income. As we previously announced at the end of this year, I will be retiring as CFO and passing our CFO baton to Jonathan Pong, who is our current Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Finance. Jonathan has been with the Company for the last nine years and brings significant experience to the role, having overseen our capital markets, investor relations, FP&A and derivatives functions during his time here. Over the last 2.5 years, since joining the management team, we have worked closely together as part of a planned succession, and Jonathan is well positioned to carry the torch moving forward. With that, I would like to hand the call over to Jonathan to go over the financial results from our quarter."
        },
        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Sumit Roy",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve. Welcome, everyone. We successfully executed on our strategy in the second quarter and continue to see momentum across the business. I would like to sincerely thank our One Team whose focus and commitment to continue to propel our business forward, serving all our clients and stakeholders. We believe the strength of our platform and quality of our real estate portfolio were evident in the quarter's results. Despite a challenging interest rate environment, AFFO per share grew 3.1% from last year to $1 per share. Combined with our dividend, we are pleased to have delivered a total operational return of over 8% on a trailing 12-month basis. Delivering stable and consistent growth is foundational to our mission at Realty Income. Underlying this growth, our team continues to source and invest in high-quality properties at accretive spreads to our cost of capital while partnering with our clients who are leaders in nondiscretionary, low-price point and service-oriented industries. Partnering with industry leaders across over 13,000 properties in a diversified real estate portfolio offers us durability of cash flows that results in the predictable nature of our revenues, earnings and dividend payments. Our investment activities remain robust as we continue to demonstrate that size and scale are unique advantages in the sale-leaseback and portfolio transaction markets. In the second quarter, we closed on approximately $3.1 billion of high-quality real estate investments, which brings our year-to-date investment activity to over $4.7 billion. Cap rates in our acquisitions appear to have stabilized after a meaningful adjustment period to a higher interest rate environment. Though in select situations, we continue to find unique opportunities to source and close on larger transactions where our relationships, platform and access to capital allow us to take advantage of more favorable terms. Our second quarter initial cash lease yield of 6.9% represents a 120 basis-point increase compared to the second quarter of 2022 and resulted in a realized investment spread of approximately 133 basis points when calculating our WACC on a leverage-neutral basis using the cost of equity and debt raised in the quarter. In addition to closing our $1.5 billion U.S. convenience store acquisition from the EG Group, we remained active internationally during the second quarter, closing on $416 million of investments at an initial cash lease yield of 7.1%. This international activity includes the addition of a new geographic vertical in Ireland where we acquired two properties for $54 million at healthy cash yields. Given the transaction velocity we have achieved in the first half of the year, we are increasing our outlook for investments to over $7 billion for 2023. Year-to-date, we have acquired 15% of source investment volume compared to an average of 7% over the last five years. In today's more constrained environment for capital, we have found the size and scale of our platform have become increasingly meaningful differentiators as we seek accretive growth opportunities. Shifting to operations, our portfolio continues to perform, and we ended the quarter with occupancy of 99%, the third consecutive quarter at that level. This matches our highest occupancy at the end of a reporting period in over 20 years. Additionally, our rent recapture rates increased from last quarter to 103.4% across 201 new and renewed leases, bringing the year-to-date recapture rate to 102.7% across 377 new or renewed leases executed in the period. As further testament to the stability of our portfolio and the leading clients with whom we partner, our client watch list declined from last quarter and now represent less than 4% of our annualized rental revenue. This is the lowest level in the last five years. Finally, our same-store rental revenue increased 2.0% in the quarter, a tangible result of our purposeful decision to seek investment opportunities with higher internal growth characteristics as well as the benefit of uncapped CPI-based rent escalators, present in nearly 30% of the leases in our growing international portfolio. Our efforts to increasingly pursue leases with meaningful contractual rent escalators has helped contribute to a portfolio with contractual rent growth at approximately 1.5% per annum as of the second quarter, or 2% annual growth on a levered basis. Before turning it over to Christie, I would like to recognize the tremendous value she has brought to Realty Income, first as a Board member, and then as Chief Financial Officer. Her leadership and counsel through a very active period for our company has left a lasting positive mark. As well, I would also like to congratulate Jonathan on his upcoming promotion to CFO. Christie? Thank you, Jonathan. As our second quarter results illustrate, our company is well positioned to provide consistent results in a variety of economic environments and to grow through a variety of different acquisition channels. The optionality we have to toggle between different sources of capital is also a competitive advantage as it broadens our reach of investors and oftentimes provides a lower cost of capital alternative to the public U.S. dollar market. Looking at the S&P 500 constituents within our addressable market, we count approximately 300 firms with $1.6 trillion of owned real estate. To quantify the near-term opportunity, which is available to us as sale-leaseback capital providers, this group has approximately $1.2 trillion of debt representing 34% of the group's outstanding debt capital maturing between 2024 and 2027. Meanwhile, corporate bond deals have risen anywhere between 240 and 400 basis points from the 2021 average to today. This compares to a 140 basis-point increase in initial cash lease yields for Realty Income's investments over the same time frame, making our capital solutions even more competitively priced on a relative basis than in the past. Because of this cost of capital convergence and because of the many benefits sale-leaseback financing provides, including the elimination of maturity risk, we believe there is a more compelling case to be made than ever for corporates to look to sale-leaseback financing to replace maturing debt. As the attractiveness of sale-leaseback financing accelerates for corporates with looming debt maturities and elevated debt costs, we believe our growth opportunities will continue to expand on a sustainable basis. At this time, we can open it up for questions. Operator? So Nate, I'll take your second question first, and then I'll hand it off to Jonathan to talk about puts and takes with regards to the earnings guidance. With regards to the cap rate, we are assuming the cap rate to be within the ZIP code that we've announced in the second quarter and in the first quarter. That's where we believe where the cap rates have settled down. Opportunistically, there are situations that we could enter into where we could drive those cap rates higher. But for modeling purposes, I would request that you keep it within these ZIP codes that we've announced in the first and second quarter. Jonathan? I guess, we have to post one of these large transactions per quarter. And I think we've done that. If you look at what we've done in the fourth quarter of last year, that's when we closed on the gaming asset, which was $1.7 billion. You look at the large portfolio deal we did in the first quarter, it was a CIM transaction. That was circa $900 million. And in the second quarter, we've announced the $1.5 billion and closed the $1.5 billion EG Group transaction. And look, the reason why we are sharing all of this data is to help support what we are seeing develop in our pipeline and the conversations that we are having currently. Now, how much of that gets translated to close transactions, time will tell. But clearly, we are very optimistic. And that is one of the main drivers of why we have increased our guidance by another $1 billion in terms of acquisitions. So, we just feel like -- I wish our cost of capital was slightly better. But in terms of actual transactions, we feel like the pipeline is robust and it's largely a function of what is happening in the debt capital market. Well, we think of ourselves as an investment company. And Greg, so where we invest on the capital stack is always available for debate within the four walls of Realty Income. And wherever we feel like we can quantify the risk and underwrite the benefits of doing a sale-leaseback versus doing a direct loan to one of our clients, we are going to go down the path of whichever yields the best risk-adjusted return. So, yes, we haven't done one of those, but it is certainly up for discussion, and it's one that we have been discussing with my colleagues here at Realty Income. Yes. So Brad, I've always stated this about the theater business that it is largely a function of content. And as long as the content continues to develop and it goes back to levels that it was pre-pandemic, which was circa 70, 75 big tent type releases, we're going to get back to levels pretty close to the revenue levels that we had in 2019. And anytime you have situations like the one that you've just described where you have a strike, it does obviously put a little bit of a breaker in terms of the ability of studios to continue to release those big tent movies. The good news in today's environment versus the last time there was a strike, which lasted, if I remember correctly from -- for about four months. The good news today is we've got a lot more studios beyond the big four that are releasing big budget movies, and I'd put Amazon and Netflix in the mix there. But yes, all else being equal, a strike is not a good thing. Do I see this having a near-term impact, I don't think so because a lot of these movies have already been completed, and it's just a question of staging the release. But longer term, it could have a disruption on how many of these movies get released. And so, we are watching this closely. I believe there's a meeting on Friday, where the studios are getting together with the writers and the actors and all of that. And my hope is that there's a resolution soon. And -- but yes, it is a situation that we are monitoring closely. But my expectation, if it is anything like what it was last time, this should resolve itself in the next couple of months. Yes. So Brad, I'm not going to give -- go into the details of the Cineworld situation, just because we haven't quite penned the contract yet. What I will say is that any of the potential economic outcomes have been completely reflected in our updated earnings guidance. So, that's how I'm going to leave it with the Cineworld situation. And I'll just add something to stuff that I've already talked about in the past, there will be a few assets that we expect to get back. And we have already started to look at what are the alternatives at those particular sites. And the gamut runs from a complete redevelopment of the site to an alternative use, i.e., industrial to situations where we have a retailer coming in and talking about potentially just taking the asset as is, even though they're not movie theater operators, to potentially re-entitling the asset for an alternative use and selling it, i.e., creating more value for ourselves. And the last bucket will be just selling the asset as is. So, all of those various permutations are being considered on a handful of assets that we expect will get rejected through this process. But, I'm not going to go into any more detail than that. Sure. Thank you for that question, Haendel. So just to continue to reiterate the point, we are not targeting investment-grade. What we are targeting are opportunities that yield the best risk-adjusted return. If it so happens that it is an investment-grade client and so be it. But ultimately, it's the economic profile of that investment that's going to dictate as to whether or not we are going to invest. Today, truth be told, we are looking at some of these investment-grade opportunities and cannot pencil the risk-adjusted returns. We are finding far more value in areas where we're looking at subinvestment-grade tenants who are willing to give us a return profile that is commensurate with the inherent risk in that particular opportunity. And that's what's driving the approximately 26% year-to-date investment-grade closings that we've done and is close to 18%, I think, for the second quarter. But that's how we think about the world. And the other thing I'd just point out is just to make it equivalent because I have seen some of these cap rates being reported and there's a bit of a mixed match. When we're talking about a 6.9% cash lease yield, if you layer in the straight line, we're talking about an additional 100 basis points. And I've seen certain reports that are sort of conflating these two numbers. So just to make it apples-to-apples, our straight line yields are closer to 7.9% on $3.1 billion worth of acquisitions. That's where we are seeing the value, with, I would argue, much better growth profile. And clearly, that's represented in the 100 basis points of increase when compared to cash yields. So that's how you should think about us Haendel. And if it just so happens that this dynamic were to shift and suddenly investment-grade was to go back to our 40%, 45% that we have in our portfolio, then that will be it. But it's not something that we target, and you shouldn't expect us to be targeting that number going forward. Sure. So again, I'm not going to talk about specifics, but I'll repeat what I've said in the past about our desire to grow our gaming vertical. We are obviously looking at many opportunities. And thankfully, it's a fairly robust environment today for gaming. And yes, in terms of how we're going to view these opportunities, it's along the lines of how I answered the previous question. So that's what you should expect from us for this particular vertical. Yes. Very good question, Joshua. As you know, when you enter into transactions that have a long duration associated with it, which is what development by its very definition, is going to have. It does become a function of when were those transactions entered into and what's the duration of that build-out period. And so, what you might have noticed is if you're tracking our development yields over the last few quarters, you've noticed a marked increase in those cash yields on developments. It's largely a function of when did we strike those. So things that you're starting to see filter through in the second quarter, which has a similar yield to what you saw on the domestic side, it's largely a function of us having entered into those transactions over the last two to three quarters, when we were anticipating a much higher interest rate environment and therefore, being able to work with our clients to get that yield reflected in the development cycle. And you should continue to see that. Trends slightly higher looking into the next few quarters as some of the older generation development opportunities start to sort of get fully developed and are -- become cash paying opportunities. So I think just keep a close eye on that and that's the trend you should see manifest itself over the next few quarters. Thanks for the question, Michael. I might have actually said it four times. I'm not sure. I just believe in it so much. And it's really not something that we believe. It's what we are hearing. When we are engaging in these conversations with clients who are big clients who have big questions that they're trying to answer, it's the fact that who gets invited to the table. And when we see that we are the only REIT in the net lease space at the table competing against private sources of capital, that in itself gives us continued confidence that we are playing a game that is very different from some of our smaller peers. And we want to be that. We want to be the real estate partners of choice for the S&P 500 names. We want to be the first name that is considered when we -- when folks think about -- they have the ability to write big checks. They have the ability to stand by what it is they say. Their reputation speaks for itself and their ability to close is bar none. And when we hear those comments from clients who work with us and more recently with some of our new clients who've been added to our registry, it gives us continued confidence to say that our scale and size is being appreciated within this space. I can't give you percentages, Eric. But what I can point to is just look at some of the larger transactions we've done and who have we done it with. And they're all first time sale-leaseback candidates, right? Think about Wind. [ph] They were -- they've never done a sale-leaseback before, and they chose to do it with us. Think about EG Group they've never done a sale-leaseback before. Their best chance of doing a sale-leaseback was when they actually ended up being the winners in the Cumberland Farms portfolio. This was three, four years ago. And they chose not to do it at that time. And so part of the reason why I believe that sale-leaseback as a product is maturing, is certainly driven by the capital markets environment that we find ourselves in and suddenly finding that sale-leaseback as an alternative to raise capital is quite beneficial vis-a\u0300-vis as we were traditionally being compared to the debt capital markets, especially for names that are lower investment-grade or sub-investment-grade candidates. And so I believe that that will continue. And there will be other transactions that we hope to get over the finish line that we can speak to. That will again be first-time candidates. And yes, we feel like that that will continue to grow. Yes. So Eric, I'm going to have Jonathan talk a little bit about things that we try to do to anticipate what I'll call unanticipated movements in 10 years, okay? We talk about a hedging strategy that we have in place. But I just want to make one point very clear. Our cost of capital gets mark-to-market pretty much by the second. That's not how cap rates move. There is absolutely a lag time, how sticky these movements, these upward movements and the cost of capital -- people have a different opinion about how sticky that is. And that drives their view around what cap rates should be. And it does take time for people to adjust to a higher cost of capital environment. And if there's a lot of volatility that makes that adjustment period that much more difficult. So yes, we've seen movements on the 10-year from 3.86 to 4.17, 4.18 today within a matter of days, you're not going to see a 30 basis-point movement in cap rates to reflect this movement in 10-years, unless we see that this 4.7 -- I mean, 4.17, God forbid, 4.7. 4.17, 4.2 become a more sustainable rate. But then what do we do balance sheet perspective to sort of anticipate those situations? I'll have Jonathan speak to that. Yes. Neil needs to work a little bit harder, I think. It really is a timing issue as we had some great momentum towards the end of last year driven by pressures that funds were experiencing on the redemption side and it created some amazing opportunities for us. That momentum continued into the first quarter. Second quarter was still very healthy. We did about $420 million which is a big number, but it's just -- it got dominated by what we did on the U.S. side, largely driven by the $1.5 billion. If you take that $1.5 billion away, and you look at what we've done, we were at $1.6 billion, of which the European -- the international business represented, I would say, trying to do a quick math right around 30%. So -- and that's generally been where the international business has contributed. But look, I'm very excited about that business, and there's more to come. I would think it's tenant credit. You'll have to look at all of the various different net lease businesses and take a view on where do you see the credit risk largely driven by these inflationary pressures, the persistence of those inflationary pressures which then obviously is resulting in this higher interest rate environment. I think that's going to sort of filter through and it will impact net lease businesses, net lease companies differently, depending on the makeup of where their exposure lies. For me, one of the advantages that we have is, do we -- can we perfectly match inflation with -- of the inherent growth rates that we have, we can't. So there's always going to be a bit of a mismatch. But have we, and now I'm talking about Realty Income, done a much better job of growing the inherent growth profile of our leases? The answer is a categorical yes. Today -- and I think it was part of my prepared remarks, our overall portfolio, if you were to do nothing, will grow by 1.5% and on a levered basis closer to 2%. Some of it is actually benefited from non-capped CPIs that we've been able to get on one-third of the assets that have CPI growth rates built into them in the international markets. And those have contributed greatly to increasing our inherent growth rate. So, it's never going to be perfectly matched, but the risk of not having a perfectly matched growth rate inherent in your leases is somewhat muted versus credit risks that could translate into much bigger impact on your overall business. Yes. Good question, Ronald. And just to clarify, it wasn't the last five years that I said that our credit watch list is in the 3s. It's the lowest it's been in the last five years. Those are very good questions. what is it when student loans get instituted back again and discretionary income falls? What are the first things to go? It's going to be discretionary spend, right? And if you look at the portfolio that we've created that largely consist of nondiscretionary, low-price point, service-oriented businesses, these are things that will be the last to go. Could they be impacted? Of course, they can. But when you have discretionary income that is getting compressed, those are not going to be the types of businesses that will get impacted first. And that's how we've constituted our portfolio of assets is being very much focused on what are the industries that are going to be a lot more resilient under economic conditions like the one that we are facing today. So, it is not by luck that we find ourselves with a credit watch list that is circa 3.7%. It is by design. And that's how we run our business, Ronald. Yes. If you actually follow the headline cap rates that we are registering, I think the international business was 20 basis points higher. So, that should answer your question, Linda. But, again, this is going to be very much a product-by-product opportunity-by-opportunity discussion in terms of what is the actual spread that we are going to realize, and is there an advantage between the domestic markets and the international markets. I think the advantages are very different. Here in the U.S. market, there's clearly more competition, there are more players. In the international markets, we don't experience that. The U.S. market, however, is a much more mature sale-leaseback market. And so there are more opportunities that one can participate in, whereas I would say the international market is still in the nascent stages of sale-leaseback as a viable product. It is maturing, but it is behind the curve. And for us, what we want to try to do is position ourselves in both these markets and work from our points of strength that allows us to then win transactions. Our average has been 150 basis points of spread from the time we've been tracking spreads. And first quarter, it was 200 basis points, based on realized capital that we raised to actually help finance our business. This quarter, based on, again, the same method, it's 133 basis points. So, if you average out year-to-date, it's still north of what our 150 basis points historical average has been. But it's very difficult, Linda to tell you, going forward, you're going to have one geography that is going to dominate the spread versus another. It's very much opportunity-driven. Yes. Linda, let me be a bit more precise. Of the international leases that have CPI as the driver of internal growth, one third or 30% of them are uncapped. So not all of our leases in the international markets have CPI drivers of internal growth. So, I just want to make that clarification. And again, it is very much a function of the market. A market that is used to seeing CPI growth as the metric for -- in their leases, they're far more receptive to continuing to see that. Now there has been some pushback given just the sheer magnitude of inflation that's being experienced in some of these markets, and we are trying to be commercial about that. But, it's very difficult suddenly to go to a client here who happens to be an investment-grade client and say, \"Sorry, we want CPI growth\", you're not going to get that. So yes, we see -- we tend to see more uncapped CPI growth in the international markets than we do here. And yes, but that too is evolving. Well, the good news, Harsh, is that we haven't gone to executing on our second or third best ideas yet. We're very fortunate. Let me shed some light on this 15% closing rather than what we've traditionally done, which is the 7% to 10%. What is skewing this is clearly the $1.5 billion transaction that we closed on in the second quarter, but it's not reflected in the denominator in the sourcing volume of $15 billion. We had sourced that asset, I would say, probably in the fourth quarter of last year. So, that's where the mismatch occurs. In some ways the sourcing volume is much more real time, what did we see. And there is generally a lag between when we engage in a conversation, i.e., when it is sourced versus when does that particular transaction get over the finish line or closes. And I think that lag sometimes does create this mismatch. So, if we were to sort of take away the $1.5 billion and then look at the $1.6 billion that we ended up closing in a year that -- in a quarter where we source $15 billion, $16 billion, that's still 10%. So, I think that's probably the way to think about this mismatch that we saw in the second quarter. Yes. That's a great question, Harsh, and we did that when we talk about $4 trillion here in the U.S. and $8 trillion in Europe. And just to be also super clear about this particular statistics that we shared in the prepared remarks. It does not include other real estate companies. It does not include certain sectors like finance companies, banks, energy companies, et cetera, et cetera. These are operating businesses that have assets. And an easy way to think about it is, let's assume that half of it is office. Let's assume that another 20% of it is something that we wouldn't want. Even if it is 20% or 30% of this $1.6 trillion, that is a massive number. And the point is that these are companies that are going to have to refinance their debt, this $1.2 trillion of debt over the next three years. It's maturing over the next 3 years. And sale-leaseback should be a conversation that is appealing to them, especially given the cost of doing a sale-leaseback today in this environment versus the cost of refinancing that a lot of these companies are going to experience. That's really the point. Thank you all for joining us today. We're looking forward to seeing many of you at the various conferences this fall. Have a good rest of your summer. Bye, bye."

            "name": "Jonathan Pong",
            "content": "Thank you, Christie. I would be remiss without acknowledging your many contributions to the Company and its stakeholders during your tenure. I'm grateful for your guidance, support and leadership, all of which have laid the foundation for excellence as our business continues to evolve. Over my 9-year, 10-year at Realty Income, we have experienced significant growth in new industry verticals, geographies and property types. However, we've continued to view a reliable growing dividend and a well-capitalized balance sheet as critical components of our business. To that end, we finished the second quarter with healthy leverage as measured by net debt to annualized pro forma adjusted EBITDA of 5.3 times and our fixed charge coverage ratio remains solid at 4.6 times. We are once again active issuers of equity capital via the ATM, raising approximately $2.2 billion in the aggregate in the second quarter, $651 million of unsettled forward equity remains outstanding as of today. As our platform has advanced and grown over time, our investment spread business has been supported by access to a wide range of products in the capital markets. Last month, we added another capital source to our inventory, raising \u20ac1.1 billion through our debut public offering of euro-denominated unsecured bonds. This dual tranche offering resulted in a weighted average tenure of 9 years and a weighted average annual yield to maturity of 5.08%. Establishing a presence in the euro unsecured bond market allowed us to diversify our fixed income investor base, and generate a natural hedge for yield denominated earnings and access of source of debt capital that was priced approximately 60 basis points inside of indicative U.S. dollar bond pricing at the time of execution. Proceeds from the offering effectively repaid short-term borrowings on a multicurrency revolver and commercial paper programs, which had a combined balance of $990 million at quarter end. Combined with $254 million of cash on hand at quarter end and the $650 million of forward equity previously mentioned, we believe we are well capitalized with significant liquidity heading into the third quarter. Finally, from an earnings outlook perspective, the midpoint of our 2023 AFFO per share guidance is unchanged, though we are narrowing the guidance range of $3.96 to $4.01, representing approximately 1.8% growth at the midpoint. With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Sumit. Hey Nate, on the guidance question, I would, first of all say, the midpoint of our guide is the same as the as it was at the start of the year. And so, when you think about how we put guidance together, there's a lot of puts and takes that we look at, at the beginning of the year, revisit at every quarter. We know that on a probability-weighted basis, not all of the takes are going to happen and all the puts are going to happen. And so when you think about acquisition guidance increasing two quarters now, that was a scenario that we had expected at the start of the year, but there was always going to be puts and takes that could offset that a bit. I think the biggest one for us has been short-term interest rates. When you look at what was implied back in January and February on the SOFR forward curve, you compare that to what it is implying today, about a 40 basis-point increase. And so that alone is $0.01 per share for our business in the back half of the year. So I would say that, and there's also some other things that we always get that maybe we're taking a slightly more conservative view on over the second half of the year appropriately, but we feel very good about being more or less accurate from what we came out at the start of the year. Yes, Nate. We're not going to go crazy and have significantly more liabilities denominated in one currency relative to the assets we have denominated in that same currency, especially when it's foreign denominated. And so for us, when we're going out and issuing in various currencies, we're thinking about the income statement, FX risk that we might have, and we're using the natural interest expense in that currency to serve as a hedge. If we don't have that, there's not a lot of reason for us to go out and do that type of issuance. We also know that we have a very active acquisition pipeline across all currencies. We know that we're going to need the capital at some point really denominated in dollars, sterling or euro. So, that's how we think about it. It was a 60 basis-point pickup relative to comparable U.S. dollar, but for us, it's really about diversification. And so, you can expect us to utilize everything in our toolkit going forward. But I think we are all set on the euro side, at least for the near term. Hey Josh. To address that, Sumit brought it up earlier, the impact of what we felt was the greatest uncertainty out there, the Cineworld resolution, tat impact is now that is known to us. And going into the quarter, it was something where there was a range of possibilities that we built into the high end and the low end. And so with a greater sense of confidence now where that's trending, we felt that it was appropriate to take the high end down by $0.02 in addition to bringing the low end up by $0.02. Thanks, Michael. I appreciate the question. I would say, look, what's made Realty Income so successful over the years, regardless of what we've done, what verticals we've established, it's commitment to a fortress balance sheet. And that's the one thing that is going to be sacrosanct to us for as long as we're in existence in these seats. And so, we're not going to sacrifice things like the A3 minus credit rating that we worked very hard to get. We're not going to sacrifice the trust of the fixed income community that now spans across three different currencies. And so, you're going to see us continue to focus on low leverage, plenty of liquidity and we're going to be very predictable from that standpoint. I think going forward, given the added complexity of the business, the volume, the transaction volume that we see, the different countries that we're in, and we'll continue to be in, I think it's really more of a focus on more of the internal operations now. The external side of things, I think we're pretty well established. We're going to continue to be creative. But I think it's about building and continuing this momentum on the internal platform that we've created, which we think is a differentiator in the net lease industry and frankly, in the real estate industry. Thanks, Sumit. We've been very active on the hedging front, both for FX, which I alluded to earlier, but also on the interest rate front. If you look at the 10-Q from the first quarter, you'll see that we actually purchased swaptions, which really go out until January of next year that protects us against rising rates on the tender. The reason why we chose 1 billion, the reason why we went out to January is because we do have some debt maturities coming up of around $1 billion, $1.1 billion in the first quarter of next year. We put those hedges in place in late March, early April and as far as you might imagine, it's pretty healthily in the money right now. So from that standpoint, we've taken out the primary balance sheet risk -- or refi risk that we have coming up over the 6 to 9 months, but we're always going to look for opportunities where we see a risk, we want to be proactive. We can't time to market, but what we can do is mitigate the exposure that we have on potential risk. And so -- that's something that we've done now twice, and the first time we did it was the middle of pandemic, and we were able to monetize that what swapped at a $72 million gain. We're not always going to be so fortunate, but that's how we're thinking about managing risk. Hey Ron, it's Jonathan. I'll say -- I'll expand on what I said earlier regarding short-term rates. We talked about the impact to the back half of this year. But when you really zoom out and you look at year-over-year versus all of 2022 versus 2023, it's even a greater impact. It's closer to $0.07 or $0.08, which based off the midpoint of our guide is about 2%. And so, you take that out and on a normalized basis, the volume that we're doing, everything that we're doing from a portfolio and asset management standpoint, we're trending closer to a 5% number year-over-year if you were at 3.1% this quarter. The first quarter did have a little bit of a tougher comp, if you recall the first quarter of 2022. We did have a significant reserve reversal in the other industry. So that's why the first quarter was a little bit flat. Second quarter outside of rates is getting back more towards a normalized level. So, back half of the year, I think you'll continue to see some difficult comps on the SOFR front. And given that we do have even an 8%, 10% exposure to variable rates, just given the magnitude of the move, that's going to be the biggest difference."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Realty Income First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please also note, today's event is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrea Behr, Associate Director of Corporate Communications. Please go ahead.\nAndrea Behr: Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's First Quarter Operating Results Conference Call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; Christie Kelly, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer; and Jonathan Pong, Senior Vice President, Head of Corporate Finance. During this conference call, we will make statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company's Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two-question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you would like to ask additional questions, you may reenter the queue. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy.\nSumit Roy : Thank you, Andrea. Welcome, everyone. We are pleased to report solid 2023 first quarter results, exhibiting continued momentum in our business. I would like to express my utmost gratitude to our One Team whose efforts enabled us to continue delivering on our growth objectives. I would also like to thank our equity and fixed income investors for their continued vote of confidence.  Our team's efforts and the benefits of our size and scale were reflected in our first quarter results, highlighted by approximately $1.7 billion of high-quality investments acquired at a cash cap rate of 7%. This represents a 90 basis point increase compared to the investment cash cap rate we achieved in the fourth quarter of last year and resulted in an investment spread of 163 basis points, which is above our historical averages. As we have experienced in prior cycles, cap rates for our investments after an adjustment period have historically tended to be positively correlated with interest rates, which is a trend we have largely continued to experience this year after the recent rise in rates. Our ability to access well-priced capital has historically served as a competitive advantage and is a testament to our long history of maintaining a conservative balance sheet and a diversified real estate portfolio, supported by clients who are leaders in their respective industries. Amidst an environment in which capital is expensive and are scarce for many of our clients, our value proposition is even more pronounced. This dynamic is reflected in the recent portfolio acquisitions we have announced, the active deal pipeline we see today and the favorable pricing spread we see for large portfolio transactions vis-a-vis one-off single asset transactions. Our differentiated platform extends beyond the external growth lens. Recently, we have taken steps to leverage the size of our portfolio and the history of our operating business through the continued development of advanced analytics. The objective of this initiative is to develop predictive and prescriptive insights that harness the collective proprietary data that we've accumulated over several decades of investing in managing and releasing single-tenant net lease properties. Our team's proprietary predictive analytic tool leverages the strove of information in our investment underwriting, portfolio management, asset management and development efforts enabling even more informed investment decisions made by our best-in-class One Team members.  As our business grows, so too will the predictive power of this tool, which we believe will generate significant value for our stakeholders as we refine the accuracy, test conclusions and broaden scope across industries, property types and geographies. As part of our core investment thesis, our size and scale have created opportunities to serve as a capital provider for best-in-class partners looking for alternative means of financing given elevated debt costs.  In the first quarter, we agreed to acquire up to 415 high-quality convenience stores from EG Group for $1.5 billion. Over 80% of the total portfolio annualized contractual rent is expected to be generated from properties under the Cumberland Farms brand, and we expect to close on this transaction in the second quarter. As illustrated by this deal, we believe our ability to offer not only certainty of close, but also attractively priced capital as a one-stop solution for sale-leaseback transactions is particularly valuable to institutional sellers of real estate today. We believe this will continue to expand our competitive advantage. Internationally, we continue to venture into new geographical verticals and grow the total addressable market opportunity. This quarter, we took advantage of favorable pricing internationally to acquire properties worth approximately $390 million at an initial cash lease yield of 7.6%. After our initial entry into international markets in 2019, we now derive 11.7% of total portfolio annualized contractual rent from those markets. This natural extension of our platform has been a pillar of growth for the last four years and is indicative of our ability to methodically establish and scale a new vertical.  Given the continued momentum in our acquisitions pipeline and our progress to date, we are increasing our 2023 investment guidance to over $6 billion from our prior guidance of over $5 billion. Consistent with our investment strategy, we remain disciplined with regard to our balance sheet. Subsequent to our April bond offering, which settled on April 14 and we held approximately $5.6 billion of liquidity, including unsettled forward equity totaling $1.5 billion. As a result, our current financial position has afforded us the ability to lean into near-term investment opportunities.  Moving to operations. Our platform continues to generate durable cash flows, which support our stable earnings profile. For the first quarter, we are pleased to report occupancy of 99%, matching last quarter for the highest rate at the end of a reporting period in over 20 years. Additionally, we generated a 101.7% recapture rate across 176 renewed or new leases executed during the quarter. These results are a reflection of our talented asset management team and our unwavering commitment to core capital allocation principles, which include a focus on industry-leading clients who often operate in a low price point service-based or nondiscretionary industries. Our purposeful diversification across industries, geographies and clients and our emphasis on high-quality real estate locations and rigorous credit underwriting. Our investment philosophy is nuanced and not simply predicated upon the pursuit of investment-grade clients, which ended the first quarter at 40.8% of our annualized contractual rent. Many of our strongest operators, such as Sainsbury's have no public debt and thus are not rated at all. However, the consistency of their operations and health of their balance sheet are favorable attributes that are consistent with those of an investment-grade rated company. We estimate that approximately 5.3% of our annualized contractual rent comes from unrated operators without public debt. We remain committed to investments that offer us attractive risk-adjusted returns as evidenced throughout our history. And going forward, where we believe, based upon our disciplined underwriting and analytics, we are achieving better returns per unit of incremental risk.  I would like to briefly touch on Cineworld which represents 1.3% of our annualized contractual rent. Despite the ongoing Chapter 11 bankruptcy, we have continued to receive 100% of contractual rent in the first quarter and through April. As of March 31, 2023, we had cumulative reserves of $33 million on our Cineworld properties. Outstanding receivables net of reserves and excluding straight-line receivables were $14.1 million. We remain in discussions with this client and we'll update the market on the outcome of these discussions at the appropriate time.  Before turning the call over to Christie, I would like to highlight that in March, we published our third annual sustainability report which details our ongoing commitment to operating as a responsible corporate citizen for our stockholders, our team, the communities in which we operate and the environment. I'm proud of our continued progress on ESG initiatives as we seek to fulfill our commitment to building sustainable relationships and I strongly encourage all of today's listeners to navigate to the Sustainability page of our website to review the report. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Christie.\nChristie Kelly: Thank you, Sumit. We work together with our clients and our One Team to achieve a successful quarter on a number of fronts, delivering AFFO per share of $0.98 on behalf of all of our stakeholders. We would highlight that the comparable quarter in 2022 benefited from approximately $10.2 million of rental revenue reserve reversals, resulting in an AFFO per share growth headwind of approximately $0.015 per share in the first quarter of 2023.  In addition, higher year-over-year short-term interest rates represented an approximate $0.02 growth headwind as our weighted average interest rate on revolver and commercial paper borrowings was approximately 300 basis points higher than it was in the comparative period in 2022 on a similar average borrowing base. Excluding these two items, our year-over-year AFFO per share growth rate was approximately 3.5% this quarter. As we evaluate the core fundamentals of our business, we remain focused upon delivering for our stakeholders over the long term and are encouraged by opportunities ahead.  To that end, we are increasing the low end of our AFFO per share guidance range by $0.01 resulting in a new range of $3.94 to $4.03, which represents 1.7% annual growth at the midpoint of the updated range. It has been a busy and productive start to the year on the capital raising front. Despite continued market volatility, we have raised approximately $3.9 billion of capital this year excluding $1.5 billion of unsettled forward equity. In April, we closed a $1 billion bond offering, which was comprised of $400 million of 4.7% senior unsecured notes due in 2028 and $600 million of 4.9% senior unsecured notes due in 2033, resulted in a weighted average tenure of eight years and semi-annual yield to maturity of 5.05%. The issuance allowed us to satisfy our near-term debt issuance needs while reducing our exposure to variable rate revolver and commercial paper borrowings and to almost zero after our transaction closed on April 14.  In March, we increased our dividend for the 120th time since our public listing in 1994, to an annual rate of $3.06 per share, representing 3.2% growth from the prior year period. Providing a stable and growing dividend is core to our mission at Realty Income, and we take great pride in being one of only 66 constituents in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index for having raised our dividend every year for the last 25 consecutive years. I would like to thank our One Team whose focus and diligence has paved the way for our continued growth as we build upon our track record of consistency.  And with that, I would like to turn it back over to Sumit.\nSumit Roy : Thank you, Christi. In conclusion, during periods of market uncertainty or dislocation we look to unearth value by leveraging the inherent advantages of our platform. These trends include our continued access to relatively attractively priced capital and our portfolio scale, which we seek to leverage to produce unique investment opportunities as a leading sale-leaseback capital provider. When combined with the collective talents of our best-in-class team members to source, underwrite and close on creative acquisition opportunities with strong risk-adjusted returns, we believe we are very well positioned to continue amplifying our competitive advantages on behalf of our clients and stakeholders. We thank all our stakeholders for their support, loyalty and trust in our company.  And with that, we can open it up for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Nate Crossett with BNP Paribas.\nNate Crossett : I was wondering if you could talk about just deal flow U.S. versus Europe. What was the amount of deals you looked at in the quarter? I think that's a number you usually give. And then on cap rates, last year, the spread of like the cap rates in the U.S. and Europe was pretty low. I think it was almost the same. But this quarter, Europe is 60 basis points wider. I just want to know if there's anything to note there.\nSumit Roy : Yes. Thank you for your questions, Nate. Good questions. Let's start with the sourcing numbers. For this quarter, we sourced about $16 billion worth of product, 25% of which was in the international markets. I would say that if you go back to when we started going into the international markets, the composition of international versus U.S. has been roughly around 30%, 70% in that ZIP code, plus/minus 5%. So this is pretty much within that particular range.  What you might have noticed, however, is the amount of closing more recently, both in the fourth quarter of last year, the first quarter of this year. The contribution from the international side has been a little bit lower than what you have traditionally seen. I would say that the international business has contributed about 35% of volume in terms of what we end up closing versus closer to 20%, 22% this particular quarter. And the main reason for that is we saw a delay in adjustments on the cap rate side in the international markets vis-a-vis the U.S. markets. We started to see cap rate expansion in the U.S. towards the end of -- middle of third quarter, fourth quarter and obviously through the first quarter of this year. But we didn't quite have the same experience in the UK market and some of the other international markets, till, I would say, towards the end of the fourth quarter. And what was largely making potential sellers reconsider the market was not so much driven by actual trades taking place, but more idiosyncratic to their particular needs. Around redemption issues or refinancings that were coming near term. And that's largely what's driven these opportunistic transactions that we've gotten over the finish line in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of last -- this year. And that's what's resulted in cap rates being substantially higher than what I would call the norm or what we are seeing in the everyday market in some of these international markets.  So that explains the 60 basis point higher cap rate that we were able to achieve. And I might add, this is excellent product largely driven by idiosyncratic issues being experienced by buyers who wanted to get this off their books to meet some of the things that I've just discussed. So that's the dynamic we've seen...\nNate Crossett : Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just one quick one on development yields. Those are notably below the acquisition yields. Are those just old commitments before rates moved? Or maybe you can describe what's happening there?\nSumit Roy : Yes. And Nate, you've hit the nail on the head. It's exactly that. As you know, development obligations have a much longer lead time. So a lot of what you see in -- you saw in the fourth quarter, third quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year, though it's starting to move up, it hasn't moved quite as quickly, largely because what you're seeing filtered through the investment numbers, but transactions that we hit struck, I would say, three quarters ago or four quarters ago. But you should expect to see the yield on development creep closer to what we are actually experiencing in the traditional acquisitions market over the next couple of quarters. So it's just a timing issue. \nOperator: And our next question today comes from Brad Heffern with RBC Capital Markets.\nBrad Heffern : Christie, one was wondering if you could talk through some of the puts and takes on guidance and why only the $0.01 increase at the low end given the increase in the acquisition guidance and the expense categories moving in the right direction?\nChristie Kelly : Absolutely, Brad. I think first, in terms of what Sumit had discussed and the increase of our acquisitions guidance to over $6 billion, we remain conservative in that front and really looking towards the second half of the year, while things remain strong. As Sumit has discussed, we're really wait and see here as things unfold. I think the other thing, too, in terms of guidance that we've articulated, and I mentioned some of this in my prepared remarks, is really the headwinds that we're seeing from a debt perspective, although we've been very focused on ensuring that we're derisking our balance sheet, and you can see that in the transactions that we've executed through April. We're really looking at where that may unfold in terms of the second half of the year and don't believe that, that will alleviate over and above the competitive cost of capital that we've been able to generate vis-a-vis last year. And I think finally, in terms of the positive trends that you saw in terms of the tightening of the guidance with G&A, we remain particularly disciplined during this macroeconomic backdrop, and are focused on managing our G&A. But further to that, it's the benefits of size and scale. And you can see that over the years in terms of the trends of G&A to revenues. And then finally, from an unreimbursed property expense margin perspective and the tightening there, we're just following in on the positive trends that we've been able to execute upon.\nBrad Heffern : Okay. And then, Sumit, just thinking about this EG Group deal, are you seeing more of these very large sale-leaseback opportunities versus what you would normally see? And then has the competition for those deals also thinned out?\nSumit Roy : No, no, Brad. I wouldn't go so far as to say it's timed out. In fact, the momentum has continued, and we expect that momentum to remain strong. I don't know how many billion-plus deals, but these large transactions what drives some of the near-term financing issues that a lot of companies are going to have to deal with. And with what we are seeing play out in the banking sector with fewer banks out there to provide capital, the cost of that capital being what it is, given the interest rate environment, I do believe that sale leaseback will continue to be a very attractive alternative to raise capital to help address financing needs at these companies. Keep in mind, EG had never done a sale leaseback. They had that option for many, many years. And they chose to go down this path largely to address some of the leverage concerns that they had on the balance sheet. And we expect that trend to continue. So -- and that's the reason why that's the impetus behind why we felt we should increase our acquisition guidance by $1 billion. \nOperator: And our next question today comes from Josh Dennerlein with Bank of America.\nJoshua Dennerlein : Just a follow-up on the EG Group deal. Just curious how that deal came together and maybe your ability to partner up further with them?\nSumit Roy : Thanks for the question, Josh. So EG is obviously a very well-established name in the U.K. market. Neil and I had been calling on them for a while, along with TDR Capital, they're capital providers for a while. And this is a relationship. We knew they didn't have a high level of interest in necessarily going down the path of sale leaseback when we first started to have conversations with them. But I think that, that relationship ultimately played out to our benefit when we were awarded the deal when they did choose to go down the path of sale leaseback to help meet some of their capital needs shorter term. This was a competitive process. It was run by Eastdil. We went through. We were obviously in close contact with EG directly as well. And there were three finalists, and we felt like we were awarded the deal based on our reputation, surety of close and the fact that we had spent time developing a relationship with them. So that's what really got us the deal at the end. And our ability to be creative and there were certain asks that they had and our ability to meet those certain asks also, I believe, accrue to our favor. So I think all of those factors went towards us being awarded the transaction despite us not being the highest bidder.\nJoshua Dennerlein : Okay. And then maybe changing the topic a little bit. How do you guys think about expanding or growing your exposure to lower credit quality tenants as a way to kind of widen the aperture and maintain growth?\nSumit Roy : Yes. Josh, that's a very good question. I'm actually going to go back to the EG Group conversation we just had. If you look at the actual portfolio, 80% of the portfolio is Cumberland Farms. And I just want to remind the group that three years ago, when Cumberland Farms was available for sale, they were all of the natural operators that were very, very interested in this very well-run private company. And what was being bandied about as a potential sale leaseback, the pricing was in the low 5s, high 4 ZIP code. And it ended up being EG Group that won the transaction, and they obviously didn't want any sale-leaseback financing to effectuate the buyout. But that was the quality of the real estate. That Cumberland Farms was demanding at that particular time. Fast forward today, the four-wall coverages on these assets have only improved and improved, I would say, dramatically. So the assets remain exactly the same assets, and we were able to accomplish this transaction at 6.9%.  Yes, if you look at EG Group, the credit that's operating these assets, they are sub-investment grade. But if you look at the quality of the assets, it's exactly the same. And we believe that EG Group is a very good operator of convenience store business. We can see that in the history that they have established in the UK, and we certainly see it in the performance of these assets. When you compare it to where they were performing three years ago and was warranting a price in the low 5s, high 4s to where we were able to accomplish. So now you fast forward and you say, okay, you're getting 150 basis points, 160 basis points of additional spread on this real estate, are you being paid for the credit risk inherent in the operator? And that's where the concept of risk-adjusted returns comes into play for us, and it is so front and center in everything we do. The answer for us was a resounding, yes. We are being compensated. And so for us, we've said this before that investment grade rating is a byproduct of the actual underwriting. It is not something that we seek out. It gets taken into consideration on the collectibility of the rent flow over the 20-year or 25-year leases that we underwrite to. But ultimately, we look at every transaction on a risk-adjusted basis. And if it makes sense, despite the fact that it may or may not have investment-grade rating is something that we are going to continue to pursue.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Michael Goldsmith of UBS.\nMichael Goldsmith : Sumit you started the call by talking about continued momentum in the business. Can you just talk a little -- REITs tend to be lagging indicators. So can you kind of talk about the visibility that you have into the business and this continued momentum? Just trying to better understand how long of a path that you have where you feel very good about the spreads and the backdrop? Because it seems like it's been -- everything has been pretty solid in the last several quarters.\nSumit Roy : Yes. That's a great question, Michael. Things are moving so fast. Every other day, there's a bank in the news. News is super fast. And so how do we think about our business and why do I use phrases like continued momentum. Even though this may be a lagging indicator, we are looking at transactions, these renewals every day. And when we are seeing the fact that we can still continue to generate 102%, 103% re-leasing spreads, yes, it's lagging, but literally weeks, months. And it gives me continued hope that, look, for our product, where we play in the market, et cetera, there continues to be a fair amount of demand. And it manifests itself in some of the positive re-leasing spreads that we share with the market. The second piece, which is much more of a forward-looking statement is what are the continued discussions that we are having that then helps drive our pipeline on the investment side. What are the kinds of discussions that we are having? What's the size of the discussions that we're having, what's the yield associated with those discussions. I think all of that gives us confidence that there continues to be momentum. The fact that we were able to raise $3.1 billion within a period of three months, in the fixed income market, the fact that we were able to close on $800 million of equity and have $1.5 million of unsettled equity available -- $1 billion, sorry, of unsettled equity, again continues to give me confidence that even on our capital side, for us, we continue to sit in a very favorable position. So we have the opportunity. We have the ability to raise capital. We have the ability to make spreads north of what we have historically achieved. And now with the international markets starting to reflect a little bit more of a positive movement for us on the cap rate side. That's what gives me confidence to say that we have continued momentum in the business.\nMichael Goldsmith : My follow-up question is, it looks like you've opened up an office in Amsterdam. Can you talk a little bit about the advantage that you get from that? Should -- does that mean that we should expect more international deals? Or does this allow you to source deals better throughout Europe? And are there any tax benefits from having an office there?\nSumit Roy : Yes. The reason why we needed to open an office in the Netherlands was largely driven by the structure that we have created to allow us the flexibility to continue to grow in the international markets. And by international markets, I primarily mean the UK and Western Europe. This was largely driven by a substance question around having or needing to have employees based in Amsterdam to be able to satisfy this tax structure that we've been able to create to give us this flexibility. So that's largely what's driven a couple of hires that we've made. But most of the other hires will continue to be in the UK and potentially in some of these other countries as we begin to reach a core size in terms of our portfolio. So yes, that's what really drove setting up an office in the Netherlands and hiring a few folks who can help us manage our international business. \nOperator: And our next question today comes from Harsh Hemnani with Green Street.\nHarsh Hemnani: So we've heard from some of your peers that perhaps cap rates in the U.S. are closer to topping out. Is that something during the second quarter that you're seeing too? And then the contrast that perhaps in the -- in Europe, you mentioned cap rates only started moving there in the fourth quarter or the first quarter of 2023. Do you still see more runway there and perhaps that being a tailwind for you relative to peers? And the spirit of this question is not to say that as European cap rates going to expand over the 7.6, I understand that those idiosyncratic deals might not happen every quarter, but is the trend that you're seeing in Europe upwards? And can that benefit your spread value to the peers?\nSumit Roy : Yes. Thank you for your question, Harsh. I wouldn't go so far as to say that we see cap rates moving even more in the international markets than they have here in the U.S. I mean, just look at where our 10-year bonds are the price is literally one on top of the other. So they're on those advantages today that we had a year ago. So I don't expect that to be a disproportionate movement in one geography or the other.  Could we see situations, however, unique situations that present themselves that is largely driven by used the word idiosyncratic issues? Yes. And that could garner additional cap rates. But as a market, on average, I don't see there being that much more of an advantage in one market over the other in terms of cap rates. And you're right, you said it correctly that the movement in cap rates was slower in Europe than it was here in the U.S., but I think they've largely caught up. Like some of our peers, it is fair to say that we have not seen continued expansion of cap rates vis-a-vis what we've experienced over the last, call it, 1.5 months, 2 months. But that's not to say that cap rates could not continue to move. There's just a lot of uncertainty in the market today with banks as soon as we start to believe that the banking crisis is behind us, is another name that pops up. And as you know, a lot of these regional banks were the lifeblood of providing financing to developers and to other local real estate operators. And so is it possible that those situations could again manifest itself in for sales, where we could be the beneficiary, which could then have an impact on cap rates. Yes, it's possible. That is why I hesitate to say that the movements in cap rates have played out and it's going to remain where it is today. But I think just like our peers, there has been a settling out, if you will, of cap rates that we have experienced, but I'm not sure if I subscribe to the fact that this game has played out. \nHarsh Hemnani: That's helpful color. And then you've mentioned in the past couple of calls where vacant asset sales that your income have been going up. Past couple of quarters, all asset sales were vacant. And you said this is kind of going to be the normal course of business, where if that's the best use for those assets and we have better uses for the capital to go out and buy something accretive? That's going to be what you will do. Can you give us a sense for what the buyer pool for these assets look like? Has that changed at all? The demand for these assets over the past couple of years and say versus recover?\nSumit Roy : That's a tough question, Harsh. What we are experiencing is there is a price for any asset. And if you are willing to accept the price, I think you pretty much can sell an asset. All of what we have accomplished in the first quarter were vacant sales because that's all we really needed to address. And it was about a 6% unlevered IRR, which is lower than what we have traditionally experienced, largely driven by one or two assets that we just wanted to get rid of because we felt like the long-term prospects or even the short-term prospects for that matter, didn't justify us holding on to these assets. But if you look back, it's traditionally been in that high single-digit unlevered IRR. So it gets into the double-digit levered return profile. And that's what we've traditionally experienced. And I think we should be able to go back to that. In terms of the profile of the buyers in this market, I would say most of the buyers that are interested in buying these assets are folks who want to operate out of these assets. They don't want to enter into a lease. They want to control the assets. These tend to be not institutional quality buyers, but local buyers that want to run a business out of that location and want to own the real estate to do so. That's the profile. Now in the past, we used to have, I would throw developers in the mix. And of course, developers keep sniffing around. But given that the debt markets are a little bit more challenging, there's a little less perhaps demand from that ilk of potential buyers. But I would say today, it's largely owner operators that are driving the sales process.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Greg McGinniss with Scotiabank.\nGreg McGinniss : So just touching on sale-leaseback again. I have to imagine there's more operators newly considering sale-leaseback financing. Can you just talk about the types of tenants you're having first-time conversations with, who you might be targeting? I don't know if that's cold calls or through brokers or whatever have happens to be and how you go about finding operators that maybe didn't consider sale leasebacks in the past, but would be open to it now. \nSumit Roy : Yes, it's a slew of avenues through which we source and I think it will be very consistent across the board. Obviously, we believe -- we have a curated list of folks that we've been reaching out to speaking with one of which we've already talked about, EG Group, that we didn't have expectations of sale leaseback in the near term, but it just so happened that, that became very compelling to them as a capital source. There are similar names like that. I'm not going to obviously go into the details, as you can imagine, Craig. But this is something that we do here in the U.S. We do this very consistently when we travel to the U.K. and to Western Europe. There are obviously well identified folks who own a lot of real estate who are not in the real estate business, and those are the folks that we've sort of identified and tried to reach out through. The other channels are the more traditional channels, brokers, investment bankers, colleagues who may have worked in certain places who have an in into those places. All of those are avenues that we exhaust to continue to source our transactions. And those continue to remain the avenues of sourcing.\nGreg McGinniss : Okay. And then I guess just talking about source deal volume a bit here, kind of a multi-parter. So first, when you're talking about source deal volume, does that include the deals where sellers just have unrealistic cap rate expectations? Secondly, do you have some idea or some sense of the level of sellers that maybe are just waiting on the sidelines waiting for financial markets to settle out a bit? And third, how much of the deal volume in the past, do you think it was driven by cap rates trending down, which was enhancing exit IRRs that now is probably a thing of the past.\nSumit Roy : So Greg, to answer your first question, yes, even when the cap rate expectations are unreasonable. If somebody is reaching out to us and we've sourced it as a deal, but have no interest in following up, it does get included in our source volume. I would say that a lot of folks, a lot of potential sellers of real estate are sitting on the sidelines. They recognize that the buyer pool is definitely a lot more discerning when it comes to cap rates because they are having to work in the same environment where the cost of that capital is much higher today than it was six months ago. So rather than tainting their product, they're just holding back.  And I think look, I can't prove this 100%. But if you look at our sourcing numbers, it's $16 billion, $17 billion, $18 billion. Those were the three numbers that we had the last three quarters. But it is slightly lower than the $25 billion, $26 billion that we were experiencing in the first two quarters of last year and quarters before that. So some of it is obviously getting played out in the sourcing numbers as well. It's still a very healthy sourcing number. But I think as people wait longer and longer and this turmoil continues, I think we are going to start to see some of these sellers come in and say, look, I have an event, either it be releasing refinancing scenario or what have you, that's going to push them to say, okay, we are willing to accept the fact that we need a higher cap rate. We've had a few of those occasions where 5 months ago or four months ago, we had a grocery operator that came in and they wanted a particular cap rate, and we said that was too rich for us. And we said, okay, this is where we think we could have done that deal. This was about five months ago. They've come back to us today saying, \"Can you meet that? And we said, no, we can't. Our cost of capital has moved, but we could do this. And they are willing to transact at that higher level today. So I know this is one anecdotal evidence of how it's taking time, which is why there's always a lag. But it is starting to play itself out. And I do expect sourcing numbers to start to go out. The longer this turmoil on the lending side continues, which obviously creates wonderful opportunities for us.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Eric Wolfe of Citibank. \nEric Wolfe : I wanted to follow up on what you just said a moment ago and also your comments around the new banks sort of being in the headlines every other day. Just curious whether anything that's happening right now with regional banks has already started to open up new opportunities for you. I'm specifically thinking about industries that rely on their credit. I think you mentioned some local developers. But just anything that relies on regional bank credit where you might see some opportunities today that were historically available to you?\nSumit Roy : Yes. I think, Eric, on multiple fronts, it opens up opportunities for us. Obviously, sale-leaseback as a comparative tool to raise capital, especially when compared against the debt products that's available today, it's very compelling. The cost of that capital raise is lower than what markets are able to satisfy. So I think from the traditional source, it's going to create opportunities. It's also going to create opportunities because you don't have as many lenders today who would have traditionally participated in -- on the secured side of the equation. And there are users of that capital stack that still need to either refinance their capital or just want to raise that in view of doing a sale leaseback. And because of fewer participants, I do think you can position yourself to play in that area because it's very akin to your traditional underwriting with obviously a few more nuances around how you think about debt instruments as an investment. But I think it's going to open up opportunities on that front as well. And a lot of these alternative capital asset managers and capital providers, et cetera, I think they are very well situated to take advantage of those situations as are we. \nEric Wolfe : That's helpful. And then just a question on theaters. I know small percentage for you. But I'm just curious what you think needs to happen for there to be a more liquid market for assets. And maybe for Cineworld, specifically, once their balance sheet and leases presumably restructured, do you think there will be a market to sell those assets? \nSumit Roy : I think so, Eric. Look, this is consistent with what I've been saying specifically around in a world we remain in discussions. So I'm not going to get into that. There was some news this morning, which I think is very positive for the Cineworld name, where they've actually put out a date when they're planning on emerging. They've been able to attract new capital. So I think all of that is quite positive. But what I have shared on our specific portfolio is around inbounds. There are certain locations that are absolutely in high demand for alternative uses. So in some ways, this is playing out of what is the highest and best use of some of these locations. And going through this process accelerates that ultimate outcome. And so we are -- look, we think we're going to be just fine. It is, like you said, a very small portion of our overall portfolio. To be very honest, I'm very hopeful that by the time we have our next quarterly call that this will all be behind us. And these opportunities that I've been referencing about basically repositioning some of these assets to an alternative use can start to play out, and we can actually start speaking to you about what those opportunities are. But we feel pretty good about the Cineworld situation. \nOperator: And our next question today comes from Haendel St. Juste with Mizuho.\nRavi Vaidya: This is Ravi Vaidya on the line for Haendel St. Juste. Last quarter, you commented that your watch list is about of 4% of total ABR. Just wondering what that is right now? And what other categories outside of the theaters are you monitoring or have a negative view on .\nSumit Roy : Yes. Good question. Our watch list today is right around 4.4%. As you correctly pointed out, it is largely dominated by the theater industry. Some of the other areas that we are continuing to look at. And keep in mind that our watch list is not always a credit issue. It is just our view on the real estate, the location of that real estate and what the ultimate outcome is going to look like. So it's a combination of credit. It's a combination of real estate underwriting. But ultimately, the watch list is dictated by the long-term desirability of those locations and operators. So along with the theaters, I would say, restaurants are in the some of the more discretionary type concepts out there like home furnishing. There are very few day care centers and some of the other businesses that are not very well capitalized that you'll find there. But that's the mists of what you will find on the on the watch list.\nRavi Vaidya : That's helpful. One more here. One of your peers sold movie theaters at [7.8], regarding your -- would you consider selling theaters in that range? Or what other -- what are your conversations been like in terms of pricing and regarding the theaters, as you said it was such a large component of the watch list?\nSumit Roy : Yes. That's actually a very good pricing. And I suspect that the person that bought it is probably a developer. And we've done our own analysis. And for us, we feel like the best way to create value would be to hold on to these assets and then especially the ones where we have a view that can be redeveloped et cetera, and capture that view once we have full control of that asset. We truly told there is so much discussion that we are having with Cineworld at this point that I don't want to get into the details, but that discussion needs to be behind us. And my understanding is that a lot of these assets that are now going to be put out there for sale, et cetera, have already had their rents renegotiated, everything has already been priced in. And those cap rates that are being shared are being shared off of those new adjusted rent numbers. And in our view, if we feel like, hey, let's just hold on to these assets, we'd much rather get these assets back and reposition it perhaps with some additional capital, but create much more value for our investors, then that's what we choose to do. And we haven't engaged in trying to go out and try to find the market we've had a lot of unsolicited calls. I can tell you that, but we really haven't engaged in trying to sell any of our theater assets. We want to resolve the Cineworld situation. And I think with the news today, I think that date is certainly getting closer before we start to figure out what the best economic outcome is.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley.\nRonald Kamdem : A couple of quick ones. Just going back to the opening comments on the international portfolio at 11.7%. Just thinking about where could that number go? Obviously, there's different tax it so forth. But in your mind, how can that number trend in the next couple of years, obviously, opportunity driven.\nSumit Roy : Well, these last couple of quarters, they have still represented 20%, 25% of our transaction volume. So clearly, that over time should continue to drift up. It was drifting up at a much higher clip when we were doing a lot more transactions. And I do expect for us to get back into that more normalized 30%, 35%, maybe even more if certain situations play out. So I'm hopeful to keep growing our pie. Look, we continue to look at new geographies, and especially at a time like this, new geographies that seemed a bit out of our reach are starting to become a little bit more within our reach and more compelling today. So as we keep adding new geographies, as we continue to enhance our relationships, et cetera, I see this number 11% continue to grow and be a bigger part of the overall portfolio.\nRonald Kamdem : Great. And then if I could just touch on sort of two verticals: one, consumer-centric medical to gaming, which I don't think has been mentioned before, but just a quick update on what the opportunity set is looking like? Has it slowed down with the events over the past couple of weeks and so forth? And how are you guys thinking about those?\nSumit Roy : So gaming continues to be of tremendous interest to us, Ron. It's just hard to replicate what we got with the Boston asset. And we have an amazing partner in Craig at Wynn, and we will continue to try to work on trying to find new transactions that I don't know if we'll ever be able to replicate the one in Boston, but of a similar type of a similar dominance in particular markets. So we are looking at transactions. We are looking at transactions every day. And the pricing expectations is perhaps something that we are still trying to work through. And if we can get to and understanding which works for parties involved, I think, and I hope we are able to grow that part of our business, but it's not a fait accompli. I mean it is -- the bar for us is higher. But the good news is there is a product out there that meets that bar. So we are very hopeful. With consumer-centric, we -- that's a business we love. We've been in that business. We've just coined the phrase to sort of define an area of our portfolio that we've obviously been very interested in. And with the dental transaction that we did in the fourth quarter of last year, that helped accelerate that part of the business. Look -- and I don't want to get into the thesis again. I think we've shared that already for a variety of reasons, we like that business. And I think in some ways, this is a business that is getting defined right in front of our eyes, and we want to participate in the potential upside that I see on the real estate side. And so again, partnering with the right operators, forward-thinking operators who share a similar philosophy of delivery of health care, I think will, I hope, result in a slew of transactions for us on the consumer-centric side. So both those areas remain of high interest to us, Ron.\nOperator: And our next question comes from John Massoca with Ladenburg Thalmann.\nJohn Massocca : Both on the our market here. So I just have one question. Obviously, there was a same-store decline in [indiscernible], which was kind of explained, but there was also a same-store decline in your QSR portfolio. I'm just kind of wondering what was driving that. Is that some of the credit issues certain franchise operators had earlier this year or something else that's kind of idiosyncratic? \nSumit Roy : No, no. It's -- look, the overall same-store decline was largely a function of what Christie touched on to explain why our AFFO per share was flat. It was basically -- if you look at the reversals we took in the first quarter of '22 versus the reversals that we took in 2023 first quarter, there was a net $9 million reversal that was very positive in the first quarter of 2022 that we didn't have we had to compare against in this quarter. And when you look at same-store calculation, obviously, that's what drove that very benign same-store growth number. Absent that, if you were looking at just the core portfolio, our growth would have been 1.5%. The specifics around QSR is more driven by a couple of concepts that are not doing very well. Boston market continues to be in the news. It's a very small portion of our overall allocation, I think, basis points at this point. But that is what drags the same-store sales numbers same-store growth numbers for that particular industry. So it's very specific to a couple of names. But overall, like I said, we were around at 1.5%, had it not been for these reversals in the first quarter of last year. .\nJohn Massocca : Okay. And maybe what's the overall view on kind of the franchise restaurant base that kind of rough turn of the year, but have things stabilized at all given kind of the continued strength of the consumer? Or just kind of when you talk to tenants when you look at new deals, what's the outlook there for that specific tenant industry? .\nSumit Roy : Yes. It's what you would expect, John, Casual dining is depending on the concepts, some concepts continue to post very good results. Like Outback, I saw the results not too long ago. They had positive same-store growth. I think Chile has had a similar story. But then you look at other concepts, they're not doing as well. Thankfully, the two that I mentioned are our two largest exposures. But we do have some smaller concepts. And it's a smaller concept that if they don't have the balance sheet wherewithal to increase prices or pass through some of the costs, et cetera. they're going to struggle. And again, it's not -- none of this is a big part of our portfolio and all of which there are areas that we are focused on. It's already part of our watch list. But that's where I expect to see some level of disruption, but nothing new is expected based on what we see today. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies.\nLinda Tsai : Just a quick one. Just a broader question on the overall market. When you look at the amount of dry powder available on the sidelines to deploy towards net lease, which industries are you seeing the most demand?\nSumit Roy : That's an interesting one, Linda. If we just look at it and I look back, I think it's convenience stores and grocery. Those are the industries that we we're able to do the most deals in and -- but that's a selective selection bias that we have. Those are the industries we like. And so I can't answer that across the board. But what I will tell you is, yes, you're right, there's a lot of capital, but that cost of capital is not uniform. That's one of our biggest advantages that we have a cost of capital that continues to be incredibly competitive and lower than almost everyone. So in some ways, we find ourselves in a very favorable position to take advantage of what we are seeing in the market. But we are very focused on areas of interest to us.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn it back over to the management team for any closing remarks.\nSumit Roy : Thank you all for your attendance today. We look forward to meeting with many of you at the upcoming NAREIT conference in June. Thank you. .\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Christie Kelly",
            "content": "Thank you, Sumit. We work together with our clients and our One Team to achieve a successful quarter on a number of fronts, delivering AFFO per share of $0.98 on behalf of all of our stakeholders. We would highlight that the comparable quarter in 2022 benefited from approximately $10.2 million of rental revenue reserve reversals, resulting in an AFFO per share growth headwind of approximately $0.015 per share in the first quarter of 2023.  In addition, higher year-over-year short-term interest rates represented an approximate $0.02 growth headwind as our weighted average interest rate on revolver and commercial paper borrowings was approximately 300 basis points higher than it was in the comparative period in 2022 on a similar average borrowing base. Excluding these two items, our year-over-year AFFO per share growth rate was approximately 3.5% this quarter. As we evaluate the core fundamentals of our business, we remain focused upon delivering for our stakeholders over the long term and are encouraged by opportunities ahead.  To that end, we are increasing the low end of our AFFO per share guidance range by $0.01 resulting in a new range of $3.94 to $4.03, which represents 1.7% annual growth at the midpoint of the updated range. It has been a busy and productive start to the year on the capital raising front. Despite continued market volatility, we have raised approximately $3.9 billion of capital this year excluding $1.5 billion of unsettled forward equity. In April, we closed a $1 billion bond offering, which was comprised of $400 million of 4.7% senior unsecured notes due in 2028 and $600 million of 4.9% senior unsecured notes due in 2033, resulted in a weighted average tenure of eight years and semi-annual yield to maturity of 5.05%. The issuance allowed us to satisfy our near-term debt issuance needs while reducing our exposure to variable rate revolver and commercial paper borrowings and to almost zero after our transaction closed on April 14.  In March, we increased our dividend for the 120th time since our public listing in 1994, to an annual rate of $3.06 per share, representing 3.2% growth from the prior year period. Providing a stable and growing dividend is core to our mission at Realty Income, and we take great pride in being one of only 66 constituents in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index for having raised our dividend every year for the last 25 consecutive years. I would like to thank our One Team whose focus and diligence has paved the way for our continued growth as we build upon our track record of consistency.  And with that, I would like to turn it back over to Sumit. Absolutely, Brad. I think first, in terms of what Sumit had discussed and the increase of our acquisitions guidance to over $6 billion, we remain conservative in that front and really looking towards the second half of the year, while things remain strong. As Sumit has discussed, we're really wait and see here as things unfold. I think the other thing, too, in terms of guidance that we've articulated, and I mentioned some of this in my prepared remarks, is really the headwinds that we're seeing from a debt perspective, although we've been very focused on ensuring that we're derisking our balance sheet, and you can see that in the transactions that we've executed through April. We're really looking at where that may unfold in terms of the second half of the year and don't believe that, that will alleviate over and above the competitive cost of capital that we've been able to generate vis-a-vis last year. And I think finally, in terms of the positive trends that you saw in terms of the tightening of the guidance with G&A, we remain particularly disciplined during this macroeconomic backdrop, and are focused on managing our G&A. But further to that, it's the benefits of size and scale. And you can see that over the years in terms of the trends of G&A to revenues. And then finally, from an unreimbursed property expense margin perspective and the tightening there, we're just following in on the positive trends that we've been able to execute upon."

            "content": "Thank you, Andrea. Welcome, everyone. We are pleased to report solid 2023 first quarter results, exhibiting continued momentum in our business. I would like to express my utmost gratitude to our One Team whose efforts enabled us to continue delivering on our growth objectives. I would also like to thank our equity and fixed income investors for their continued vote of confidence.  Our team's efforts and the benefits of our size and scale were reflected in our first quarter results, highlighted by approximately $1.7 billion of high-quality investments acquired at a cash cap rate of 7%. This represents a 90 basis point increase compared to the investment cash cap rate we achieved in the fourth quarter of last year and resulted in an investment spread of 163 basis points, which is above our historical averages. As we have experienced in prior cycles, cap rates for our investments after an adjustment period have historically tended to be positively correlated with interest rates, which is a trend we have largely continued to experience this year after the recent rise in rates. Our ability to access well-priced capital has historically served as a competitive advantage and is a testament to our long history of maintaining a conservative balance sheet and a diversified real estate portfolio, supported by clients who are leaders in their respective industries. Amidst an environment in which capital is expensive and are scarce for many of our clients, our value proposition is even more pronounced. This dynamic is reflected in the recent portfolio acquisitions we have announced, the active deal pipeline we see today and the favorable pricing spread we see for large portfolio transactions vis-a-vis one-off single asset transactions. Our differentiated platform extends beyond the external growth lens. Recently, we have taken steps to leverage the size of our portfolio and the history of our operating business through the continued development of advanced analytics. The objective of this initiative is to develop predictive and prescriptive insights that harness the collective proprietary data that we've accumulated over several decades of investing in managing and releasing single-tenant net lease properties. Our team's proprietary predictive analytic tool leverages the strove of information in our investment underwriting, portfolio management, asset management and development efforts enabling even more informed investment decisions made by our best-in-class One Team members.  As our business grows, so too will the predictive power of this tool, which we believe will generate significant value for our stakeholders as we refine the accuracy, test conclusions and broaden scope across industries, property types and geographies. As part of our core investment thesis, our size and scale have created opportunities to serve as a capital provider for best-in-class partners looking for alternative means of financing given elevated debt costs.  In the first quarter, we agreed to acquire up to 415 high-quality convenience stores from EG Group for $1.5 billion. Over 80% of the total portfolio annualized contractual rent is expected to be generated from properties under the Cumberland Farms brand, and we expect to close on this transaction in the second quarter. As illustrated by this deal, we believe our ability to offer not only certainty of close, but also attractively priced capital as a one-stop solution for sale-leaseback transactions is particularly valuable to institutional sellers of real estate today. We believe this will continue to expand our competitive advantage. Internationally, we continue to venture into new geographical verticals and grow the total addressable market opportunity. This quarter, we took advantage of favorable pricing internationally to acquire properties worth approximately $390 million at an initial cash lease yield of 7.6%. After our initial entry into international markets in 2019, we now derive 11.7% of total portfolio annualized contractual rent from those markets. This natural extension of our platform has been a pillar of growth for the last four years and is indicative of our ability to methodically establish and scale a new vertical.  Given the continued momentum in our acquisitions pipeline and our progress to date, we are increasing our 2023 investment guidance to over $6 billion from our prior guidance of over $5 billion. Consistent with our investment strategy, we remain disciplined with regard to our balance sheet. Subsequent to our April bond offering, which settled on April 14 and we held approximately $5.6 billion of liquidity, including unsettled forward equity totaling $1.5 billion. As a result, our current financial position has afforded us the ability to lean into near-term investment opportunities.  Moving to operations. Our platform continues to generate durable cash flows, which support our stable earnings profile. For the first quarter, we are pleased to report occupancy of 99%, matching last quarter for the highest rate at the end of a reporting period in over 20 years. Additionally, we generated a 101.7% recapture rate across 176 renewed or new leases executed during the quarter. These results are a reflection of our talented asset management team and our unwavering commitment to core capital allocation principles, which include a focus on industry-leading clients who often operate in a low price point service-based or nondiscretionary industries. Our purposeful diversification across industries, geographies and clients and our emphasis on high-quality real estate locations and rigorous credit underwriting. Our investment philosophy is nuanced and not simply predicated upon the pursuit of investment-grade clients, which ended the first quarter at 40.8% of our annualized contractual rent. Many of our strongest operators, such as Sainsbury's have no public debt and thus are not rated at all. However, the consistency of their operations and health of their balance sheet are favorable attributes that are consistent with those of an investment-grade rated company. We estimate that approximately 5.3% of our annualized contractual rent comes from unrated operators without public debt. We remain committed to investments that offer us attractive risk-adjusted returns as evidenced throughout our history. And going forward, where we believe, based upon our disciplined underwriting and analytics, we are achieving better returns per unit of incremental risk.  I would like to briefly touch on Cineworld which represents 1.3% of our annualized contractual rent. Despite the ongoing Chapter 11 bankruptcy, we have continued to receive 100% of contractual rent in the first quarter and through April. As of March 31, 2023, we had cumulative reserves of $33 million on our Cineworld properties. Outstanding receivables net of reserves and excluding straight-line receivables were $14.1 million. We remain in discussions with this client and we'll update the market on the outcome of these discussions at the appropriate time.  Before turning the call over to Christie, I would like to highlight that in March, we published our third annual sustainability report which details our ongoing commitment to operating as a responsible corporate citizen for our stockholders, our team, the communities in which we operate and the environment. I'm proud of our continued progress on ESG initiatives as we seek to fulfill our commitment to building sustainable relationships and I strongly encourage all of today's listeners to navigate to the Sustainability page of our website to review the report. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Christie. Thank you, Christi. In conclusion, during periods of market uncertainty or dislocation we look to unearth value by leveraging the inherent advantages of our platform. These trends include our continued access to relatively attractively priced capital and our portfolio scale, which we seek to leverage to produce unique investment opportunities as a leading sale-leaseback capital provider. When combined with the collective talents of our best-in-class team members to source, underwrite and close on creative acquisition opportunities with strong risk-adjusted returns, we believe we are very well positioned to continue amplifying our competitive advantages on behalf of our clients and stakeholders. We thank all our stakeholders for their support, loyalty and trust in our company.  And with that, we can open it up for questions. Yes. Thank you for your questions, Nate. Good questions. Let's start with the sourcing numbers. For this quarter, we sourced about $16 billion worth of product, 25% of which was in the international markets. I would say that if you go back to when we started going into the international markets, the composition of international versus U.S. has been roughly around 30%, 70% in that ZIP code, plus/minus 5%. So this is pretty much within that particular range.  What you might have noticed, however, is the amount of closing more recently, both in the fourth quarter of last year, the first quarter of this year. The contribution from the international side has been a little bit lower than what you have traditionally seen. I would say that the international business has contributed about 35% of volume in terms of what we end up closing versus closer to 20%, 22% this particular quarter. And the main reason for that is we saw a delay in adjustments on the cap rate side in the international markets vis-a-vis the U.S. markets. We started to see cap rate expansion in the U.S. towards the end of -- middle of third quarter, fourth quarter and obviously through the first quarter of this year. But we didn't quite have the same experience in the UK market and some of the other international markets, till, I would say, towards the end of the fourth quarter. And what was largely making potential sellers reconsider the market was not so much driven by actual trades taking place, but more idiosyncratic to their particular needs. Around redemption issues or refinancings that were coming near term. And that's largely what's driven these opportunistic transactions that we've gotten over the finish line in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of last -- this year. And that's what's resulted in cap rates being substantially higher than what I would call the norm or what we are seeing in the everyday market in some of these international markets.  So that explains the 60 basis point higher cap rate that we were able to achieve. And I might add, this is excellent product largely driven by idiosyncratic issues being experienced by buyers who wanted to get this off their books to meet some of the things that I've just discussed. So that's the dynamic we've seen... Yes. And Nate, you've hit the nail on the head. It's exactly that. As you know, development obligations have a much longer lead time. So a lot of what you see in -- you saw in the fourth quarter, third quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year, though it's starting to move up, it hasn't moved quite as quickly, largely because what you're seeing filtered through the investment numbers, but transactions that we hit struck, I would say, three quarters ago or four quarters ago. But you should expect to see the yield on development creep closer to what we are actually experiencing in the traditional acquisitions market over the next couple of quarters. So it's just a timing issue. No, no, Brad. I wouldn't go so far as to say it's timed out. In fact, the momentum has continued, and we expect that momentum to remain strong. I don't know how many billion-plus deals, but these large transactions what drives some of the near-term financing issues that a lot of companies are going to have to deal with. And with what we are seeing play out in the banking sector with fewer banks out there to provide capital, the cost of that capital being what it is, given the interest rate environment, I do believe that sale leaseback will continue to be a very attractive alternative to raise capital to help address financing needs at these companies. Keep in mind, EG had never done a sale leaseback. They had that option for many, many years. And they chose to go down this path largely to address some of the leverage concerns that they had on the balance sheet. And we expect that trend to continue. So -- and that's the reason why that's the impetus behind why we felt we should increase our acquisition guidance by $1 billion. Thanks for the question, Josh. So EG is obviously a very well-established name in the U.K. market. Neil and I had been calling on them for a while, along with TDR Capital, they're capital providers for a while. And this is a relationship. We knew they didn't have a high level of interest in necessarily going down the path of sale leaseback when we first started to have conversations with them. But I think that, that relationship ultimately played out to our benefit when we were awarded the deal when they did choose to go down the path of sale leaseback to help meet some of their capital needs shorter term. This was a competitive process. It was run by Eastdil. We went through. We were obviously in close contact with EG directly as well. And there were three finalists, and we felt like we were awarded the deal based on our reputation, surety of close and the fact that we had spent time developing a relationship with them. So that's what really got us the deal at the end. And our ability to be creative and there were certain asks that they had and our ability to meet those certain asks also, I believe, accrue to our favor. So I think all of those factors went towards us being awarded the transaction despite us not being the highest bidder. Yes. Josh, that's a very good question. I'm actually going to go back to the EG Group conversation we just had. If you look at the actual portfolio, 80% of the portfolio is Cumberland Farms. And I just want to remind the group that three years ago, when Cumberland Farms was available for sale, they were all of the natural operators that were very, very interested in this very well-run private company. And what was being bandied about as a potential sale leaseback, the pricing was in the low 5s, high 4 ZIP code. And it ended up being EG Group that won the transaction, and they obviously didn't want any sale-leaseback financing to effectuate the buyout. But that was the quality of the real estate. That Cumberland Farms was demanding at that particular time. Fast forward today, the four-wall coverages on these assets have only improved and improved, I would say, dramatically. So the assets remain exactly the same assets, and we were able to accomplish this transaction at 6.9%.  Yes, if you look at EG Group, the credit that's operating these assets, they are sub-investment grade. But if you look at the quality of the assets, it's exactly the same. And we believe that EG Group is a very good operator of convenience store business. We can see that in the history that they have established in the UK, and we certainly see it in the performance of these assets. When you compare it to where they were performing three years ago and was warranting a price in the low 5s, high 4s to where we were able to accomplish. So now you fast forward and you say, okay, you're getting 150 basis points, 160 basis points of additional spread on this real estate, are you being paid for the credit risk inherent in the operator? And that's where the concept of risk-adjusted returns comes into play for us, and it is so front and center in everything we do. The answer for us was a resounding, yes. We are being compensated. And so for us, we've said this before that investment grade rating is a byproduct of the actual underwriting. It is not something that we seek out. It gets taken into consideration on the collectibility of the rent flow over the 20-year or 25-year leases that we underwrite to. But ultimately, we look at every transaction on a risk-adjusted basis. And if it makes sense, despite the fact that it may or may not have investment-grade rating is something that we are going to continue to pursue. Yes. That's a great question, Michael. Things are moving so fast. Every other day, there's a bank in the news. News is super fast. And so how do we think about our business and why do I use phrases like continued momentum. Even though this may be a lagging indicator, we are looking at transactions, these renewals every day. And when we are seeing the fact that we can still continue to generate 102%, 103% re-leasing spreads, yes, it's lagging, but literally weeks, months. And it gives me continued hope that, look, for our product, where we play in the market, et cetera, there continues to be a fair amount of demand. And it manifests itself in some of the positive re-leasing spreads that we share with the market. The second piece, which is much more of a forward-looking statement is what are the continued discussions that we are having that then helps drive our pipeline on the investment side. What are the kinds of discussions that we are having? What's the size of the discussions that we're having, what's the yield associated with those discussions. I think all of that gives us confidence that there continues to be momentum. The fact that we were able to raise $3.1 billion within a period of three months, in the fixed income market, the fact that we were able to close on $800 million of equity and have $1.5 million of unsettled equity available -- $1 billion, sorry, of unsettled equity, again continues to give me confidence that even on our capital side, for us, we continue to sit in a very favorable position. So we have the opportunity. We have the ability to raise capital. We have the ability to make spreads north of what we have historically achieved. And now with the international markets starting to reflect a little bit more of a positive movement for us on the cap rate side. That's what gives me confidence to say that we have continued momentum in the business. Yes. The reason why we needed to open an office in the Netherlands was largely driven by the structure that we have created to allow us the flexibility to continue to grow in the international markets. And by international markets, I primarily mean the UK and Western Europe. This was largely driven by a substance question around having or needing to have employees based in Amsterdam to be able to satisfy this tax structure that we've been able to create to give us this flexibility. So that's largely what's driven a couple of hires that we've made. But most of the other hires will continue to be in the UK and potentially in some of these other countries as we begin to reach a core size in terms of our portfolio. So yes, that's what really drove setting up an office in the Netherlands and hiring a few folks who can help us manage our international business. Yes. Thank you for your question, Harsh. I wouldn't go so far as to say that we see cap rates moving even more in the international markets than they have here in the U.S. I mean, just look at where our 10-year bonds are the price is literally one on top of the other. So they're on those advantages today that we had a year ago. So I don't expect that to be a disproportionate movement in one geography or the other.  Could we see situations, however, unique situations that present themselves that is largely driven by used the word idiosyncratic issues? Yes. And that could garner additional cap rates. But as a market, on average, I don't see there being that much more of an advantage in one market over the other in terms of cap rates. And you're right, you said it correctly that the movement in cap rates was slower in Europe than it was here in the U.S., but I think they've largely caught up. Like some of our peers, it is fair to say that we have not seen continued expansion of cap rates vis-a-vis what we've experienced over the last, call it, 1.5 months, 2 months. But that's not to say that cap rates could not continue to move. There's just a lot of uncertainty in the market today with banks as soon as we start to believe that the banking crisis is behind us, is another name that pops up. And as you know, a lot of these regional banks were the lifeblood of providing financing to developers and to other local real estate operators. And so is it possible that those situations could again manifest itself in for sales, where we could be the beneficiary, which could then have an impact on cap rates. Yes, it's possible. That is why I hesitate to say that the movements in cap rates have played out and it's going to remain where it is today. But I think just like our peers, there has been a settling out, if you will, of cap rates that we have experienced, but I'm not sure if I subscribe to the fact that this game has played out. That's a tough question, Harsh. What we are experiencing is there is a price for any asset. And if you are willing to accept the price, I think you pretty much can sell an asset. All of what we have accomplished in the first quarter were vacant sales because that's all we really needed to address. And it was about a 6% unlevered IRR, which is lower than what we have traditionally experienced, largely driven by one or two assets that we just wanted to get rid of because we felt like the long-term prospects or even the short-term prospects for that matter, didn't justify us holding on to these assets. But if you look back, it's traditionally been in that high single-digit unlevered IRR. So it gets into the double-digit levered return profile. And that's what we've traditionally experienced. And I think we should be able to go back to that. In terms of the profile of the buyers in this market, I would say most of the buyers that are interested in buying these assets are folks who want to operate out of these assets. They don't want to enter into a lease. They want to control the assets. These tend to be not institutional quality buyers, but local buyers that want to run a business out of that location and want to own the real estate to do so. That's the profile. Now in the past, we used to have, I would throw developers in the mix. And of course, developers keep sniffing around. But given that the debt markets are a little bit more challenging, there's a little less perhaps demand from that ilk of potential buyers. But I would say today, it's largely owner operators that are driving the sales process. Yes, it's a slew of avenues through which we source and I think it will be very consistent across the board. Obviously, we believe -- we have a curated list of folks that we've been reaching out to speaking with one of which we've already talked about, EG Group, that we didn't have expectations of sale leaseback in the near term, but it just so happened that, that became very compelling to them as a capital source. There are similar names like that. I'm not going to obviously go into the details, as you can imagine, Craig. But this is something that we do here in the U.S. We do this very consistently when we travel to the U.K. and to Western Europe. There are obviously well identified folks who own a lot of real estate who are not in the real estate business, and those are the folks that we've sort of identified and tried to reach out through. The other channels are the more traditional channels, brokers, investment bankers, colleagues who may have worked in certain places who have an in into those places. All of those are avenues that we exhaust to continue to source our transactions. And those continue to remain the avenues of sourcing. So Greg, to answer your first question, yes, even when the cap rate expectations are unreasonable. If somebody is reaching out to us and we've sourced it as a deal, but have no interest in following up, it does get included in our source volume. I would say that a lot of folks, a lot of potential sellers of real estate are sitting on the sidelines. They recognize that the buyer pool is definitely a lot more discerning when it comes to cap rates because they are having to work in the same environment where the cost of that capital is much higher today than it was six months ago. So rather than tainting their product, they're just holding back.  And I think look, I can't prove this 100%. But if you look at our sourcing numbers, it's $16 billion, $17 billion, $18 billion. Those were the three numbers that we had the last three quarters. But it is slightly lower than the $25 billion, $26 billion that we were experiencing in the first two quarters of last year and quarters before that. So some of it is obviously getting played out in the sourcing numbers as well. It's still a very healthy sourcing number. But I think as people wait longer and longer and this turmoil continues, I think we are going to start to see some of these sellers come in and say, look, I have an event, either it be releasing refinancing scenario or what have you, that's going to push them to say, okay, we are willing to accept the fact that we need a higher cap rate. We've had a few of those occasions where 5 months ago or four months ago, we had a grocery operator that came in and they wanted a particular cap rate, and we said that was too rich for us. And we said, okay, this is where we think we could have done that deal. This was about five months ago. They've come back to us today saying, \"Can you meet that? And we said, no, we can't. Our cost of capital has moved, but we could do this. And they are willing to transact at that higher level today. So I know this is one anecdotal evidence of how it's taking time, which is why there's always a lag. But it is starting to play itself out. And I do expect sourcing numbers to start to go out. The longer this turmoil on the lending side continues, which obviously creates wonderful opportunities for us. Yes. I think, Eric, on multiple fronts, it opens up opportunities for us. Obviously, sale-leaseback as a comparative tool to raise capital, especially when compared against the debt products that's available today, it's very compelling. The cost of that capital raise is lower than what markets are able to satisfy. So I think from the traditional source, it's going to create opportunities. It's also going to create opportunities because you don't have as many lenders today who would have traditionally participated in -- on the secured side of the equation. And there are users of that capital stack that still need to either refinance their capital or just want to raise that in view of doing a sale leaseback. And because of fewer participants, I do think you can position yourself to play in that area because it's very akin to your traditional underwriting with obviously a few more nuances around how you think about debt instruments as an investment. But I think it's going to open up opportunities on that front as well. And a lot of these alternative capital asset managers and capital providers, et cetera, I think they are very well situated to take advantage of those situations as are we. I think so, Eric. Look, this is consistent with what I've been saying specifically around in a world we remain in discussions. So I'm not going to get into that. There was some news this morning, which I think is very positive for the Cineworld name, where they've actually put out a date when they're planning on emerging. They've been able to attract new capital. So I think all of that is quite positive. But what I have shared on our specific portfolio is around inbounds. There are certain locations that are absolutely in high demand for alternative uses. So in some ways, this is playing out of what is the highest and best use of some of these locations. And going through this process accelerates that ultimate outcome. And so we are -- look, we think we're going to be just fine. It is, like you said, a very small portion of our overall portfolio. To be very honest, I'm very hopeful that by the time we have our next quarterly call that this will all be behind us. And these opportunities that I've been referencing about basically repositioning some of these assets to an alternative use can start to play out, and we can actually start speaking to you about what those opportunities are. But we feel pretty good about the Cineworld situation. Yes. Good question. Our watch list today is right around 4.4%. As you correctly pointed out, it is largely dominated by the theater industry. Some of the other areas that we are continuing to look at. And keep in mind that our watch list is not always a credit issue. It is just our view on the real estate, the location of that real estate and what the ultimate outcome is going to look like. So it's a combination of credit. It's a combination of real estate underwriting. But ultimately, the watch list is dictated by the long-term desirability of those locations and operators. So along with the theaters, I would say, restaurants are in the some of the more discretionary type concepts out there like home furnishing. There are very few day care centers and some of the other businesses that are not very well capitalized that you'll find there. But that's the mists of what you will find on the on the watch list. Yes. That's actually a very good pricing. And I suspect that the person that bought it is probably a developer. And we've done our own analysis. And for us, we feel like the best way to create value would be to hold on to these assets and then especially the ones where we have a view that can be redeveloped et cetera, and capture that view once we have full control of that asset. We truly told there is so much discussion that we are having with Cineworld at this point that I don't want to get into the details, but that discussion needs to be behind us. And my understanding is that a lot of these assets that are now going to be put out there for sale, et cetera, have already had their rents renegotiated, everything has already been priced in. And those cap rates that are being shared are being shared off of those new adjusted rent numbers. And in our view, if we feel like, hey, let's just hold on to these assets, we'd much rather get these assets back and reposition it perhaps with some additional capital, but create much more value for our investors, then that's what we choose to do. And we haven't engaged in trying to go out and try to find the market we've had a lot of unsolicited calls. I can tell you that, but we really haven't engaged in trying to sell any of our theater assets. We want to resolve the Cineworld situation. And I think with the news today, I think that date is certainly getting closer before we start to figure out what the best economic outcome is. Well, these last couple of quarters, they have still represented 20%, 25% of our transaction volume. So clearly, that over time should continue to drift up. It was drifting up at a much higher clip when we were doing a lot more transactions. And I do expect for us to get back into that more normalized 30%, 35%, maybe even more if certain situations play out. So I'm hopeful to keep growing our pie. Look, we continue to look at new geographies, and especially at a time like this, new geographies that seemed a bit out of our reach are starting to become a little bit more within our reach and more compelling today. So as we keep adding new geographies, as we continue to enhance our relationships, et cetera, I see this number 11% continue to grow and be a bigger part of the overall portfolio. So gaming continues to be of tremendous interest to us, Ron. It's just hard to replicate what we got with the Boston asset. And we have an amazing partner in Craig at Wynn, and we will continue to try to work on trying to find new transactions that I don't know if we'll ever be able to replicate the one in Boston, but of a similar type of a similar dominance in particular markets. So we are looking at transactions. We are looking at transactions every day. And the pricing expectations is perhaps something that we are still trying to work through. And if we can get to and understanding which works for parties involved, I think, and I hope we are able to grow that part of our business, but it's not a fait accompli. I mean it is -- the bar for us is higher. But the good news is there is a product out there that meets that bar. So we are very hopeful. With consumer-centric, we -- that's a business we love. We've been in that business. We've just coined the phrase to sort of define an area of our portfolio that we've obviously been very interested in. And with the dental transaction that we did in the fourth quarter of last year, that helped accelerate that part of the business. Look -- and I don't want to get into the thesis again. I think we've shared that already for a variety of reasons, we like that business. And I think in some ways, this is a business that is getting defined right in front of our eyes, and we want to participate in the potential upside that I see on the real estate side. And so again, partnering with the right operators, forward-thinking operators who share a similar philosophy of delivery of health care, I think will, I hope, result in a slew of transactions for us on the consumer-centric side. So both those areas remain of high interest to us, Ron. No, no. It's -- look, the overall same-store decline was largely a function of what Christie touched on to explain why our AFFO per share was flat. It was basically -- if you look at the reversals we took in the first quarter of '22 versus the reversals that we took in 2023 first quarter, there was a net $9 million reversal that was very positive in the first quarter of 2022 that we didn't have we had to compare against in this quarter. And when you look at same-store calculation, obviously, that's what drove that very benign same-store growth number. Absent that, if you were looking at just the core portfolio, our growth would have been 1.5%. The specifics around QSR is more driven by a couple of concepts that are not doing very well. Boston market continues to be in the news. It's a very small portion of our overall allocation, I think, basis points at this point. But that is what drags the same-store sales numbers same-store growth numbers for that particular industry. So it's very specific to a couple of names. But overall, like I said, we were around at 1.5%, had it not been for these reversals in the first quarter of last year. . Yes. It's what you would expect, John, Casual dining is depending on the concepts, some concepts continue to post very good results. Like Outback, I saw the results not too long ago. They had positive same-store growth. I think Chile has had a similar story. But then you look at other concepts, they're not doing as well. Thankfully, the two that I mentioned are our two largest exposures. But we do have some smaller concepts. And it's a smaller concept that if they don't have the balance sheet wherewithal to increase prices or pass through some of the costs, et cetera. they're going to struggle. And again, it's not -- none of this is a big part of our portfolio and all of which there are areas that we are focused on. It's already part of our watch list. But that's where I expect to see some level of disruption, but nothing new is expected based on what we see today. That's an interesting one, Linda. If we just look at it and I look back, I think it's convenience stores and grocery. Those are the industries that we we're able to do the most deals in and -- but that's a selective selection bias that we have. Those are the industries we like. And so I can't answer that across the board. But what I will tell you is, yes, you're right, there's a lot of capital, but that cost of capital is not uniform. That's one of our biggest advantages that we have a cost of capital that continues to be incredibly competitive and lower than almost everyone. So in some ways, we find ourselves in a very favorable position to take advantage of what we are seeing in the market. But we are very focused on areas of interest to us. Thank you all for your attendance today. We look forward to meeting with many of you at the upcoming NAREIT conference in June. Thank you. ."

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kelsey Mueller, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nKelsey Mueller: Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's third quarter operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jonathan Pong, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. During this conference call, we will make statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. The Company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. We will disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the Company's Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two-question limit during the Q&A portion of the call, in order to give everyone, the opportunity to participate. If you would like to ask additional questions, you may reenter the queue. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy.\nSumit Roy: Thank you, Kelsy. Welcome, everyone. Realty Income's third quarter results highlight our continued momentum, disciplined execution and the benefits of our global investment and operating platform. Our value proposition to investors is simple, a real estate partner to the world's leading companies. We've created a defensive and diversified real estate portfolio consisting of top-tier clients to drive stable and predictable cash flow. As a result, we've delivered positive total operational returns each year since becoming a public company 30 years ago, successfully navigating a variety of economic environments. Importantly, as we move through an improving external backdrop helped by a recent rate cut in the U.S., we've started to see a more attractive transaction landscape. Given this, we are pleased to increase our 2024 investment volume guidance to approximately $3.5 billion, underpinned by strong investment activity year-to-date as well as a robust pipeline for the fourth quarter. Concurrently, we are raising the low end of our AFFO per share guidance for the year to a range of $4.17 to $4.21. Despite some recent volatility driven by exogenous factors, we remain confident in our strategic vision and the opportunity ahead. Our investment strategy offers significant opportunities for growth across multiple verticals, including our core of retail and industrial and newer verticals such as data centers and gaming. At the same time, we are making progress towards the establishment of a private capital fund, which I'll touch on later in this call. Turning to the details of the third quarter. We delivered AFFO per share of $1.05, representing a 2.9% growth compared to last year. We invested $740 million into high-quality opportunities at a blended 7.4% initial cash yield or a 7.8% straight-line yield assuming CPI growth of 2%. Of this, $378 million of volume was invested in the U.S. at a 7.4% initial cash yield with a balance of $362 million invested in Europe at a 7.3% initial cash yield. We've seen meaningful improvements in both the U.S. and Europe. Our international markets continue to contribute a greater share of volume relative to prior years with healthy investment activity year-to-date, exemplifying the benefits we achieved by cultivating multiple avenues for growth. In total, we completed 70 discrete transactions, including four transactions over $50 million, which represented nearly 60% of our investment volume, highlighting the breadth of our platform. As I noted, the momentum we are seeing in the transaction market supports increase to this year's investment volume guidance to $3.5 billion. In the third quarter, our organic acquisition activity, which excludes credit investments as well as development spending largely negotiated in prior quarters totaled $594 million or more than double the second quarter's volume. We expect further momentum through the balance of the year, with an implied fourth quarter outlook of approximately $1.3 billion in investments, which is fully funded as we are vigilantly focused on deploying capital into high-quality opportunities that meet our risk-adjusted return requirements. Capital deployed in the third quarter yielded an investment spread of 243 basis points, above our historical average spread of 150 basis points. This spread was supported by $165 million of adjusted free cash flow available after dividend payments to fund investments. These spreads are based on our short-term nominal cost of capital that measures the year one dilution from utilizing external capital and excess free cash flow on a leverage-neutral basis to fund our investment volume. As a reminder, our ultimate investment decisions are based on our long-term weighted average cost of capital, which burdens every dollar of equity with the same cost of equity. Underpinning our increased investment activity of external capital improved by approximately 65 basis points in the third quarter. This compares to the decline in our weighted average initial cash yield of approximately 50 basis points during the quarter. Turning to portfolio operations. We've created a diversified portfolio of more than 15,400 properties with high-quality clients that have proven resilient through various economic cycles and continue to deliver stable returns. In addition, our vast data availability, proprietary predictive analytic tools and insights of our asset management and research teams enhance our ability to anticipate future trends. We finished the quarter with 98.7% occupancy, a 10-basis point decrease from the prior quarter. Our rent recapture rate on the 170 leases we renewed was 105% and totaling approximately $38 million in new annualized cash rent, thanks to the diligent efforts of our team. Separately, we are continuing to lean into dispositions as an additional source of capital. In the third quarter, we sold 92 properties for total net proceeds of $249 million, of which $87 million was related to vacant properties. This brings our year-to-date total to $451 million. For the year, we now expect proceeds of $550 million to $600 million in asset sales. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Jonathan to discuss our third quarter financial results in more detail.\nJonathan Pong: Thank you, Sumit. We are pleased to deliver over another strong quarter while increasing our investment in AFFO guidance for the year, reflecting continued momentum. Consistent with our investment strategy, we remain disciplined in our balance sheet management. Our strong balance sheet underscored by A3/A- credit ratings and deep access to capital globally continue to represent significant competitive advantages, fueling the opportunity to grow earnings through multiple channels. Our leverage, as measured by net debt to annualized pro forma adjusted EBITDA was a healthy 5.4x, well within our target ratio or 5.2x including $969 million of unsettled forward equity outstanding as of today. Our fixed charge coverage ratio of 4.6x remains in line with the 4.5 to 4.7x range. We have delivered consistently over the last seven quarters. A focus on derisking our future funding needs was a catalyst behind our two bond offerings during the third quarter, which consisted of a $500 million 30-year U.S. dollar bond offering and an effective semiannual yield to maturity of 5.49% and a dual tranche sterling bond offering that raised \u00a3700 million at a weighted average tenor of 11.1 years and a weighted average annual yield maturity of 5.4%. These offerings illustrate the diversity of debt products available to us and the intentionality of our capital diversification philosophy. Our 30-year offering was our first 30-year issuance since 2017, and our public sterling offering was our fifth non-U.S. public bond offering in approximately three years, bringing our foreign denominated outstanding unsecured debt to over $8 billion. We are grateful for the loyal support we have received from the fixed income community as we continue to expand our credit presence globally. At quarter end, we held $5.2 billion of liquidity, including unsettled forward equity, in addition to retaining almost full capacity net of cash available on our $4.25 billion revolving credit facility, only 3.4% of our outstanding debt at the end of the quarter was variable rate in nature, illustrating the financing flexibility we have heading into the end of the year. Access to capital is paramount to the success of our company and our portfolio size, scale, diversification and our trading liquidity in the public markets, have consistently afforded us well all priced capital to grow with large-scale, high-quality investment opportunities. With that said, we strive to demonstrate a proactive forward-looking mindset as we plan, position and evolve our financing strategy for future growth. Over the last few years, we have evaluated additional sources of equity capital beyond the public markets and have recently begun in earnest to build a private capital infrastructure that we believe, over time, will leverage our strengths and expand the breadth of our capital allocation opportunities globally. I would like to hand it back to Sumit to provide additional color. Sumit?\nSumit Roy: Thank you, Jonathan. As we mentioned last year, a natural step in our evolution is to diversify and enlarge our access to equity capital through private markets. We see multiple strategic benefits of entering the private capital business. First, the amount of equity available from private sources far exceeds that, which is available through the public markets we have traditionally accessed. The size of the U.S. private real estate market is approximately $18.8 trillion, 10x larger than the $1.9 trillion of assets owned by public REITs. Thus, private capital controls more than 90% of the U.S. commercial real estate market based on research from the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. Creation of a private capital investment platform is expected to provide us with access to a deep pool of institutional capital from investors who may otherwise lack the mandate or ability to invest in real estate securities. Second, access to the alternative source of equity with generally less pricing volatility will give us the opportunity to accelerate the monetization of the scalable and proven investment in operating platform we have built, in turn, supporting our ability to continue delivering value to shareholders. Third, a powerful element of the fund management strategy is the incremental capital-light fee earnings it's anticipated to offer. Base management income earned by managing third-party capital represents a source of recurring and potentially high-growth revenue, which we observed as receiving a premium multiple from the investment community. The vast majority of fees earned would be recurring in nature and generated through open-end perpetual life funds rather than performance-based or transaction-oriented fees. Fourth, the capability of our differentiated business model will allow us to advance this initiative with limited incremental investment while leveraging the collective talent and experience of our top-tier team and platform. We have a long history of underwriting, operating and maximizing the value of our real estate holdings, dating back to our founding in 1969. Leveraging that history, we have harnessed an impressive quantum of property level data to develop our proprietary predictive analytics model to support decision-making. With additional size and scale, these data-driven insights will become increasingly robust and accurate. Together with the expertise of our team, we believe we provide a compelling co-investing platform for investors. Finally, we believe private capital will enable us to source, acquire and manage a large percentage of available market opportunities that we currently acquire for the public vehicle. Overall, our intent is to create and operate an evergreen open-end fund that will manage private capital on behalf of institutional investors, such as pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments, foundations and large insurance companies. To be clear, this structure will be distinct from a typical private equity style closed-end fund that may have a fixed duration or a narrower opportunity set. Importantly, this fund will be designated to target institutional investors. It will not be structured as a non-traded REIT, and we do not intend to market to high net worth or retail investors. Our fund business is expected to follow the same balance sheet and prudent leverage philosophy that Realty Income describes today. We do not anticipate an adverse impact on our balance sheet strength or credit ratings Rather, it will enhance our financial flexibility. Realty Income intends to be a meaningful co-investor in the fund while receiving management and potentially incentive fees generated by operation of the fund. These additional earnings would bolster Realty Income's return on investment while ensuring incentives between public and private investors are aligned. This approach also reinforces our commitment to transparency and shared objectives. In summary, we believe this private capital platform will be complementary and additive to our existing business. We intend to take a thoughtful approach to allocating investment opportunities between realty income and the fund to maximize the returns for our public shareholders, benefiting both our shareholders and private investors. We expect this initiative to enhance our ability to grow our earnings and dividend, expand our addressable market for investments and reduce our reliance on public equity across market cycles when strategically advantageous. We look forward to sharing more information as we progress on launching the fund. In closing, our year-to-date performance has exceeded our expectations, propelled by momentum on the investment front and supported by the stability of our portfolio, consisting of leading clients across the globe. Looking forward, I'm optimistic about the multiple verticals for growth we have cultivated for capital deployment. Importantly, pairing these growth verticals with alternative sources of capital will further accelerate the maturation of our platform. I would now like to open it up for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Today's first question comes from John Kilichowski with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nJohn Kilichowski: Maybe if we could jump to the 3Q acquisition guide -- or excuse me, just the acquisition numbers you put up and then talk about the acquisition guide for 4Q. There was a good bit of cap rate compression. Just curious what's going on in the acquisition market. And then maybe part two of that would be, you have a big step-up in terms of acquisition volumes. I'm curious if you can speak to the potential for maybe a transaction on the large 7-Eleven deal. And then if so, given where we've talked about cap rates being for that deal, is that accretive to your long-term weighted average cost of capital?\nSumit Roy: There's a lot of questions you've asked, John. So let me just take it one at a time. The $740 million that we did in the third quarter at a 7.4% cap rate, you're absolutely right. It is 50 basis points inside of what we did in the second quarter, which was a 7.9% cap, but it is also a function of the cost of capital. If you notice, our cost of capital improved during the third quarter vis-a-vis what we were at the beginning of the year. And that improvement was about 65 basis points. So, despite the 50 basis points of cash yield compression, the fact that our cost of capital has improved by 65 basis points, it was more accretive to do the transactions that we did in the third quarter with the lower cost of capital that we were able to experience versus what we had done in the first half. So, to look at anything in isolation, just based on cap rate or just based on cost of capital, I think may lead you to the wrong conclusion. So, I would request that you take those two pieces in conjunction to figure out what is the true spread that we are being able to cultivate through these investments. The second question that you had was around the $1.3 billion approximately that we are anticipating closing in the fourth quarter. It is true that we have a very healthy pipeline and it is largely a function of what we were experiencing for most of the -- all of the third quarter, say for what's happened over the last week, 1.5 weeks where there's been a lot more volatility on the cost of capital side. But that has allowed us to basically build our pipeline and we have essentially forward funded [Technical Difficulty] in the public markets to help finance what we are planning on achieving with regards to our fourth quarter numbers. The volatility in the cost of capital is something that we always take into account when we are looking at potential opportunities and making sure that we have enough margin of safety in any particular transaction that we pursue is critical to how we think about making investments. And long term, making sure that our hurdle rates on the long-term cost of capital is superseded by, again, a healthy margin is inherently important to what we do. I'm not going to go into specifics around what transactions make up the fourth quarter. But we've heard certain comments around there being a difference in when you're buying a large portfolio versus the one-off market. I can assure you that we are in the one-off market every day. And just because you mentioned 7-Eleven, there are 35 transactions that have taken place in 2024 year-to-date and with the same approximate lease term, et cetera, if you look at where they traded, they traded at a 5 to 9 cap rate. Anytime we are pursuing a portfolio deal and there were large -- four large portfolio deals that we were able to accomplish in the third quarter, we make sure that it is at a discount to what we would be able to find in the one-off market. And that has played out, if you look at what our, the actual rent is compared to market rent that we bought, the $740 million. The rent that is inherent in that $740 million of investments is 6% below market and 26% below replacement costs. That is why we feel very confident that on a risk-adjusted basis, the transactions that we are pursuing are ones that will create long-term value for our investors.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Greg McGinniss of Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nGreg McGinniss: Sumit, although you mentioned an improving acquisition environment benefiting full year investments based on this foray into private capital market equity raising, it seems like kind of inherently saying the limiting factor on acquisition volume this year has been capital raising and not lack of sourcing investments at widened up spreads. Do you expect the cost of equity in the fund business is going to be lower? And how well investment philosophies between the fund and core business differ to avoid any potential conflicts of interest when determining where an investment should be placed?\nSumit Roy: That's a very good question, Greg. The biggest difference between the private markets and the public markets that I can point to is this focus on first year spread versus a focus on long-term IRR. When we are looking at a particular transaction that is inside of our historical spreads, which has been 150 basis points, we hesitate to pursue that transaction because it is not in line with what we can generate in the first year. And as you know, better than most, that we are valued off of that initial spread that we are able to capture, which then translates into AFFO per share growth. But that does not allow us to pursue transactions that have a similar, potentially even a higher total return profile given the inherent growth, et cetera, that they might have despite having a much lower initial cash cap rate. That is where we feel like being able to access private capital that has similar expectations on the long-term horizon, the return horizon that we have -- we focus on even as a standalone public entity, but not with that short-term focus, as acutely as the public entity does, will allow us to expand our sandbox and make investments alongside this private capital business, to take advantage of much higher growth rate opportunities, but potentially at a lower initial yield. So, we think of this as truly complementary to our business. Go ahead. Were you going to ask something else?\nGreg McGinniss: Yes. I just was hoping you might be able to give us maybe some examples as to types of investments or tenants that you guys have had to pass up on because of current structure versus what this this new type of equity capital will allow you to pursue?\nSumit Roy: Sure. Industrial is a perfect example. We've looked at opportunities in the 5.5 ZIP code. We cannot go there today, as based on where our cost of capital is, with 3% growth, 20-year leases. You do the math and you're going to have a return profile, that is very much in line with what we're looking for long term, but we can't pursue that particular transaction because of what the -- maybe not the dilution, but the non-spread day one, that's a perfect example. There are other asset types. Data centers being a perfect example of another asset type that is going to fall squarely in this bucket, which we may not be able to pursue currently given our cost of capital. And that is a particular area of the business that we believe can help drive earnings growth for the public entity in years to come.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brad Heffern of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nBrad Heffern: Yes. So, it sounds like really the target for the fund would be just a lower cap rate opportunity set. I'm curious, do you expect that there would be any overlap in the investment profiles between the two vehicles?\nSumit Roy: Of course, we are going to continue to be a very large equity holder in the fund. So, our interests are going to be perfectly aligned. So, there will be a lot of opportunities that we are going to be looking at, which actually works for both entities long term, but potentially in the short term does not work for the stand-alone public entity. But this is also going to be a function of the capital raising. We are not going to be buying things into the farm that we would never have touched even taking the long-term return profile into account as a public entity. So, this is truly to enhance the box and to pursuit transactions, assuming our capital raising is successful, and participate together through the fund structure. That is how we would like to deploy capital.\nBrad Heffern: Okay. And then, do you have any sort of target in mind for a size where it makes sense, given just the added complication?\nSumit Roy: I hope it's going to be very simple. What causes added complication. Well, it's a different pocket of capital, but unlike pockets of capital that have finite life, this is a perpetual vehicle. And we are going to be very large co-investors in this perpetual vehicle. And for all intents and purposes, it will be fully consolidated with our financial statements. So, you will have perfect visibility. The fact that we have scale and the fact that we have a platform that we are very proud of, unfortunately, does not get valued at points in time by the public markets. And this is a way for us to monetize this platform and, therefore, incur very little incremental cost to stand up this vehicle. That, too, is a value that our current platform is going to bring. And I might go so far as to say that given our size and scale, which we have talked about being such a massive advantage, this is one of the ways that we can show that to the market.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Smedes Rose with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nSmedes Rose: I wanted to ask a little bit about the $63 million charge in the quarter related to convenience store client. Is that related to the same client where you took some smaller charges in the first half of the year? And could you maybe just talk a little bit more about kind of what the outcome be there? I guess you can't name the client, but maybe just a little more color around what's going on there?\nJonathan Pong: First of all, I'd say we absolutely expect a fair welcome. We've talked historically about situations where we've had credit issues in the portfolio, we've recouped north of 80% of rent that's been impacted. As it relates to the accounting that drove the $64 million charge, it's noncash first and foremost, it really has to do with the fact that upon the allocation of the original purchase price. You've got land, you've got building and then you've got the intangible, which is meant to account for the future cash flows inherent in the lease. And so, the reserve that you see, which rolls into impairment, but is classified because these were originally sale leasebacks as a financing receivable. And that's really just a difference in nomenclature and that's why it's excluded from AFFO is noncash. And we've already expensively accounted for all of the lost rent for the entire of 2024 that's built into our guidance.\nSumit Roy: And I'll just add it to that just because we're talking about credit, let me just share a bit more. I mean these are assets that we really want to one control over. And we are doing everything in our power to get control of this asset. It is essentially a client who's decided not to pay rent while operating these assets. And given the work that the asset management team has done, we already have a tremendous amount of interest in these assets, which are primarily located in Texas. And so, we feel very confident about being able to replace the rent, which is not significant in this case. The actual cash rent that is very quickly once we gain control. So that's this convenience store operator. But while we are on the topic of credit, I want to walk you through some of what has dominated the conversations over the last few quarters. Red Lobster has emerged from bankruptcy and just hired a CEO. They've hired a Chief Marketing Officer. They've got a new CFO. Let me close the storyline on that. We had 216 assets, pre-bankruptcy. Nine assets were rejected through bankruptcy. We had a 91% recapture rate on that particular name. Rite Aid. We have 29 locations today. We had an 88% recapture rate on Rite Aid, which is now emerged from bankruptcy and is an ongoing concern. Regal, where we have 35 assets today and an 85% recapture rate and it has emerged from bankruptcy. So those are the story lines that have dominated multiple quarters of conversations, and this is the end result of all of those conversations. Let's talk about Walgreens. Everybody is concerned about what used to be a 2,000 store closings, which has now been reduced to 1,500. Year-to-date, we've had 13 Walgreens come up for renewal. They had lease maturity. All 13 were renewed by Walgreens. In our history of 55 renewals with Walgreens, we've had a recapture rate of over 100%. Let's throw CVS in that mix. We've had 40 leases renew with CVS in our history at over 102% renewal. Let's talk about Family Dollar, Dollar Tree. We've had 135 lease renewals with Family Dollar, Dollar Tree in our history at over 108% renewal rate. Dollar General is a similar story. So, I just asked that what we see in the headlines don't necessarily translate to what is happening on the ground for our portfolio. And that's the emphasis I want to make is that we are very selective and the data proves that out to be the case. Go ahead, Smedes. Sorry, I cut you off.\nSmedes Rose: No. No. I mean I appreciate the detail is understood. But of course, as we see these headlines, we have to ask about them, right? I mean that's the nature of the business. I wanted to ask you on the -- just going back to the fund for a moment. You -- I think it was asked previously, but I don't think I heard the answer. Just do you have a sense of kind of what the scope of the fund would be? And are we talking maybe $1 billion to start? Or would you see it in several billions? Or kind of how do you think about the size of the fund, I guess, initially and maybe how it might grow over time?\nSumit Roy: Yes. It's too early to tell. We obviously believe in our pieces. We believe in what we are doing. We believe it's -- the benefits of what we are doing is going to accrue to our public shareholders, but it is too early Smedes me to opine on how big this could potentially become.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Jay Kornreich with SMBC. Please go ahead.\nJay Kornreich: I was wondering if you can comment on kind of the opportunities that you're currently seeing in Europe? And as you see things today, are you looking into exploring into new territories and do you expect that acquisition opportunity in Europe to continue to outpace the U.S.?\nSumit Roy: That's a great question, Jay, given what we've done in the quarters, it is a legitimate question. Yes, 56% of what we've done year-to-date has been in Europe, but we view that as an advantage that's precisely the reason why we created all of these growth verticals to be able to take advantage of wherever the best opportunities reside. And Europe is where we found that to be the case for the first three quarters. I believe the momentum in Europe will continue. We are seeing very good opportunities in Europe. And yes, our ability to go beyond our current geography, by geography, I mean, countries in Europe is also something that we are constantly looking. And so, for the right opportunity, there are several countries that we don't happen to be in that we would consider going into with the right client and with the right opportunity. Jay had asked about the future as well. And so, the $1.3 billion that's expected in the fourth quarter, I want to close a loop on that. The momentum that I had referenced was the momentum that we are seeing here in the U.S. In Europe, the momentum has continued. It's been there at the beginning of the year. That momentum has continued, but it's in the fourth quarter that you will see it reverting back to more historical norms in terms of U.S. versus international.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nHaendel St. Juste: Sumit, I wanted to go back to the fund one more time. There appears to be a long list of benefits that you mentioned already, but I'm also thinking that there could be a long-term benefit of allowing you at some point to potentially generate mid-single-digit AFFO growth, your long-term kind of core growth target without the need for sizable annual equity raises when you think about your existing rent bumps and the reinvestment of your free cash flow. So, I guess, first, is that fair? And then maybe some color on if you'd look to fund it with existing assets within your portfolio and what that mix could look like?\nSumit Roy: That's a very good question, Haendel. Thank you. And you're right. I mean, the idea here is we get into this business to expand the investable universe for ourselves and for the fund while making sure that we adhere to the return expectations of all parties concerned. Look, it's a mathematical fact that it's not an issue today, but 10 years from now, at the rate we are growing, if we continue to rely on just the public markets to finance our growth, we're going to run up into capacity issues. I don't believe that the public markets are, especially the fund business in the public markets are growing at the same level that we have expectations of growing as a public entity. And so, it is not a dearth of opportunities that is driving this desire to get into the fund business. it is making sure that this complementary source of equity capital will help us monetize our platform and create a business that will then allow us to continue the momentum that we have shown over the last 55 years, 30 of which has been as a public entity. That is the goal of what we are trying to do. And outside of the initial call it, seating of this fund, which, by the way, that portfolio will look and feel very similar to what Realty income looks like. And at the appropriate time, all of that will get disclosed, is a way to attract capital and start our business. But subsequently, it will be new transactions that they participate in, either alongside us or it will be on balance sheet for the public entity. That's how the business is going to function.\nHaendel St. Juste: No, that's incremental. I appreciate that. And one more, and I'm not sure if you answered it, but I didn't quite catch if the pipeline for the fourth quarter, if you expect the cap rates to be comparable or lower? And then just thinking about the uptick in volume into the fourth quarter, if that's an appropriate run rate to think about into next year?\nSumit Roy: Yes. Haendel, I'm not going to opine on cap rates, et cetera, because things can move around quite a bit. But what I will tell you is that the spread that we are going to make will be -- will continue to be healthy and will continue to be north of our historical spreads. That you can take a fair amount of confidence. And the other piece I'll leave you with Haendel is, we have already prefunded our need for the fourth quarter. So, there is no reliance on the public markets to help fund this $1.3 billion that we are planning on doing in the fourth quarter. Hopefully, that helps.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Spenser Allaway with Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.\nSpenser Allaway: One more on the private fund. Can you maybe just talk about how time will be spent just in terms of underwriting deals and opportunities for the team in general, but also for you, Sumit. And then I know you commented on economies of scale around our data and data analytics. But just curious, if you foresee any changes to headcount or to the investment process just in the early stages of that launch?\nSumit Roy: That's a great question, Spenser, because it really goes to the heart of when I say we're going to scale -- use our scale as a company that we are today to mitigate what would be an insurmountable cost for a start-up to stop this business. We have 465 people in the business. We already have a fully staffed investment arm, both here in the U.S. as well as in the U.K. and in Amsterdam, taking care of our international business. So, we don't see any need or any incremental personnel on the investment side. That's scale benefit, number 1. Scale benefit number two. We are going to be agnostic as to whether these assets are held in a fund, which, by the way, the public entity will have a fairly large interest in or whether it is on balance sheet. And thus, our asset management team that has done a superb job on the public side, both here in the U.S. as well as in the international markets in London, they will continue to manage these assets. That's benefit number two. Any dispositions, any elements of that, we already have the team here. We have a very large legal team that we are going to leverage that obviously is a massive source of pride for us given that we do a majority of the work in-house. We will continue to lean on them to help with transaction negotiations, lease negotiations, et cetera. That scale benefits, number three. We already have the setup in place -- and so we are not going to be needing new people to help do the block and tackle work that is required of an investment arm where we will have incremental cost will be around a fund manager and the reporting as well as an IR function that will be dealing with a very specific type of investor base on the private side. But outside of that, from accounting finance, which, by the way, is again something we are very proud of, will all be leveraged with the existing platform that we have. That's my comment around the incremental cost in standing this business up will be fairly muted.\nSpenser Allaway: Very helpful. And then just last one, can you talk about how the competitive landscape is changing? Or if there's been any changes in the U.S. and Europe right now as it relates to the transaction market?\nSumit Roy: Yes, Spenser, it's the -- it's very fluid in terms of who we are starting to compete against. There is no doubt that private arms are becoming much bigger players in transactions that we are pursuing. And of course, we've had a few more companies in the net lease space that have become public. We don't run into most of them given the types of transactions that we pursue, but it is a crowded field in terms of competition here in the U.S. In the international market, it continues to be one of the biggest advantages that we have, where we are running into more competition today than we did, let's call it, a year or two years ago, but we -- but it's still not quite as intense as what we experienced here in the U.S. And most of that competition comes from private capital in the international market. So, that's the flavor of who we compete against in the U.S. and in the international markets.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Upal Rana with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nUpal Rana: Sumit, you talked about the momentum in the transaction market, an but I wanted to kind of get a sense on have buyers and sellers really reacted to that 50 basis points rate cut and with another 25 basis points cut likely this week and then with the 10-year really driving higher about 65 basis points since the last Fed rate cuts. So, I want to get good sense on that.\nSumit Roy: Yes. I think, Upal, so much of the volatility across the curve at this point is around what will happen today. And it's the largest exogenous factor that's going to determine where the curve settles down. We are not as exposed to the short end of the curve. We are -- but it's not to the same extent as we are to the long end of the curve. And so, what's happening on the long end of the curve definitely has an impact on our cost of capital because that becomes a permanent source of financing and our ability to pursue transactions. And that is a function of inflation expectations that people have about the future. And if policies are going to get put into place, where the inflation expectation is going to suddenly be much higher than what it had been traditionally, that is going to have an impact on where the tenure is going to settle and that will certainly have an impact either on the positive side or on the negative side for the permanent cost of capital for a net lease business. And those are largely policy driven. We've had parties coming up with proposals that have a diverse set of impacts on this particular inflation expectations. So too early to tell where all of this is going to settle. It is creating a fair amount of volatility, and we are hopeful that regardless of who wins, once we have more clarity in terms of what the curve is going to look like, we'll be able to execute on business as usual.\nUpal Rana: Great. That was helpful. And then last one for me. Going back to the private capital fund. I know you've already listed a bunch of benefits there. But I wanted to get your sense on why now and why this makes sense in today's economic environment. And I know you mentioned capacity could be an issue in the future, but is there anything else that you may have been dealing with that was creating some friction on your end?\nSumit Roy: Really, Upal, there is nothing that we are seeing either on the credit side. I think I went through a pretty detailed list to share with you that on the credit side, we feel very good. Our credit watch list actually came down by 10 basis points to 4.2%. And from the previous quarter. So, we feel very good on the credit side. We feel very good on the health of the market to precipitate transactions setting aside what's happened over the last couple of weeks, but that too shall pass is our expectation. Really, the timing is around to do this right, which obviously is our collective desire. We want to do this very slowly and we want to do it very thoughtfully and it's going to take a long time, a long time for this to become a mature business. I mean look at one of our peers who has probably one of the most successful open-ended fund businesses, and that's Prologis. And they've been in that business for 20-plus years. And today, it has become -- we can step back and say it is a super successful business that some very smart people went into 20 years ago. And so, in anticipation of what could happen 10 years from now, et cetera, when we start to run up against this, our desire to put out capital and perhaps the limits of just accessing the capital sources that we have today, that could become more acute. And so, we have to start today to build this history and to build this fun business to a point where it really starts to bear fruit for our public shareholders et cetera. And that's it. That's why we are doing it today. There is no -- there is -- it doesn't matter at which point in the cycle we would have done this, that question would and should be asked, but it's really about starting now when we don't have a need for additional capital and building this business to get ahead of what could be a limiting factor multiple years down the road.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Linda Tsai with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nLinda Tsai: Just a few quick ones. Can you give us an update on where 2024 bad debt year-to-date has trended? And what's your outlook for '25?\nJonathan Pong: Yes. So, Linda, if you look at the earnings release, first nine months of this year, we've incurred about $6 million in bad debt expense. That's around 40 basis points of our rental revenue. When you take out this one C-store operator that we referenced earlier. You're really looking at sub-20 basis points on 18 basis points. We've talked historically about how when you exclude the pandemic, we've been right there around 25 basis points of credit loss in a given year as a percentage of revenue. So, to be at 18 outside of these onetime unusual events, we think is pretty indicative of a very constructive and healthy portfolio.\nSumit Roy: And I think we -- as Sumit alluded to earlier, the credit loss was at 4.2%. There's really not a lot out there that we're really monitoring that meaningful. There's no 1-plus percent exposure tenants on there. We feel as though those that are on the watch list, we've been monitoring for quite some time. And in some cases, we have very good visibility into the cash flow coverage on these assets. And so, we'll get into all of the assumptions that we're baking in for 2025 come February when we release our guidance.\nLinda Tsai: And then in terms of the C-store write-down in the quarter, what's the potential AFFO impact on earnings? And then what do you think is the recapture rate?\nJonathan Pong: So, in terms of this one C-store operator, it's really, I call it $1 million a month or so. And all of that is built in. All of that is built into our guidance. And we'll see where we trend out to in terms of recovery. But as we referenced earlier, we do feel like there could be quite a bit of interest in these assets. So, I think the default response that we have to offer up is you look at our historical precedents and being able to get 84%, 85% or recapture of any rent that's been impacted by from bank or credit event.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Ronald Kamdem with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRonald Kamdem: Just two quick ones back to the fund. I think you talked about some of the investments that the fund would be interesting in the fund where the public equity couldn't do it. I guess my other question is just, is there any other differences in terms of dividend policy in terms of geography, like in the fund go anywhere? And in your mind, is that investor that's going into the fund, is that a completely different investor base that would contemplate the stock? Or is there some overlap?\nSumit Roy: Yes. Ron, we haven't really done any work on the investor profile, but the comments I made about how much bigger this investable universe is of potential investors to look to invest in real estate through a fund structure is what's so compelling. Is it possible that you have some of these funds that have ambit to invest in public securities and they have a mandate to invest in private direct investments? I'm sure that may be the case. But even those investors will tell you that what they have to invest through a fund structure directly into real estate is multiples of what they have on the security side. So, I can't give you a more precise answer than that, but the vast majority, I believe, are going to be investors who don't have the ability to invest in public securities but would like to utilize our platform, work with us and invest in the product that we invest in. And outside of that, the strategy is one that I've already touched on. There's not going to be anything new that the fund business is going to be doing that we won't do on balance sheet. Keep in mind that the goal is we will be a massive co-investor in this fund. And so, our interests are going to be perfectly aligned in terms of what it is that we pursue.\nRonald Kamdem: Great. And then my second quick one is just an update on sort of the data center sort of initiatives. Obviously, there's been a lot of data points about demand ramping? Just how are you guys sort of seeing the pipeline in that vertical evolving?\nSumit Roy: Yes. So, I won't talk about pipelines, Ronald, but what you've referenced in terms of the demand, we're seeing that in space. And we've been very lucky to be speaking with multiple operators in this space. We see it in terms of what they're showing us regarding the pipeline that they've created we are trying to craft a value proposition that is compelling to these operators. And we are very optimistic about where this particular business could go for realty income going forward. We feel like we can be a solution that helps meet some of the demand and the capital needs to execute on what is a once in a cycle type situation. And at the end of the day, we have capital allocators. And if we can allocate capital exposed to S&P 10, S&P 20 clients for 20 years, that's our core business. And so, we are excited, but it's too early to tell in terms of how this is all going to play out.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from R.J. Milligan at Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nR.J. Milligan: So, I wanted to ask a couple more questions on the funds, given those examples of some of the transactions that might be more appropriate there, has been helpful. And I wanted to be clear, do you expect the fund to invest in properties that might not necessarily have triple net leases and therefore, have better internal growth or more structured investments, development loans. So, I'm just trying to get an idea of what the mix is or if it's going to be pure triple net.\nSumit Roy: R.J., what I'll share with you is you should think of these investments in terms of flow-through, rental income flowing through to NOI to be very similar to what we've done on balance sheet right? The idea is not to go and start executing on businesses that have a 40% NOI margin. That's not what we do. And so, when we talk about data centers, we are not going to be going out there and buying colocation sites where the flow-through is very different versus hyperscale single-tenant 20-year leases that may not be precisely triple net, but the flow-through is still incredibly high, i.e., mimicking what a triple net asset should be generated. That's really the -- what we are going to be doing.\nR.J. Milligan: Okay. And then two quick follow-ups, and I may have missed the answers. But number one, do you expect the cost of equity to be higher or lower than Realty's.\nSumit Roy: So, the cost of equity as defined by long-term return hurdles should be very similar, but their focus is on the long-term hurdle rate, not on day one accretion. And that's the big difference, R.J. That's why I gave the examples that I did that the return profile long term is very similar for both of these businesses. But we, as a public entity, 100% public entity, today cannot meet our dual mandate of generating that year one spread and the long-term hurdle rate. Both those have to be met in order for us to pursue transactions in the public markets today. That's how we are valued, and we are very grateful for that. We understand that that's how -- that's the game we have to play. But there are assets that we are passing up on very high-quality assets that can meet the long-term hurdle, but will potentially have a much lower starting point. And that, I think, is what we'll be able to do through this fund structure and enhance our co-investment through the recurring asset management fee stream, which is essentially the monetization of the platform that we have. to the benefit of our public shareholders. That's how this will work.\nR.J. Milligan: Okay. And one last follow-up is, will Realty Income be contributing properties to the fund?\nSumit Roy: There will be a seat portfolio that will allow us to have conversations with potential investors. But thereafter, it will be new investments that we pursue. That's how we're thinking about it today. So outside of that initial seed portfolio, everything else will be new transactions that we'll be pursuing.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Greg McGinniss of Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nGreg McGinniss: Sumit, I just want to follow up on that last question. So, you mentioned Prologis, right? And I think that's where the contribution question comes from. But -- could you instead maybe envision increasing investment into developments, which may be otherwise you wouldn't have underwritten that would then be contributed to the platform? Or would you instead pursue those developments within the platform itself?\nSumit Roy: Greg, that's a very good question because when we pursue development, we do have certain accounting elements that we have to adhere to. And there are times where we are unable to recognize the full cash impact, the positive cash yield that we are able to generate on dollars that we are investing in a development scenario, just given the lease accounting that we have, that's certainly not going to be a prohibitive factor doing it through the fund structure. And so, could we do more of those? Yes. In the fund, the answer is yes. But again, it needs to meet and exceed the overall return hurdles that we would we would need to address. So, there are a lot of things that this alternative source of financing could allow us to do, which we have done as a public entity, but only in a limited way because of some of the inherent limitations that we have either in terms of how we can report stuff, et cetera. So, I do think that this will give us the flexibility and thus, the comment I made about expanding the sandbox of the types of transactions that we would be able to pursue by having this alternative source of capital available to us.\nGreg McGinniss: And do you already have kind of first investors in mind or conversations that you've had on this front?\nSumit Roy: We have none of that in mind. We have and I think I've talked about this, what is -- the profile of this investor would look like. We certainly have that, and we are working with our advisers who have shared with us what the details are around that, but we haven't had any conversations today.\nGreg McGinniss: Okay. And just final follow-up for Jonathan. Is there anything specific to point to in the slight increase in the midpoint to the expense leakage guidance?\nJonathan Pong: Yes. It's a combination of a few things. Greg, first of all, there's been some deferred expenses we brought forward, some that were carried forward from last year. We're just trying to get ahead of spend and trying to catch up in some cases. So, there is a little bit of heavier load this quarter. I would also say for this year, I would also say that there are some carry costs that we are incurring with a few vacant assets that do comprise a bit of an increase on a year-over-year basis from a margin perspective. And then also, I think when you're just comparing to the 1.1% leakage that we experienced last year, keep in mind we did bring in a $9 billion portfolio in January with the Spirit portfolio. And that did have slightly more leakage as well just on a run rate basis. So, I would really attribute it to those factors as what's driving the slight increase going from 1.1% and now to a midpoint of 1.35%.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Wes Golladay with Baird. Please go ahead.\nWes Golladay: I just want to have a question on the development pipeline. When do you expect the nonretail to lease up? Are you holding back leasing on that right now?\nSumit Roy: Yes, that's a great question, Wes. Look, it's a very small portion of the overall development. I think it's like 15% plus/minus in that ZIP code. And even though the quantum that we have identified for this particular type of development, we really don't spend until we get clarity on the leases coming through. And so, we feel very confident. We are partnering with one of the best developers in Panattoni, and we feel very confident that some of these are going to get leased up in the near term. And keep in mind, we won't make the big capital investment without having line of sight on potential clients being able to step in and take over those leases.\nWes Golladay: Maybe just a quick follow-up on that, since it's more spec in nature. Are you going to get a little bit more incremental yield?\nSumit Roy: Yes, absolutely. And in fact, in situations where -- we've had two buildings, one was leased and the other one wasn't. We have expectations and what we think the lease rates are going to be and -- so far, more often than not, those lease rates -- our expected lease rates have been superseded by what actually ends up happening. So, this continues to build a fair amount of confidence in not only our partners, but also our team's ability to underwrite these types of transactions.\nOperator: Thank you. And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Sumit Roy for any closing remarks.\nSumit Roy: Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking soon and seeing you at a conference in the coming weeks. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Sumit Roy",
            "content": "Thank you, Kelsy. Welcome, everyone. Realty Income's third quarter results highlight our continued momentum, disciplined execution and the benefits of our global investment and operating platform. Our value proposition to investors is simple, a real estate partner to the world's leading companies. We've created a defensive and diversified real estate portfolio consisting of top-tier clients to drive stable and predictable cash flow. As a result, we've delivered positive total operational returns each year since becoming a public company 30 years ago, successfully navigating a variety of economic environments. Importantly, as we move through an improving external backdrop helped by a recent rate cut in the U.S., we've started to see a more attractive transaction landscape. Given this, we are pleased to increase our 2024 investment volume guidance to approximately $3.5 billion, underpinned by strong investment activity year-to-date as well as a robust pipeline for the fourth quarter. Concurrently, we are raising the low end of our AFFO per share guidance for the year to a range of $4.17 to $4.21. Despite some recent volatility driven by exogenous factors, we remain confident in our strategic vision and the opportunity ahead. Our investment strategy offers significant opportunities for growth across multiple verticals, including our core of retail and industrial and newer verticals such as data centers and gaming. At the same time, we are making progress towards the establishment of a private capital fund, which I'll touch on later in this call. Turning to the details of the third quarter. We delivered AFFO per share of $1.05, representing a 2.9% growth compared to last year. We invested $740 million into high-quality opportunities at a blended 7.4% initial cash yield or a 7.8% straight-line yield assuming CPI growth of 2%. Of this, $378 million of volume was invested in the U.S. at a 7.4% initial cash yield with a balance of $362 million invested in Europe at a 7.3% initial cash yield. We've seen meaningful improvements in both the U.S. and Europe. Our international markets continue to contribute a greater share of volume relative to prior years with healthy investment activity year-to-date, exemplifying the benefits we achieved by cultivating multiple avenues for growth. In total, we completed 70 discrete transactions, including four transactions over $50 million, which represented nearly 60% of our investment volume, highlighting the breadth of our platform. As I noted, the momentum we are seeing in the transaction market supports increase to this year's investment volume guidance to $3.5 billion. In the third quarter, our organic acquisition activity, which excludes credit investments as well as development spending largely negotiated in prior quarters totaled $594 million or more than double the second quarter's volume. We expect further momentum through the balance of the year, with an implied fourth quarter outlook of approximately $1.3 billion in investments, which is fully funded as we are vigilantly focused on deploying capital into high-quality opportunities that meet our risk-adjusted return requirements. Capital deployed in the third quarter yielded an investment spread of 243 basis points, above our historical average spread of 150 basis points. This spread was supported by $165 million of adjusted free cash flow available after dividend payments to fund investments. These spreads are based on our short-term nominal cost of capital that measures the year one dilution from utilizing external capital and excess free cash flow on a leverage-neutral basis to fund our investment volume. As a reminder, our ultimate investment decisions are based on our long-term weighted average cost of capital, which burdens every dollar of equity with the same cost of equity. Underpinning our increased investment activity of external capital improved by approximately 65 basis points in the third quarter. This compares to the decline in our weighted average initial cash yield of approximately 50 basis points during the quarter. Turning to portfolio operations. We've created a diversified portfolio of more than 15,400 properties with high-quality clients that have proven resilient through various economic cycles and continue to deliver stable returns. In addition, our vast data availability, proprietary predictive analytic tools and insights of our asset management and research teams enhance our ability to anticipate future trends. We finished the quarter with 98.7% occupancy, a 10-basis point decrease from the prior quarter. Our rent recapture rate on the 170 leases we renewed was 105% and totaling approximately $38 million in new annualized cash rent, thanks to the diligent efforts of our team. Separately, we are continuing to lean into dispositions as an additional source of capital. In the third quarter, we sold 92 properties for total net proceeds of $249 million, of which $87 million was related to vacant properties. This brings our year-to-date total to $451 million. For the year, we now expect proceeds of $550 million to $600 million in asset sales. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Jonathan to discuss our third quarter financial results in more detail. Thank you, Jonathan. As we mentioned last year, a natural step in our evolution is to diversify and enlarge our access to equity capital through private markets. We see multiple strategic benefits of entering the private capital business. First, the amount of equity available from private sources far exceeds that, which is available through the public markets we have traditionally accessed. The size of the U.S. private real estate market is approximately $18.8 trillion, 10x larger than the $1.9 trillion of assets owned by public REITs. Thus, private capital controls more than 90% of the U.S. commercial real estate market based on research from the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. Creation of a private capital investment platform is expected to provide us with access to a deep pool of institutional capital from investors who may otherwise lack the mandate or ability to invest in real estate securities. Second, access to the alternative source of equity with generally less pricing volatility will give us the opportunity to accelerate the monetization of the scalable and proven investment in operating platform we have built, in turn, supporting our ability to continue delivering value to shareholders. Third, a powerful element of the fund management strategy is the incremental capital-light fee earnings it's anticipated to offer. Base management income earned by managing third-party capital represents a source of recurring and potentially high-growth revenue, which we observed as receiving a premium multiple from the investment community. The vast majority of fees earned would be recurring in nature and generated through open-end perpetual life funds rather than performance-based or transaction-oriented fees. Fourth, the capability of our differentiated business model will allow us to advance this initiative with limited incremental investment while leveraging the collective talent and experience of our top-tier team and platform. We have a long history of underwriting, operating and maximizing the value of our real estate holdings, dating back to our founding in 1969. Leveraging that history, we have harnessed an impressive quantum of property level data to develop our proprietary predictive analytics model to support decision-making. With additional size and scale, these data-driven insights will become increasingly robust and accurate. Together with the expertise of our team, we believe we provide a compelling co-investing platform for investors. Finally, we believe private capital will enable us to source, acquire and manage a large percentage of available market opportunities that we currently acquire for the public vehicle. Overall, our intent is to create and operate an evergreen open-end fund that will manage private capital on behalf of institutional investors, such as pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, endowments, foundations and large insurance companies. To be clear, this structure will be distinct from a typical private equity style closed-end fund that may have a fixed duration or a narrower opportunity set. Importantly, this fund will be designated to target institutional investors. It will not be structured as a non-traded REIT, and we do not intend to market to high net worth or retail investors. Our fund business is expected to follow the same balance sheet and prudent leverage philosophy that Realty Income describes today. We do not anticipate an adverse impact on our balance sheet strength or credit ratings Rather, it will enhance our financial flexibility. Realty Income intends to be a meaningful co-investor in the fund while receiving management and potentially incentive fees generated by operation of the fund. These additional earnings would bolster Realty Income's return on investment while ensuring incentives between public and private investors are aligned. This approach also reinforces our commitment to transparency and shared objectives. In summary, we believe this private capital platform will be complementary and additive to our existing business. We intend to take a thoughtful approach to allocating investment opportunities between realty income and the fund to maximize the returns for our public shareholders, benefiting both our shareholders and private investors. We expect this initiative to enhance our ability to grow our earnings and dividend, expand our addressable market for investments and reduce our reliance on public equity across market cycles when strategically advantageous. We look forward to sharing more information as we progress on launching the fund. In closing, our year-to-date performance has exceeded our expectations, propelled by momentum on the investment front and supported by the stability of our portfolio, consisting of leading clients across the globe. Looking forward, I'm optimistic about the multiple verticals for growth we have cultivated for capital deployment. Importantly, pairing these growth verticals with alternative sources of capital will further accelerate the maturation of our platform. I would now like to open it up for questions. Operator? There's a lot of questions you've asked, John. So let me just take it one at a time. The $740 million that we did in the third quarter at a 7.4% cap rate, you're absolutely right. It is 50 basis points inside of what we did in the second quarter, which was a 7.9% cap, but it is also a function of the cost of capital. If you notice, our cost of capital improved during the third quarter vis-a-vis what we were at the beginning of the year. And that improvement was about 65 basis points. So, despite the 50 basis points of cash yield compression, the fact that our cost of capital has improved by 65 basis points, it was more accretive to do the transactions that we did in the third quarter with the lower cost of capital that we were able to experience versus what we had done in the first half. So, to look at anything in isolation, just based on cap rate or just based on cost of capital, I think may lead you to the wrong conclusion. So, I would request that you take those two pieces in conjunction to figure out what is the true spread that we are being able to cultivate through these investments. The second question that you had was around the $1.3 billion approximately that we are anticipating closing in the fourth quarter. It is true that we have a very healthy pipeline and it is largely a function of what we were experiencing for most of the -- all of the third quarter, say for what's happened over the last week, 1.5 weeks where there's been a lot more volatility on the cost of capital side. But that has allowed us to basically build our pipeline and we have essentially forward funded [Technical Difficulty] in the public markets to help finance what we are planning on achieving with regards to our fourth quarter numbers. The volatility in the cost of capital is something that we always take into account when we are looking at potential opportunities and making sure that we have enough margin of safety in any particular transaction that we pursue is critical to how we think about making investments. And long term, making sure that our hurdle rates on the long-term cost of capital is superseded by, again, a healthy margin is inherently important to what we do. I'm not going to go into specifics around what transactions make up the fourth quarter. But we've heard certain comments around there being a difference in when you're buying a large portfolio versus the one-off market. I can assure you that we are in the one-off market every day. And just because you mentioned 7-Eleven, there are 35 transactions that have taken place in 2024 year-to-date and with the same approximate lease term, et cetera, if you look at where they traded, they traded at a 5 to 9 cap rate. Anytime we are pursuing a portfolio deal and there were large -- four large portfolio deals that we were able to accomplish in the third quarter, we make sure that it is at a discount to what we would be able to find in the one-off market. And that has played out, if you look at what our, the actual rent is compared to market rent that we bought, the $740 million. The rent that is inherent in that $740 million of investments is 6% below market and 26% below replacement costs. That is why we feel very confident that on a risk-adjusted basis, the transactions that we are pursuing are ones that will create long-term value for our investors. That's a very good question, Greg. The biggest difference between the private markets and the public markets that I can point to is this focus on first year spread versus a focus on long-term IRR. When we are looking at a particular transaction that is inside of our historical spreads, which has been 150 basis points, we hesitate to pursue that transaction because it is not in line with what we can generate in the first year. And as you know, better than most, that we are valued off of that initial spread that we are able to capture, which then translates into AFFO per share growth. But that does not allow us to pursue transactions that have a similar, potentially even a higher total return profile given the inherent growth, et cetera, that they might have despite having a much lower initial cash cap rate. That is where we feel like being able to access private capital that has similar expectations on the long-term horizon, the return horizon that we have -- we focus on even as a standalone public entity, but not with that short-term focus, as acutely as the public entity does, will allow us to expand our sandbox and make investments alongside this private capital business, to take advantage of much higher growth rate opportunities, but potentially at a lower initial yield. So, we think of this as truly complementary to our business. Go ahead. Were you going to ask something else? Sure. Industrial is a perfect example. We've looked at opportunities in the 5.5 ZIP code. We cannot go there today, as based on where our cost of capital is, with 3% growth, 20-year leases. You do the math and you're going to have a return profile, that is very much in line with what we're looking for long term, but we can't pursue that particular transaction because of what the -- maybe not the dilution, but the non-spread day one, that's a perfect example. There are other asset types. Data centers being a perfect example of another asset type that is going to fall squarely in this bucket, which we may not be able to pursue currently given our cost of capital. And that is a particular area of the business that we believe can help drive earnings growth for the public entity in years to come. Of course, we are going to continue to be a very large equity holder in the fund. So, our interests are going to be perfectly aligned. So, there will be a lot of opportunities that we are going to be looking at, which actually works for both entities long term, but potentially in the short term does not work for the stand-alone public entity. But this is also going to be a function of the capital raising. We are not going to be buying things into the farm that we would never have touched even taking the long-term return profile into account as a public entity. So, this is truly to enhance the box and to pursuit transactions, assuming our capital raising is successful, and participate together through the fund structure. That is how we would like to deploy capital. I hope it's going to be very simple. What causes added complication. Well, it's a different pocket of capital, but unlike pockets of capital that have finite life, this is a perpetual vehicle. And we are going to be very large co-investors in this perpetual vehicle. And for all intents and purposes, it will be fully consolidated with our financial statements. So, you will have perfect visibility. The fact that we have scale and the fact that we have a platform that we are very proud of, unfortunately, does not get valued at points in time by the public markets. And this is a way for us to monetize this platform and, therefore, incur very little incremental cost to stand up this vehicle. That, too, is a value that our current platform is going to bring. And I might go so far as to say that given our size and scale, which we have talked about being such a massive advantage, this is one of the ways that we can show that to the market. And I'll just add it to that just because we're talking about credit, let me just share a bit more. I mean these are assets that we really want to one control over. And we are doing everything in our power to get control of this asset. It is essentially a client who's decided not to pay rent while operating these assets. And given the work that the asset management team has done, we already have a tremendous amount of interest in these assets, which are primarily located in Texas. And so, we feel very confident about being able to replace the rent, which is not significant in this case. The actual cash rent that is very quickly once we gain control. So that's this convenience store operator. But while we are on the topic of credit, I want to walk you through some of what has dominated the conversations over the last few quarters. Red Lobster has emerged from bankruptcy and just hired a CEO. They've hired a Chief Marketing Officer. They've got a new CFO. Let me close the storyline on that. We had 216 assets, pre-bankruptcy. Nine assets were rejected through bankruptcy. We had a 91% recapture rate on that particular name. Rite Aid. We have 29 locations today. We had an 88% recapture rate on Rite Aid, which is now emerged from bankruptcy and is an ongoing concern. Regal, where we have 35 assets today and an 85% recapture rate and it has emerged from bankruptcy. So those are the story lines that have dominated multiple quarters of conversations, and this is the end result of all of those conversations. Let's talk about Walgreens. Everybody is concerned about what used to be a 2,000 store closings, which has now been reduced to 1,500. Year-to-date, we've had 13 Walgreens come up for renewal. They had lease maturity. All 13 were renewed by Walgreens. In our history of 55 renewals with Walgreens, we've had a recapture rate of over 100%. Let's throw CVS in that mix. We've had 40 leases renew with CVS in our history at over 102% renewal. Let's talk about Family Dollar, Dollar Tree. We've had 135 lease renewals with Family Dollar, Dollar Tree in our history at over 108% renewal rate. Dollar General is a similar story. So, I just asked that what we see in the headlines don't necessarily translate to what is happening on the ground for our portfolio. And that's the emphasis I want to make is that we are very selective and the data proves that out to be the case. Go ahead, Smedes. Sorry, I cut you off. Yes. It's too early to tell. We obviously believe in our pieces. We believe in what we are doing. We believe it's -- the benefits of what we are doing is going to accrue to our public shareholders, but it is too early Smedes me to opine on how big this could potentially become. That's a great question, Jay, given what we've done in the quarters, it is a legitimate question. Yes, 56% of what we've done year-to-date has been in Europe, but we view that as an advantage that's precisely the reason why we created all of these growth verticals to be able to take advantage of wherever the best opportunities reside. And Europe is where we found that to be the case for the first three quarters. I believe the momentum in Europe will continue. We are seeing very good opportunities in Europe. And yes, our ability to go beyond our current geography, by geography, I mean, countries in Europe is also something that we are constantly looking. And so, for the right opportunity, there are several countries that we don't happen to be in that we would consider going into with the right client and with the right opportunity. Jay had asked about the future as well. And so, the $1.3 billion that's expected in the fourth quarter, I want to close a loop on that. The momentum that I had referenced was the momentum that we are seeing here in the U.S. In Europe, the momentum has continued. It's been there at the beginning of the year. That momentum has continued, but it's in the fourth quarter that you will see it reverting back to more historical norms in terms of U.S. versus international. That's a very good question, Haendel. Thank you. And you're right. I mean, the idea here is we get into this business to expand the investable universe for ourselves and for the fund while making sure that we adhere to the return expectations of all parties concerned. Look, it's a mathematical fact that it's not an issue today, but 10 years from now, at the rate we are growing, if we continue to rely on just the public markets to finance our growth, we're going to run up into capacity issues. I don't believe that the public markets are, especially the fund business in the public markets are growing at the same level that we have expectations of growing as a public entity. And so, it is not a dearth of opportunities that is driving this desire to get into the fund business. it is making sure that this complementary source of equity capital will help us monetize our platform and create a business that will then allow us to continue the momentum that we have shown over the last 55 years, 30 of which has been as a public entity. That is the goal of what we are trying to do. And outside of the initial call it, seating of this fund, which, by the way, that portfolio will look and feel very similar to what Realty income looks like. And at the appropriate time, all of that will get disclosed, is a way to attract capital and start our business. But subsequently, it will be new transactions that they participate in, either alongside us or it will be on balance sheet for the public entity. That's how the business is going to function. Yes. Haendel, I'm not going to opine on cap rates, et cetera, because things can move around quite a bit. But what I will tell you is that the spread that we are going to make will be -- will continue to be healthy and will continue to be north of our historical spreads. That you can take a fair amount of confidence. And the other piece I'll leave you with Haendel is, we have already prefunded our need for the fourth quarter. So, there is no reliance on the public markets to help fund this $1.3 billion that we are planning on doing in the fourth quarter. Hopefully, that helps. That's a great question, Spenser, because it really goes to the heart of when I say we're going to scale -- use our scale as a company that we are today to mitigate what would be an insurmountable cost for a start-up to stop this business. We have 465 people in the business. We already have a fully staffed investment arm, both here in the U.S. as well as in the U.K. and in Amsterdam, taking care of our international business. So, we don't see any need or any incremental personnel on the investment side. That's scale benefit, number 1. Scale benefit number two. We are going to be agnostic as to whether these assets are held in a fund, which, by the way, the public entity will have a fairly large interest in or whether it is on balance sheet. And thus, our asset management team that has done a superb job on the public side, both here in the U.S. as well as in the international markets in London, they will continue to manage these assets. That's benefit number two. Any dispositions, any elements of that, we already have the team here. We have a very large legal team that we are going to leverage that obviously is a massive source of pride for us given that we do a majority of the work in-house. We will continue to lean on them to help with transaction negotiations, lease negotiations, et cetera. That scale benefits, number three. We already have the setup in place -- and so we are not going to be needing new people to help do the block and tackle work that is required of an investment arm where we will have incremental cost will be around a fund manager and the reporting as well as an IR function that will be dealing with a very specific type of investor base on the private side. But outside of that, from accounting finance, which, by the way, is again something we are very proud of, will all be leveraged with the existing platform that we have. That's my comment around the incremental cost in standing this business up will be fairly muted. Yes, Spenser, it's the -- it's very fluid in terms of who we are starting to compete against. There is no doubt that private arms are becoming much bigger players in transactions that we are pursuing. And of course, we've had a few more companies in the net lease space that have become public. We don't run into most of them given the types of transactions that we pursue, but it is a crowded field in terms of competition here in the U.S. In the international market, it continues to be one of the biggest advantages that we have, where we are running into more competition today than we did, let's call it, a year or two years ago, but we -- but it's still not quite as intense as what we experienced here in the U.S. And most of that competition comes from private capital in the international market. So, that's the flavor of who we compete against in the U.S. and in the international markets. Yes. I think, Upal, so much of the volatility across the curve at this point is around what will happen today. And it's the largest exogenous factor that's going to determine where the curve settles down. We are not as exposed to the short end of the curve. We are -- but it's not to the same extent as we are to the long end of the curve. And so, what's happening on the long end of the curve definitely has an impact on our cost of capital because that becomes a permanent source of financing and our ability to pursue transactions. And that is a function of inflation expectations that people have about the future. And if policies are going to get put into place, where the inflation expectation is going to suddenly be much higher than what it had been traditionally, that is going to have an impact on where the tenure is going to settle and that will certainly have an impact either on the positive side or on the negative side for the permanent cost of capital for a net lease business. And those are largely policy driven. We've had parties coming up with proposals that have a diverse set of impacts on this particular inflation expectations. So too early to tell where all of this is going to settle. It is creating a fair amount of volatility, and we are hopeful that regardless of who wins, once we have more clarity in terms of what the curve is going to look like, we'll be able to execute on business as usual. Really, Upal, there is nothing that we are seeing either on the credit side. I think I went through a pretty detailed list to share with you that on the credit side, we feel very good. Our credit watch list actually came down by 10 basis points to 4.2%. And from the previous quarter. So, we feel very good on the credit side. We feel very good on the health of the market to precipitate transactions setting aside what's happened over the last couple of weeks, but that too shall pass is our expectation. Really, the timing is around to do this right, which obviously is our collective desire. We want to do this very slowly and we want to do it very thoughtfully and it's going to take a long time, a long time for this to become a mature business. I mean look at one of our peers who has probably one of the most successful open-ended fund businesses, and that's Prologis. And they've been in that business for 20-plus years. And today, it has become -- we can step back and say it is a super successful business that some very smart people went into 20 years ago. And so, in anticipation of what could happen 10 years from now, et cetera, when we start to run up against this, our desire to put out capital and perhaps the limits of just accessing the capital sources that we have today, that could become more acute. And so, we have to start today to build this history and to build this fun business to a point where it really starts to bear fruit for our public shareholders et cetera. And that's it. That's why we are doing it today. There is no -- there is -- it doesn't matter at which point in the cycle we would have done this, that question would and should be asked, but it's really about starting now when we don't have a need for additional capital and building this business to get ahead of what could be a limiting factor multiple years down the road. And I think we -- as Sumit alluded to earlier, the credit loss was at 4.2%. There's really not a lot out there that we're really monitoring that meaningful. There's no 1-plus percent exposure tenants on there. We feel as though those that are on the watch list, we've been monitoring for quite some time. And in some cases, we have very good visibility into the cash flow coverage on these assets. And so, we'll get into all of the assumptions that we're baking in for 2025 come February when we release our guidance. Yes. Ron, we haven't really done any work on the investor profile, but the comments I made about how much bigger this investable universe is of potential investors to look to invest in real estate through a fund structure is what's so compelling. Is it possible that you have some of these funds that have ambit to invest in public securities and they have a mandate to invest in private direct investments? I'm sure that may be the case. But even those investors will tell you that what they have to invest through a fund structure directly into real estate is multiples of what they have on the security side. So, I can't give you a more precise answer than that, but the vast majority, I believe, are going to be investors who don't have the ability to invest in public securities but would like to utilize our platform, work with us and invest in the product that we invest in. And outside of that, the strategy is one that I've already touched on. There's not going to be anything new that the fund business is going to be doing that we won't do on balance sheet. Keep in mind that the goal is we will be a massive co-investor in this fund. And so, our interests are going to be perfectly aligned in terms of what it is that we pursue. Yes. So, I won't talk about pipelines, Ronald, but what you've referenced in terms of the demand, we're seeing that in space. And we've been very lucky to be speaking with multiple operators in this space. We see it in terms of what they're showing us regarding the pipeline that they've created we are trying to craft a value proposition that is compelling to these operators. And we are very optimistic about where this particular business could go for realty income going forward. We feel like we can be a solution that helps meet some of the demand and the capital needs to execute on what is a once in a cycle type situation. And at the end of the day, we have capital allocators. And if we can allocate capital exposed to S&P 10, S&P 20 clients for 20 years, that's our core business. And so, we are excited, but it's too early to tell in terms of how this is all going to play out. R.J., what I'll share with you is you should think of these investments in terms of flow-through, rental income flowing through to NOI to be very similar to what we've done on balance sheet right? The idea is not to go and start executing on businesses that have a 40% NOI margin. That's not what we do. And so, when we talk about data centers, we are not going to be going out there and buying colocation sites where the flow-through is very different versus hyperscale single-tenant 20-year leases that may not be precisely triple net, but the flow-through is still incredibly high, i.e., mimicking what a triple net asset should be generated. That's really the -- what we are going to be doing. So, the cost of equity as defined by long-term return hurdles should be very similar, but their focus is on the long-term hurdle rate, not on day one accretion. And that's the big difference, R.J. That's why I gave the examples that I did that the return profile long term is very similar for both of these businesses. But we, as a public entity, 100% public entity, today cannot meet our dual mandate of generating that year one spread and the long-term hurdle rate. Both those have to be met in order for us to pursue transactions in the public markets today. That's how we are valued, and we are very grateful for that. We understand that that's how -- that's the game we have to play. But there are assets that we are passing up on very high-quality assets that can meet the long-term hurdle, but will potentially have a much lower starting point. And that, I think, is what we'll be able to do through this fund structure and enhance our co-investment through the recurring asset management fee stream, which is essentially the monetization of the platform that we have. to the benefit of our public shareholders. That's how this will work. There will be a seat portfolio that will allow us to have conversations with potential investors. But thereafter, it will be new investments that we pursue. That's how we're thinking about it today. So outside of that initial seed portfolio, everything else will be new transactions that we'll be pursuing. Greg, that's a very good question because when we pursue development, we do have certain accounting elements that we have to adhere to. And there are times where we are unable to recognize the full cash impact, the positive cash yield that we are able to generate on dollars that we are investing in a development scenario, just given the lease accounting that we have, that's certainly not going to be a prohibitive factor doing it through the fund structure. And so, could we do more of those? Yes. In the fund, the answer is yes. But again, it needs to meet and exceed the overall return hurdles that we would we would need to address. So, there are a lot of things that this alternative source of financing could allow us to do, which we have done as a public entity, but only in a limited way because of some of the inherent limitations that we have either in terms of how we can report stuff, et cetera. So, I do think that this will give us the flexibility and thus, the comment I made about expanding the sandbox of the types of transactions that we would be able to pursue by having this alternative source of capital available to us. We have none of that in mind. We have and I think I've talked about this, what is -- the profile of this investor would look like. We certainly have that, and we are working with our advisers who have shared with us what the details are around that, but we haven't had any conversations today. Yes, that's a great question, Wes. Look, it's a very small portion of the overall development. I think it's like 15% plus/minus in that ZIP code. And even though the quantum that we have identified for this particular type of development, we really don't spend until we get clarity on the leases coming through. And so, we feel very confident. We are partnering with one of the best developers in Panattoni, and we feel very confident that some of these are going to get leased up in the near term. And keep in mind, we won't make the big capital investment without having line of sight on potential clients being able to step in and take over those leases. Yes, absolutely. And in fact, in situations where -- we've had two buildings, one was leased and the other one wasn't. We have expectations and what we think the lease rates are going to be and -- so far, more often than not, those lease rates -- our expected lease rates have been superseded by what actually ends up happening. So, this continues to build a fair amount of confidence in not only our partners, but also our team's ability to underwrite these types of transactions. Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking soon and seeing you at a conference in the coming weeks. Thank you, guys."

            "content": "Thank you, Sumit. We are pleased to deliver over another strong quarter while increasing our investment in AFFO guidance for the year, reflecting continued momentum. Consistent with our investment strategy, we remain disciplined in our balance sheet management. Our strong balance sheet underscored by A3/A- credit ratings and deep access to capital globally continue to represent significant competitive advantages, fueling the opportunity to grow earnings through multiple channels. Our leverage, as measured by net debt to annualized pro forma adjusted EBITDA was a healthy 5.4x, well within our target ratio or 5.2x including $969 million of unsettled forward equity outstanding as of today. Our fixed charge coverage ratio of 4.6x remains in line with the 4.5 to 4.7x range. We have delivered consistently over the last seven quarters. A focus on derisking our future funding needs was a catalyst behind our two bond offerings during the third quarter, which consisted of a $500 million 30-year U.S. dollar bond offering and an effective semiannual yield to maturity of 5.49% and a dual tranche sterling bond offering that raised \u00a3700 million at a weighted average tenor of 11.1 years and a weighted average annual yield maturity of 5.4%. These offerings illustrate the diversity of debt products available to us and the intentionality of our capital diversification philosophy. Our 30-year offering was our first 30-year issuance since 2017, and our public sterling offering was our fifth non-U.S. public bond offering in approximately three years, bringing our foreign denominated outstanding unsecured debt to over $8 billion. We are grateful for the loyal support we have received from the fixed income community as we continue to expand our credit presence globally. At quarter end, we held $5.2 billion of liquidity, including unsettled forward equity, in addition to retaining almost full capacity net of cash available on our $4.25 billion revolving credit facility, only 3.4% of our outstanding debt at the end of the quarter was variable rate in nature, illustrating the financing flexibility we have heading into the end of the year. Access to capital is paramount to the success of our company and our portfolio size, scale, diversification and our trading liquidity in the public markets, have consistently afforded us well all priced capital to grow with large-scale, high-quality investment opportunities. With that said, we strive to demonstrate a proactive forward-looking mindset as we plan, position and evolve our financing strategy for future growth. Over the last few years, we have evaluated additional sources of equity capital beyond the public markets and have recently begun in earnest to build a private capital infrastructure that we believe, over time, will leverage our strengths and expand the breadth of our capital allocation opportunities globally. I would like to hand it back to Sumit to provide additional color. Sumit? First of all, I'd say we absolutely expect a fair welcome. We've talked historically about situations where we've had credit issues in the portfolio, we've recouped north of 80% of rent that's been impacted. As it relates to the accounting that drove the $64 million charge, it's noncash first and foremost, it really has to do with the fact that upon the allocation of the original purchase price. You've got land, you've got building and then you've got the intangible, which is meant to account for the future cash flows inherent in the lease. And so, the reserve that you see, which rolls into impairment, but is classified because these were originally sale leasebacks as a financing receivable. And that's really just a difference in nomenclature and that's why it's excluded from AFFO is noncash. And we've already expensively accounted for all of the lost rent for the entire of 2024 that's built into our guidance. Yes. So, Linda, if you look at the earnings release, first nine months of this year, we've incurred about $6 million in bad debt expense. That's around 40 basis points of our rental revenue. When you take out this one C-store operator that we referenced earlier. You're really looking at sub-20 basis points on 18 basis points. We've talked historically about how when you exclude the pandemic, we've been right there around 25 basis points of credit loss in a given year as a percentage of revenue. So, to be at 18 outside of these onetime unusual events, we think is pretty indicative of a very constructive and healthy portfolio. So, in terms of this one C-store operator, it's really, I call it $1 million a month or so. And all of that is built in. All of that is built into our guidance. And we'll see where we trend out to in terms of recovery. But as we referenced earlier, we do feel like there could be quite a bit of interest in these assets. So, I think the default response that we have to offer up is you look at our historical precedents and being able to get 84%, 85% or recapture of any rent that's been impacted by from bank or credit event. Yes. It's a combination of a few things. Greg, first of all, there's been some deferred expenses we brought forward, some that were carried forward from last year. We're just trying to get ahead of spend and trying to catch up in some cases. So, there is a little bit of heavier load this quarter. I would also say for this year, I would also say that there are some carry costs that we are incurring with a few vacant assets that do comprise a bit of an increase on a year-over-year basis from a margin perspective. And then also, I think when you're just comparing to the 1.1% leakage that we experienced last year, keep in mind we did bring in a $9 billion portfolio in January with the Spirit portfolio. And that did have slightly more leakage as well just on a run rate basis. So, I would really attribute it to those factors as what's driving the slight increase going from 1.1% and now to a midpoint of 1.35%."

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would like now to turn the conference over to Mr. Steve Bakke, Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance. Please go ahead.\nSteve Bakke: Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's first quarter operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jonathan Pong, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. During this conference call, we will make statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. You'll disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company's Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two-question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you would like to ask additional questions, you may reenter the queue. I will now turn the call over to our President and CEO, Sumit Roy.\nSumit Roy: Thank you, Steve. Welcome, everyone. In the second quarter, I am pleased we were able to deliver strong results of the economy as well as the transaction market, navigate today\u2019s rate environment. We see to be real estate partners to the world\u2019s leading companies and the diligent efforts of our dedicated team resulted in AFFO per share of $1.06 representing a robust 6% growth compared to last year. Combined with our annualized dividend yield in excess of 5% our shareholders owned a total operational return of over 11%. The power of our global sourcing and acquisition platform was on display this quarter as we deployed capital in the U.S. and Europe across retail, industrial and data center real estate, and the real estate-backed credit opportunities. In total, we invested $805.8 million into high-quality opportunities at a blended 7.9% initial cash yield, or an 8.2% straight-line yield, assuming CPI growth of 2%. Of this, approximately $262 million of volume was invested in the U.S. at a 7.6% initial cash yield. The balance of approximately $544 million was invested in Europe at an 8% initial cash yield, including a $377.5 million investment in a secured note at an 8.1% yield issued by Asda, a leading U.K. grocery operator. As we discussed in the past, we intend to pursue credit investments selectively, and only when it may eventually facilitate access to high-quality real estate opportunities, as has been the case with Asda. We also believe these credit investments represent a profitable means for Realty Income to participate in and benefit from the current rate environment. Furthermore, from a risk management perspective, we view these credit investments as a prudent, natural hedge to the inherent rate exposure as we have on the liability side of our balance sheet. Providing further detail on investments in the quarter, we executed 79 discrete transactions with 55 clients, including two new clients across 22 industries. 31% of direct real estate investment volume was allocated to new sale leasebacks. Touching on our sourcing activity, we were pleased that our transaction discipline earlier this year is bearing fruit. As this quarter, we began to see a greater number of opportunities available at pricing that aligns with our cost of capital. This improvement supported the $200 million increase in transaction volume sequentially, and it drove the investment guidance increase to $3 billion in June, a 50% increase from our prior guidance. We believe the higher closed volume paired with investment spreads that are largely consistent with last quarter are signs the transaction market may be moving towards normalization. Investment activity this quarter was funded in large part by adjusted free cash flow, which totaled approximately $200 million in the second quarter. Not having to rely on public equity enhanced the accretive nature of these transactions. The deployment of excess cash flow represents an important contributor to our growth. In fact, we believe we can utilize excess free cash flow together with our portfolio's internal rent growth to deliver an approximate 7% to 8% total operational return annually to shareholders without relying on public equity issuance. The portfolio's stabilized internal growth rate has risen in recent years, and now stands at approximately 1.5% on an annualized basis, in part because of the expansion of our European platform, where many leases are subject to uncapped CPI increases, as well as our expansion into the gaming and data center verticals, which where leases often include healthy annual rent escalators. With the benefit of excess free cash flow, second quarter capital deployment activity resulted in investment spread of approximately 293 basis points, which like the first quarter is well above our historical spread of 150 basis points, in part due to the utilization of excess free cash flow. As a reminder, these disclosed investment spreads utilize our short-term nominal cost of capital, which measures the estimated year one earnings dilution from raising capital on a leverage neutral basis to fund our investment volume. This is different from a higher long-term cost of capital, which applies a growth premium to our cost of equity to account for the long-term return requirements for our investors. While we remain vigilant in today's volatile environment, seeking only the most attractive risk adjusted return opportunities, we will also only utilize external capital opportunistically aiming to augment our growth rate at times when our cost of capital becomes increasingly attractive as compared to prevailing market investment yields. An additional source of capital in the second quarter was dispositions. We utilize proprietary predictive analytic tools in combination with the insights of our asset management and research teams to drive the decision to sell 75 properties for total net proceeds of approximately $106 million, bringing the year-to-date total to approximately $202 million. For the year, we expect to sell between $400 and $500 million of assets. As we continue to calibrate and hone our predictive analytic tools, advancing our investment pieces on each property in our portfolio, we may be more active on dispositions than in the past. We continue to optimize our portfolio composition and investment returns while broadening our use of organically generated capital to finance growth. Another critical point of differentiation for Realty Income is the strength of our balance sheet, underpinned by our low leverage of 838 minus credit ratings by Moody's and S&P respectively, and our access to capital on a global basis. During the second quarter of 2024, the combination of internally generated cash flow and disposition sale proceeds allowed us to fund most of our investment activity without settling any newly issued equity capital while still maintaining our leverage metrics at or below our long-term targets. Shifting to operations, our portfolio continues to generate very solid returns and to perform in a very stable fashion. Occupancy rose to 98.8% as of June 30th, a 20 basis point increase from the prior quarter. Additionally, our rent recapture rate across 199 leases was 105.7%, totaling approximately $34 million in new annualized cash rent. The size, scale, diversification, and consistency of performance from our global real estate portfolio continues to provide us with excellent visibility to revenue and is a key reason why we have not had a single year of negative operational return in our 30 years as a public company. Managing through periodic store closures is a natural part of our business model, and our top-tier credit research and asset management teams offer distinct competitive advantages, which have consistently enabled us to optimize value in these situations. To that end, we would like to provide remarks on a few clients that are currently managing through store closures or have been in the news due to credit-related concerns. Importantly, in the context of our portfolio's size and scale, the aggregate financial exposure of potential loss rent is not expected to materially impact our ability to generate the consistent operational returns our shareholders are accustomed to. And it is important to emphasize our recent increase in earnings guidance takes all credit considerations into account. Rite Aid, which represents 30 basis points of our total portfolio analyzed contractual rent as of June 30, 2024, is expected to emerge from bankruptcy in the third quarter. Through the remainder of the bankruptcy process, we expect to lose 12 basis points of rent prior to the resolution of assets vacated in the proceedings, which are ultimately released or sold. Red Lobster represents 1% of our total portfolio annualized contractual rents and it is currently moving through the bankruptcy process. At present, as publicly stated, Red Lobster is targeting to emerge from bankruptcy in the third quarter of 2024. We continue to believe that our visibility into rent coverage and our master lease structure across most of our properties mitigate some of our potential risk. And while not finalized, we currently believe our recapture rate will be roughly in line with our historical portfolio-wide average of 84% for client bankruptcy restructurings. Walgreens is considered closing certain stores. Looking out over the next two and a half years, we have leases representing only 26 basis points of our total portfolio annualized contractual rent that will expire over that time. Outside of a bankruptcy strategy, which we view as unlikely with Walgreens, these are the only stores Walgreens can legally seize contractual rent payments on once each lease expires. To provide context on historical capture rates in the drugstore industry, we have managed 166 lease expirations since 2013. 80% of these were renewed. That resulted in a blended recapture rate in excess of 100% of prior rent. Dollar Tree, which is investment-grade rated, announced the potential split of their Family Dollar brand from Dollar Tree. If this were to result in store closings, Family Dollar leases representing only five basis points of our total portfolio annualized contractual rent are set to expire between now and year-end 2026. And of course, in the interim, they are obligated to continue paying rent through lease expiration. Our historical recapture results in the dollar store industries have been similarly favorable. We have managed 263 lease expirations since 2013, of which 86% of the clients renewed at a weighted average rate well north of 105%. In case of our tier 1.5% of exposure, we feel the risks have notably diminished in the past 12 months. Cineworld reduced its debt by $4.5 billion through its restructuring, and AMC recently made improvements to its financial position by extending debt maturities and additional equity issues. It is important to note that in total, the rent at risk from Rite Aid, Red Lobster, Walgreens, Dollar Tree, as well as At Home and Big Lots, which is 11 basis points of rent, represents in total only 2.3% of our total portfolio annualized contractual rent through year-end 2026. And if we achieve the recapture rate in line with our long-term average for bankruptcies, which is 84%, this suggests only approximately 37 basis points of rent is at risk of ceasing, or an approximately $0.02 of AFO per share impact. In addition, if they do take place, advance notice of potential store closures are of incremental value to us because they provide years, in many instances, to plan the optimal outcome at those locations where the client's plan is to leave while we continue to be paid rent. This $0.02 per share potential impact is manageable and is counterbalanced by the power and stability of our net lease business model, which is underpinned by diversification across more than 15,000 properties, 1,500 clients, and 8 countries on 2 continents. Hence, we believe it is important to separate the store closing headlines from the manageable impact they have on our financials. With that, I would like to turn it over to Jonathan to discuss our second quarter financial results in more detail. Jonathan?\nJonathan Pong: Thank you, Sumit. Consistency has long been a benchmark by which we manage our business. To that end, we ended the second quarter with leverage at 5.3 times without settling any ATM equity during the quarter. This was the 25th consecutive quarter of leverage at 5.5 times or lower, reflecting our commitment to our A3, A- credit ratings, which we have had now since 2018. As a reminder, we manage our leverage through the lens of net debt and preferred equity to annualize pro forma adjusted EBITDA. During the second quarter, we generated approximately $200 million of adjusted free cash flow, over $100 million in real estate sales proceeds, and approximately $185 million of forward unsettled equity sold through the ATM. After modest ATM issuance activity subsequent to quarter end, we currently have almost $450 million of unsettled forward equity, which we estimate will be more than sufficient to finance our equity needs for the remainder of 2024 and still remain within our target leverage ratios. Our balance sheet remains healthy with a well-staggered debt maturity schedule that allows us to be active should borrowing costs trend lower over the maturity cycle. Last month, we repaid $350 million of maturing public notes, leaving us with only $118 million of maturing mortgage debt for the balance of the year. Our exposure to variable [ph] rate debt of $1.6 billion remains modest at only 6.3% of total debt principal at quarter end, and our liquidity remains solid with access to approximately $3.8 billion of capital. At the end of the second quarter, inclusive of cash on hand, availability under our $4.25 billion revolving credit facility and our outstanding ATM forward equity. We remain comfortable with the liability side of the balance sheet and believe we are well positioned to act on larger investment opportunities should they present themselves. As Sumit mentioned earlier, we view our credit investments as a natural hedge to the inherent interest rate risk associated with debt maturities we have on our balance sheet. That end, the six year \u00a3300 million sterling senior secure loan we invested in during the quarter provides us with an attractive 8.1% yield secured by the solid credit of a U.K. grocery store operator, while reducing the rate sensitivity on the value of sterling debt we have on the balance sheet maturing in 2030, which currently totals \u00a3540 million. From a 2024 earnings guidance perspective, we are reiterating our full year investments at $3 billion in our AFFO per share guidance of $4.15 to $4.21, which represents 4.5% annual per share growth, assuming the midpoint. As a reminder, we increased our guidance on June 4, which included the expectation of collecting the $16 million of lease termination fees that we recognized in the second quarter. Offsetting a portion of AFFO tailwinds with termination fees was the recognition of approximately $6.2 million of AR reserves from one of our clients in the convenience store industry. Lease termination fees are excluded and are same-store rental revenue calculations, while AR reserves are included. Thus, the $6.2 million of reserves that we recognized on one client in the quarter alongside impacts by theatre portfolio held back our second quarter same-store rent growth by approximately 60 basis points, resulting in overall same-store growth of 0.2% for the quarter. Including this reserve, we continue to expect our full-year same-store rental revenue growth recovered to close to the 1% level for 2024. With that, I would like to hand the call back to Sumit for closing remarks.\nSumit Roy: Thank you, Jonathan. To conclude our prepared remarks, the year is progressing largely in line with expectations, perhaps even slightly ahead. There are signs the transaction market is beginning to normalize as we find more opportunities to deploy capital into high-quality investments, meeting our minimum return requirements. Adjusted free cash flow and dispositions continue to be accretive sources of capital we can use to support future growth. Combined with the stability of our solidly performing client base and the strength of our balance sheet, we believe we are well positioned to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns to shareholders in a variety of economic environments. I'd like to now open it up for questions. Operator?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Michael Goldsmith from UBS. Please go ahead.\nMichael Goldsmith: Good afternoon. Thanks a lot for taking my question. The largest component of your investment volume this quarter was the investment in the Asda notes. How should we think about the different investment buckets that you have when it comes to expectations for the back half of the year? Thanks.\nSumit Roy: Thank you, Michael. That's correct. We did have a $377 million investment in the Asda loan, which was very opportunistic. We've already highlighted the reasons as to why we did that. What you should expect for the balance of the year, for the remaining half of the year, is that we are probably going to have the majority of our investments, if not 100% of our investments in our more traditional investment asset level, portfolio level, real estate direct investment. That's what's going to make up the balance of the remaining six months.\nMichael Goldsmith: Got it. Then as a follow-up, can you talk a little bit about the opportunities you're seeing in the U.S. versus European markets? Outside the loan, you leaned a little bit more to the U.S. in the second quarter or a reversal from the first quarter. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in these markets and the spreads in the U.S. versus Europe? Thanks.\nSumit Roy: Yes. During the first quarter, we had said that we're starting to see some green shoots here in the U.S. where sellers were starting to realize the higher cap rate environment was here to stay. That obviously resulted in an increase in volume in terms of investments here in the U.S. in the second quarter. We expect that to continue into the remainder of the year. The volume increase that we saw with regards to sourcing would also attest to that phenomena. I think with the backdrop that we are seeing on the cost of capital side, I do think that there will be more transactions that will materialize in the next half, especially here in the U.S. The markets in Europe have been fairly stable. I think the expectations of the interest rate cuts were well understood. What we saw in the first quarter where we had some opportunistic sellers come to the market and be with the beneficiaries of those transactions. Similar transactions took place in the second quarter. And we feel pretty confident that, that trend will continue for the remainder of the year. But you should see an increase in volume coming from the U.S. and more of the same in markets outside the U.S.\nOperator: The next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Yes hey guys. Maybe just going back to the Asda loan. I think you've done some other loans in the past that were pretty sizable. Just kind of how do you think about like the duration risk and just like when you're typically taking the equity stake and doing a real estate loan, it's like you'd assume that real estate forever, but for a loan, it's kind of limited duration. Like how does that factor into your underwriting? Just like is there a limit maybe on exposure you want to have for lending?\nSumit Roy: Yes. So Joshua, we've been very clear with the market that the credit investment side of the business is an addendum to what we are offering our clients. We believe that opportunistically, it makes a lot of sense for us to continue to be a partner to our clients, such as Asda. And when you look at the investment we made, $377 million at an 8.1% 6-year paper [ph] and you overlay the fact that we have maturing debt close to \u00a3600 million coming due in about the same time frame, this is one of the reasons why we did what we did. Let me put this in perspective in a slightly different way. If we were to go out and try to do a sale leaseback on Asda real estate today, it would probably be in the mid-6s, maybe even in the slightly inside of that. And so for the same credit, if you're able to get 160, 170 basis points of additional spread over a 6-year period. I think it's -- and get the same exposure in terms of the credit. It's something that for us made a lot of sense. The other reason is one that we've continued to share with the market around why we have gone down this path of credit investments. We've always felt like, okay, we want to be long-term partners to some of our clients. We are willing to do 20-year paper sale leasebacks on their real estate. We are along the credit. We like the credit and if we can continue to create an even closer relationship by participating, higher up on the capital stack, that is something that makes a lot of sense for us. Especially when you take it in the context stuff, we are experiencing the negative impact of higher interest rate environment on our own balance sheet. And if we can offset using this credit investment as a tool, this negative impact that we experienced by participating on the asset side by providing credit to some of our clients then this is a very nice way to hedge this negative impact. Having said all of this, we've also been very clear that credit investment is going to be a point in time. This is not a tool that will work in every environment, and we don't expect to do credit investments in a very low interest rate environment. And so for all of the reasons that I've just enumerated, it's a wonderful tool to have. And thankfully, we have the relationships with clients who want us to participate, we would like to participate and it acts as a natural hedge to some of the negative headwinds that we encounter in this environment. So that's why we did what we did.\nJoshua Dennerlein: Okay. And then maybe just one other question. Just you mentioned the expansion into data centers and gaming. It helps drive internal growth by going into those verticals. I guess are there any other verticals you're looking at or where you think you can get that higher internal growth rate if you're already in that vertical?\nSumit Roy: Yes. So the areas that give us that higher internal growth largely are the two you've mentioned and the international market. And obviously, this is not a new vertical for us, but industrial does tend to have higher internal growth as well. And the combination of our investments in these areas have resulted in the profile of internal growth changing from circa 1% in our business to 1.5%. And that will continue to be the areas that we focus in, in the future. I think this was a question that was asked in the previous call as well. Are there any new verticals that we are looking at? And the answer is no. We have a very well-defined total addressable market based on the verticals that we've already articulated to the market, and we are very comfortable continuing to play in those specified verticals. And there's plenty to be done. So we're very happy with that.\nOperator: The next question comes from John Kilichowski from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nJohn Kilichowski: Hi, thank you. So the amount of IG tenants as a percentage of acquisitions was 10%, which I believe is lower since the third quarter of 2017. Maybe how should we think about that and your appetite to move down the risk curve to generate yields here?\nSumit Roy: Yes. I don't necessarily agree with the last comment that you made in your question that John. But I'll go ahead and answer this question around investment grade representing 10% of our investments in the second quarter. We've always been very clear with the market when we've said that we don't target investment grade as a criteria for investment. What we are looking for is are we generating the right yield for the credit risk that we are taking for the real estate risk that we are taking, etcetera. And the actual ratings of the client is a byproduct of being able to underwrite appropriate risk-adjusted return profile. And if it so happens that we have clients that are investment grade as a result of that risk-adjusted profile that we are targeting. That's great. But it's not something we specifically look for. Case in point, John, if you look at our portfolio today, there are so many names in our top 20. That just happened to be non-rated. And have they gone through a rating process, they would be investment-grade. Companies like Sainsbury's, Treasury Wine Estate, we have grocers like Public and Trader Joe's that are not rated today and don't constitute an investment-grade bucket for us, but if they were to be rated, they would be. And so the point I'm trying to make is it's not something that we target. It's a byproduct of our underwriting, and we are very comfortable continuing down that path.\nJohn Kilichowski: Understood. And then I guess maybe jumping to bad debt here. On the last call, you mentioned the conservative nature of your bad debt number. I don't believe you provided it, but maybe could you talk about where it is today and if there's upside to your guide here?\nJonathan Pong: Yes. So if you just look at what we disclosed in the footnotes of the income statement on the earnings press release or the supplement, you'll see that we've recognized around $9 million on a year-to-date basis in bad debt expense. And so looking at that as a percentage of revenue, it is around 70 basis points or so. Now what we've always said is that historically, we've been roughly in the 35 basis point range as a percentage of revenue is the bad debt expense. And when you strip out the pandemic, it's closer to 23 basis points. So we're a little bit ahead of that, but a lot of that was related to this $6 million reserve that we did and uptaking on 1 C-store operator, we do not expect the magnitude of that to carry forward into the back half of the year. But there is still a little bit of conservatism there. And I think from our standpoint, even though we feel very good about a lot of these credits. I think in the back half of the year, you can assume that we're assuming something close to what we recognized in the first half.\nOperator: The next question comes from Haendel St. Juste from Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nHaendel St. Juste: Hey, I guess first question, just a follow-up on the Asda loan. I guess, are there any purchase options or agreements attached to the loans? And I guess I'm assuming these are assets you wouldn't mind owning at some point. And then as part of that, I guess I just want to confirm, based on your comments in the call that we should not anticipate you doing more loan deals in the second half of the year, that there's nothing else from that type of activity embedded in the guide? Thanks.\nSumit Roy: So Haendel, yes, the last comment you made is accurate. We are not anticipating doing any credit investments in the second half but just to be very clear, credit investments is something that we have used opportunistically in the past, and we will continue to use opportunistically going forward. But it is not contemplated that we will do any in the second half. Having said that, you're right, this is a secured bond offering. And so it is the security that we have is obviously a lot of the unencumbered real estate that as continues to own. You're also correct in assuming that we are very comfortable going along the credit. You might recall in the third quarter of last year. We did a fairly large -- I want to say, norther $600 million of sale leaseback with Asda. So this is a credit that we are very comfortable with. We like the operators. We like what they're trying to do with their business. And this is a way for us to continue to strengthen that relationship going forward. But yes, part of what we are trying to do is in the event they decide to go down the path of doing sales leasebacks, we're going to be first in line. There are no guarantees, but we will be first in line for those conversations. And that's exactly the type of position we would like to be in going forward with clients such as this.\nHaendel St. Juste: Got it. Got it. Helpful. And one more, if I may. I was intrigued by your comments on the investing landscape today. It sounds like you're seeing more opportunities to fit your buyback given your improved cost of capital and that seems like you're willing to be more active if the right opportunities present themselves. But I guess I'm curious if the lower cost of debt and just improving cost of capital more broadly is perhaps allowing some private competition to rent to the space. So I'm curious if you're seeing any incrementally new competitors or private equity reentering the landscape here? Thank you.\nSumit Roy: Sure. Good question, Haendel. Look, I think it's a little too early, but the reality is that in the event that interest rates do start to come down, private equity that has largely been absent from the market should start to come back in. We are not currently seeing that in the transaction that we are pursuing. We are seeing some institutional capital, I wouldn't call them private equity coming into the market and becoming a bit more aggressive. But it's not prevalent yet. But yes, if the interest rate environment continues to be positive, i.e., rate cuts start to materialize, finding private equity as a competitor is certainly something that we should expect. You talked about us becoming more aggressive given our cost of capital having improved, especially over the last couple of weeks. That is true. And our cost of capital has improved. But the point I want to keep making, Haendel, is we want to remain very disciplined. We do believe that there will be more transactions that should take place just given the backdrop that we've talked about. But we don't have to do a whole lot to generate the earnings guidance that we've shared with the market. And if the market opportunistically produces transaction for us, that we feel like makes a lot of sense for our portfolio, we will absolutely be first in line to take advantage of that. And that's the position that we want to be in. And -- but I don't think the fact that our cost of capital has improved, that's going to be the impetus to go out there and start doing more transactions. I think the materialization of actual transactions that we would like to be successful pursuing that is going to drive what we do in the second half. And we feel based on everything that we are seeing, plus the pipeline that we have, very confident that the investment market will continue to improve.\nOperator: The next question comes from Smedes Rose from Citi. Please go ahead.\nSmedes Rose: Hi, thanks. Just on that, I was just wondering about the transaction activity that you kind of had in your pipeline. I mean do you see more kind of larger portfolio deals in the offering? Or is it more kind of smaller kind of one-off transaction opportunities, just insert changes since your last quarterly call?\nSumit Roy: Smedes, there are some large front actions that will be coming to market in the second half. These are existing clients that we have that we are in constant conversations with as to whether we are lucky enough to win those transactions or whether they actually end up coming to market is still a bit of a question mark. But we are starting to see those types of conversations taking place, and we feel pretty good that the market is going to improve. Our pipeline is largely along the lines of what we've achieved to date on the straight up organic acquisition side. And there aren't any $1 billion portfolio. So that's what you're thinking that we have in our pipeline yet. But the conversation leads me to believe that there will be larger portfolios coming down, but we'll see.\nSmedes Rose: Okay. And then I just wanted to ask you, too, I'm sorry if you maybe address this, but the termination fees you received in the quarter, they were related to one particular client or with a bunch of fees that happen to cut it at once. So just kind of wondering what they were related to?\nJonathan Pong: Yes, Smedes those related to one particular tenant. And it's really reflective of an agreement that our team will be able to reach with them for a handful of assets, not the entire exposure, but just a handful.\nOperator: The next question comes from Greg McGinniss from Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nGreg McGinniss: Hey hope you're doing well. I was just hoping to get a little more color on how you're identifying assets for disposition, whether that's tenant credit, renewal risk, geography? Any color would be appreciated.\nSumit Roy: Sure, Greg. So a lot of it is very, it's opportunistic. It is an analysis, a very deep analysis that the asset management team takes on looking at assets for existing clients that may not have the right return profile that longer term because the markets have changed, or that particular location is not what it used to be. There could be several reasons as to why they get into the disposition list, one of which could be credit as well. And so we are using our predictive analytic tools to help monitor these 15,000 assets that we have at any given point in time and it's coming out with a rating that then suggests that, hey, this one may have a high location risk or low fungibility available to these locations. And then we overlay the credit on top of that. And then asset management goes through those and tries to create various different areas of what is the economic outcome going to look like under , for instance, a client that may not have any credit issues will pay rent. But at the end, this asset may not have other alternatives available to it outside of a vacant sale. And that return profile will be compared with selling it today to see what yields a better outcome. And that's the analysis that the asset management team is undertaking far more directly today than I think we've done in the past and that's the reason why we've come up with the $400 million to $500 million of assets that we feel like does not necessarily have a long-term future in our portfolio. And that's how we come up with the list.\nGreg McGinniss: Okay, thank you. And then on acquisitions, how should we be thinking about your view on investment spread with the improved cost of capital versus what you're actually seeing in the market. The U.S. cap rates were up 70 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Is that kind of a fair target area? Or could we see that start to come back in?\nSumit Roy: Greg, as you know, I think I don't see the cap rates moving out from these levels. And in fact, they probably are going to start to come in going forward just given the backdrop that we are all experiencing with better cost of capital, more competitors are going to start to come in. It's going to put pressure on the cap rates. So, but in terms of spread, which is how we think of our business, we are very hopeful of maintaining the spreads that we've achieved thus far. And it could be a combination of our improving cost of capital despite perhaps a slightly lower cap rate environment. But we are going to be very selective in what it is that we pursue, which is why we have not gone out and increased our acquisition guidance. But let's wait and see what happens over the next couple of months. Things are fairly volatile with elections coming up later this year. And obviously, we see what's happening on the geopolitical side. So it is a bit of a volatile period. But having filtered all of that, I think you should expect to see us trying to maintain the spreads that we've achieved thus far.\nOperator: The next question comes from Upal Rana from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nUpal Rana: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Sumit you touched on dispositions already, but I wanted to get your reasoning on providing guidance at this point? And is this a product of better visibility or a shift in strategy you did mention that you do impact -- expect to be more active on that front than the past. So you have sold a number of vacant properties already this year, but you still have another 185 more to go. So I want to get any color on that, that would be helpful.\nSumit Roy: Yes. Good question, Upal. You should expect at the end of it all, half of it to be occupied assets and half of it to be vacant assets. So clearly, the trend for the first half has been more vacant asset sales. So that's going to shift going forward. It is a slight shift in our strategy, but not if it is driven by two very large M&A deals that we've effectuated over the last 2.5 years. And clearly, and we've been very upfront about this. There are assets that we've inherited that it's not a long-term strategic hold for us. And so we just want to be more proactive in being able to dispose of these assets. And given the quantum of capital that this particular process can generate for i.e., $400 million to $500 million, we wanted to be very clear with the market that look, this is going to be a source of capital for us that you may or may not be aware of. And so people can appropriately underwrite that source of capital. And when we make statements like we don't have to be out in the equity market, this helps explain that piece. But the strategic rationale is always are constant vigilance on what is it that our portfolio looks like? Where has our strategic shifts occurred given everything that we are seeing and being a lot more proactive on the disposition side than we had traditionally been.\nUpal Rana: Okay. Great. That was helpful. And then you mentioned in your prepared remarks about the transaction market moving towards normalization. What did you mean by that? Did you mean in terms of volume, cap rates investment spreads, seller sentiment, competition? Maybe if you can give more any detail on that, that would be helpful.\nSumit Roy: Sure. So obviously, a lot of sellers were on the sideline hoping for cap rates to move, we've always talked about the cost of capital is a mark-to-market variable that's essentially getting marked every second but cap rates tend to be stickier. And when the cost of capital changed as abruptly as it did for a lot of the REIT sector, the sellers were not able to accept that environment. And so they were waiting on the sidelines, expecting things to change, but sellers can't wait indefinitely. And we've seen that phenomenon play out in the international markets more so than here. And so when that happens, sellers start to creep back into the market after a period of time. And the added element that's taking place is there's a little bit more clarity today, and I say that and I smile as to where the interest rates are going to go, and so obviously, the cost of capital side of the equation has changed for a lot of the REITs. And so this is going to allow them to transact on transactions on assets that they would have looked at doing had their cost of capital being better. And so I think it's a movement on the buyer side. It's going to be a movement on the seller side. And that's what I mean that this should facilitate more transactions in the second half than it has in the first half.\nOperator: The next question comes from Linda Tsai from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nLinda Tsai: Yes, hi. The 1% of same-store revenue growth you're achieving this year. What does it look like for next year if your portfolio stabilized internal growth rate is 1.5% on an annualized basis?\nJonathan Pong: Yes. So Linda, first of all, there's some moving pieces with this year's guidance of approximately 1% on same-store. It's a difficult year-over-year comp because we did have some reserve reversals and deferment payments that we realized last year. Last year, we had 1.9% was our same-store number. This year at 2%, you're kind of averaging -- this year at 1%, excuse me, you're kind of averaging outside 1.5 or so level. And so next year, there should be an easing of the difficult comps, but what we've always been framing for investors, especially more recently is that we are around 1.5% on a contractual rent basis, growth basis. And we would expect that to continue next year and beyond.\nLinda Tsai: Thanks. And then assuming an 84% recapture rate through year-end 2016, you only have 37 bps or $0.02 of AFFO per share impact at risk. Could that mean that your bad debt outlook in 2025 is stable or even less than what we saw this year?\nSumit Roy: Linda, the way to think about bad debt is we start the year expecting a certain percentage of bad debt expense. And in certain years, we either meet bills in a lot of years, we beat them. And in certain other years like the pandemic year, it goes beyond what we had originally gone into the year with. I think this is one of those -- like last year, for instance, we had positive outcomes on what our initial expectation was, which was, I think, 40, 50 basis points of rent. And all of last year, we not only did not have any bad debt expense, we actually ended up collecting on rents that we had on cash accounting. So that was a positive outcome. This year, this seems to be trending more in line with what we had anticipated at the beginning of the year. And there is some potential upside, but we are not -- we've still got five months left, and we'll see how things play out. But traditionally, it's been right around that 23% absent the pandemic year. And inclusive of the pandemic year, it's been right around 37%, 37 basis points, sorry, 37 basis points of rent that has basically been bad debt expense. So do we expect 2025 to be similar, yes? But we generally don't talk about years well in advance, which is why I'm pointing to what historically has happened at Realty Income.\nOperator: The next question comes from Alex Fagan [ph] from Baird. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Kind of to go back to the C-store client, that litigation. Do you have that space back? And is there already a replacement tenant for that asset?\nSumit Roy: We don't, Alex, which is why we are in litigation and which is where the upside comes from. So we've essentially that this year is going to be a resolution year. Once we get those assets back, we are very confident in our ability to find alternative clients in the C-store space for those particular locations. So that's where the upside is. And no, we are not expecting to resolve any of that this year.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe for Jonathan. What are you thinking about future debt issuances, what currency is currently most attractive? And at what rate can you issue that?\nJonathan Pong: Yes, look, so if we were to sit here today and guess what indicative is might be on 10-year unsecured paper, you're probably looking at the very low 5s, call it, 5.1, 5.2 for U.S. dollar and sterling and then you're probably looking at very low 4s, about 100 basis points tighter in the Eurozone. So we always want to have a level of flexibility, I think when you look at how far wide sterling has traded relative to the dollar over the last few years and now that it's back to parity, we have been leaning more towards the dollar side over the last few years, and the optionality is there for us because we do have the currency net investment hedge capacity to be active in the sterling market. But obviously, the more euro deals that we do and transact on the greater the ability for us to access 4% paper will be. So these are the kind of things that we think about on a daily basis. A lot of it depends on the currency of the assets that we're bringing on the books. But we're glad that we left quite a bit of capacity in these currencies that are starting to trade at parity or even inside of it relative to a dollar.\nOperator: The next question comes from Spenser Allaway from Green Street Advisors. Please go ahead.\nSpenser Allaway: Maybe just one going back to the transaction market. Can you just comment on where you're seeing the largest bid-ask spreads either across property types or industries?\nSumit Roy: For the first half of the year spent it was here in the U.S. That's the reason why our volumes were much lower than what was -- that's what was traditionally seen in what we've done. I think that's starting to compress that bid-ask spread, which is the reason why we feel pretty confident that the markets here in the U.S. is going to start to materialize favorably for us. And yes, so that's what we see.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ronald Kamdem from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRonald Kamdem: Hey just two quick ones for me. Just one, just on the interest cost. Can you remind us how much of the guidance this year, the FFO growth, how much of it was a drag just from higher interest expense and so forth? And how are you thinking about sort of the maturities in 2025?\nJonathan Pong: Yes. So definitely it wasn't much of a drag this year. I mean luckily, for us, we came out and did a debt offering in January and that was in the very low 5s, just above 5. So when you look at it on a year-over-year basis, not a big difference. We did obviously have a $350 million bond that we did repay. So there's a little bit of dilution from that. But I think when you look into 2025, we've got $1.8 billion, $1.9 billion, a 4.2% I just talked about how maybe there's 100 basis points of dilution if we were to do something like sterling and dollars based off of today's indicative rates that would have no more than about a 50 basis point impact to earnings. So it's obviously come in quite a bit. But obviously, if we have something from a euro standpoint that we can take advantage of that it will be breakeven for 2025 for short-term borrowings. Yes, it has been a little bit more dilutive because we peaked with the Fed funds rate this year. But I think much better than it was last year where that was close to 2% of growth that was held back solely because of that.\nRonald Kamdem: Great. And then my second question was just on the new growth verticals specifically, just double clicking on sort of data centers and sort of gaming. Obviously, you've done two great deals with two great partners. But just wondering as you're thinking about sort of the future deals opportunity, is there sort of any bless and learns any way that you want to structure it differently maybe that you're thinking about as the opportunity gotten more attractive, less attractive? Just trying to get a sense of where we are 12, 24 months into this process? Thanks.\nSumit Roy: Thanks, Ronald. So on the gaming side, just based on performance of the assets that we have visibility into -- it's clearly been a great investment for us. Both the assets that we currently either own 100% or partially owned have continued to perform, and we -- then the leases that were structured were, in our view, very favorable leases. It was a fair lease both to the operator and to us. And I'm not sure if there's anything there that we would change based on what we've learned over the last two years. On the data center side, we've only got one investment that has now come online. And we are very excited about continuing to work with our partner, our existing partner and some new partners that we are trying to cultivate within this space. Like I've said, the hyperscale business with enterprise clients, it's a massive business and one that I don't think any single or even three, four sources of capital can solve. And we believe that this is a total addressable market that has a place for somebody like us partnering with the right developers, operators to create our own portfolio that grows from where we are today. And I don't need to go into the thesis as to the why, but it's fairly new for us to really reflect on lessons learned. We are still trying to build that particular pipeline up. And in time, I'm sure we will share lessons learned. But one of the things that we are very focused on, and this is not necessarily based on our own history, but the history of this particular sector is to make sure that the rents that we are underwriting to day one are rents that can be supported come to renewal time, even 10, 15 years out. And I think that was one of the lessons that this particular sector had to learn the hard way when they went through renewals and they were taking write-downs in space. But outside of that, make sure that things that can become obsolete are investments that we would want the operator to make. And we stay as close and as true to the real estate as we possibly can. That's really the lens through which we are looking at the data center space.\nOperator: We have a follow-up question from Linda Tsai from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nLinda Tsai: Hi, thanks for taking my follow up. Just on the 84% recapture rate. How much does that number move around any given year? And could that actually go down next year if you have a longer run rate for knowing when those closures are going to happen?\nSumit Roy: No. The 84% is our historical average through the bankruptcy process. So any client that goes through a Chapter 11 process and if you compare the emerging rent to the pre-bankruptcy rent, that recapture rate is 84%. And Linda, if you look at the amplitude within that 84%, if you actually look at individuals, we've had situations where we've collected 70% or 65% of the rent. And then there have been situations where we've collected 100% of the rent pre-bankruptcy versus post-bankruptcy. So there is variance around this 84%, but that has historically been what we've achieved. And that's the number that we are sharing with the market.\nLinda Tsai: Thanks.\nSumit Roy: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Sumit Roy for closing remarks.\nSumit Roy: Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking soon and seeing you at conferences in the coming months.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Sumit Roy",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve. Welcome, everyone. In the second quarter, I am pleased we were able to deliver strong results of the economy as well as the transaction market, navigate today's rate environment. We see to be real estate partners to the world's leading companies and the diligent efforts of our dedicated team resulted in AFFO per share of $1.06 representing a robust 6% growth compared to last year. Combined with our annualized dividend yield in excess of 5% our shareholders owned a total operational return of over 11%. The power of our global sourcing and acquisition platform was on display this quarter as we deployed capital in the U.S. and Europe across retail, industrial and data center real estate, and the real estate-backed credit opportunities. In total, we invested $805.8 million into high-quality opportunities at a blended 7.9% initial cash yield, or an 8.2% straight-line yield, assuming CPI growth of 2%. Of this, approximately $262 million of volume was invested in the U.S. at a 7.6% initial cash yield. The balance of approximately $544 million was invested in Europe at an 8% initial cash yield, including a $377.5 million investment in a secured note at an 8.1% yield issued by Asda, a leading U.K. grocery operator. As we discussed in the past, we intend to pursue credit investments selectively, and only when it may eventually facilitate access to high-quality real estate opportunities, as has been the case with Asda. We also believe these credit investments represent a profitable means for Realty Income to participate in and benefit from the current rate environment. Furthermore, from a risk management perspective, we view these credit investments as a prudent, natural hedge to the inherent rate exposure as we have on the liability side of our balance sheet. Providing further detail on investments in the quarter, we executed 79 discrete transactions with 55 clients, including two new clients across 22 industries. 31% of direct real estate investment volume was allocated to new sale leasebacks. Touching on our sourcing activity, we were pleased that our transaction discipline earlier this year is bearing fruit. As this quarter, we began to see a greater number of opportunities available at pricing that aligns with our cost of capital. This improvement supported the $200 million increase in transaction volume sequentially, and it drove the investment guidance increase to $3 billion in June, a 50% increase from our prior guidance. We believe the higher closed volume paired with investment spreads that are largely consistent with last quarter are signs the transaction market may be moving towards normalization. Investment activity this quarter was funded in large part by adjusted free cash flow, which totaled approximately $200 million in the second quarter. Not having to rely on public equity enhanced the accretive nature of these transactions. The deployment of excess cash flow represents an important contributor to our growth. In fact, we believe we can utilize excess free cash flow together with our portfolio's internal rent growth to deliver an approximate 7% to 8% total operational return annually to shareholders without relying on public equity issuance. The portfolio's stabilized internal growth rate has risen in recent years, and now stands at approximately 1.5% on an annualized basis, in part because of the expansion of our European platform, where many leases are subject to uncapped CPI increases, as well as our expansion into the gaming and data center verticals, which where leases often include healthy annual rent escalators. With the benefit of excess free cash flow, second quarter capital deployment activity resulted in investment spread of approximately 293 basis points, which like the first quarter is well above our historical spread of 150 basis points, in part due to the utilization of excess free cash flow. As a reminder, these disclosed investment spreads utilize our short-term nominal cost of capital, which measures the estimated year one earnings dilution from raising capital on a leverage neutral basis to fund our investment volume. This is different from a higher long-term cost of capital, which applies a growth premium to our cost of equity to account for the long-term return requirements for our investors. While we remain vigilant in today's volatile environment, seeking only the most attractive risk adjusted return opportunities, we will also only utilize external capital opportunistically aiming to augment our growth rate at times when our cost of capital becomes increasingly attractive as compared to prevailing market investment yields. An additional source of capital in the second quarter was dispositions. We utilize proprietary predictive analytic tools in combination with the insights of our asset management and research teams to drive the decision to sell 75 properties for total net proceeds of approximately $106 million, bringing the year-to-date total to approximately $202 million. For the year, we expect to sell between $400 and $500 million of assets. As we continue to calibrate and hone our predictive analytic tools, advancing our investment pieces on each property in our portfolio, we may be more active on dispositions than in the past. We continue to optimize our portfolio composition and investment returns while broadening our use of organically generated capital to finance growth. Another critical point of differentiation for Realty Income is the strength of our balance sheet, underpinned by our low leverage of 838 minus credit ratings by Moody's and S&P respectively, and our access to capital on a global basis. During the second quarter of 2024, the combination of internally generated cash flow and disposition sale proceeds allowed us to fund most of our investment activity without settling any newly issued equity capital while still maintaining our leverage metrics at or below our long-term targets. Shifting to operations, our portfolio continues to generate very solid returns and to perform in a very stable fashion. Occupancy rose to 98.8% as of June 30th, a 20 basis point increase from the prior quarter. Additionally, our rent recapture rate across 199 leases was 105.7%, totaling approximately $34 million in new annualized cash rent. The size, scale, diversification, and consistency of performance from our global real estate portfolio continues to provide us with excellent visibility to revenue and is a key reason why we have not had a single year of negative operational return in our 30 years as a public company. Managing through periodic store closures is a natural part of our business model, and our top-tier credit research and asset management teams offer distinct competitive advantages, which have consistently enabled us to optimize value in these situations. To that end, we would like to provide remarks on a few clients that are currently managing through store closures or have been in the news due to credit-related concerns. Importantly, in the context of our portfolio's size and scale, the aggregate financial exposure of potential loss rent is not expected to materially impact our ability to generate the consistent operational returns our shareholders are accustomed to. And it is important to emphasize our recent increase in earnings guidance takes all credit considerations into account. Rite Aid, which represents 30 basis points of our total portfolio analyzed contractual rent as of June 30, 2024, is expected to emerge from bankruptcy in the third quarter. Through the remainder of the bankruptcy process, we expect to lose 12 basis points of rent prior to the resolution of assets vacated in the proceedings, which are ultimately released or sold. Red Lobster represents 1% of our total portfolio annualized contractual rents and it is currently moving through the bankruptcy process. At present, as publicly stated, Red Lobster is targeting to emerge from bankruptcy in the third quarter of 2024. We continue to believe that our visibility into rent coverage and our master lease structure across most of our properties mitigate some of our potential risk. And while not finalized, we currently believe our recapture rate will be roughly in line with our historical portfolio-wide average of 84% for client bankruptcy restructurings. Walgreens is considered closing certain stores. Looking out over the next two and a half years, we have leases representing only 26 basis points of our total portfolio annualized contractual rent that will expire over that time. Outside of a bankruptcy strategy, which we view as unlikely with Walgreens, these are the only stores Walgreens can legally seize contractual rent payments on once each lease expires. To provide context on historical capture rates in the drugstore industry, we have managed 166 lease expirations since 2013. 80% of these were renewed. That resulted in a blended recapture rate in excess of 100% of prior rent. Dollar Tree, which is investment-grade rated, announced the potential split of their Family Dollar brand from Dollar Tree. If this were to result in store closings, Family Dollar leases representing only five basis points of our total portfolio annualized contractual rent are set to expire between now and year-end 2026. And of course, in the interim, they are obligated to continue paying rent through lease expiration. Our historical recapture results in the dollar store industries have been similarly favorable. We have managed 263 lease expirations since 2013, of which 86% of the clients renewed at a weighted average rate well north of 105%. In case of our tier 1.5% of exposure, we feel the risks have notably diminished in the past 12 months. Cineworld reduced its debt by $4.5 billion through its restructuring, and AMC recently made improvements to its financial position by extending debt maturities and additional equity issues. It is important to note that in total, the rent at risk from Rite Aid, Red Lobster, Walgreens, Dollar Tree, as well as At Home and Big Lots, which is 11 basis points of rent, represents in total only 2.3% of our total portfolio annualized contractual rent through year-end 2026. And if we achieve the recapture rate in line with our long-term average for bankruptcies, which is 84%, this suggests only approximately 37 basis points of rent is at risk of ceasing, or an approximately $0.02 of AFO per share impact. In addition, if they do take place, advance notice of potential store closures are of incremental value to us because they provide years, in many instances, to plan the optimal outcome at those locations where the client's plan is to leave while we continue to be paid rent. This $0.02 per share potential impact is manageable and is counterbalanced by the power and stability of our net lease business model, which is underpinned by diversification across more than 15,000 properties, 1,500 clients, and 8 countries on 2 continents. Hence, we believe it is important to separate the store closing headlines from the manageable impact they have on our financials. With that, I would like to turn it over to Jonathan to discuss our second quarter financial results in more detail. Jonathan? Thank you, Jonathan. To conclude our prepared remarks, the year is progressing largely in line with expectations, perhaps even slightly ahead. There are signs the transaction market is beginning to normalize as we find more opportunities to deploy capital into high-quality investments, meeting our minimum return requirements. Adjusted free cash flow and dispositions continue to be accretive sources of capital we can use to support future growth. Combined with the stability of our solidly performing client base and the strength of our balance sheet, we believe we are well positioned to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns to shareholders in a variety of economic environments. I'd like to now open it up for questions. Operator? Thank you, Michael. That's correct. We did have a $377 million investment in the Asda loan, which was very opportunistic. We've already highlighted the reasons as to why we did that. What you should expect for the balance of the year, for the remaining half of the year, is that we are probably going to have the majority of our investments, if not 100% of our investments in our more traditional investment asset level, portfolio level, real estate direct investment. That's what's going to make up the balance of the remaining six months. Yes. During the first quarter, we had said that we're starting to see some green shoots here in the U.S. where sellers were starting to realize the higher cap rate environment was here to stay. That obviously resulted in an increase in volume in terms of investments here in the U.S. in the second quarter. We expect that to continue into the remainder of the year. The volume increase that we saw with regards to sourcing would also attest to that phenomena. I think with the backdrop that we are seeing on the cost of capital side, I do think that there will be more transactions that will materialize in the next half, especially here in the U.S. The markets in Europe have been fairly stable. I think the expectations of the interest rate cuts were well understood. What we saw in the first quarter where we had some opportunistic sellers come to the market and be with the beneficiaries of those transactions. Similar transactions took place in the second quarter. And we feel pretty confident that, that trend will continue for the remainder of the year. But you should see an increase in volume coming from the U.S. and more of the same in markets outside the U.S. Yes. So Joshua, we've been very clear with the market that the credit investment side of the business is an addendum to what we are offering our clients. We believe that opportunistically, it makes a lot of sense for us to continue to be a partner to our clients, such as Asda. And when you look at the investment we made, $377 million at an 8.1% 6-year paper [ph] and you overlay the fact that we have maturing debt close to \u00a3600 million coming due in about the same time frame, this is one of the reasons why we did what we did. Let me put this in perspective in a slightly different way. If we were to go out and try to do a sale leaseback on Asda real estate today, it would probably be in the mid-6s, maybe even in the slightly inside of that. And so for the same credit, if you're able to get 160, 170 basis points of additional spread over a 6-year period. I think it's -- and get the same exposure in terms of the credit. It's something that for us made a lot of sense. The other reason is one that we've continued to share with the market around why we have gone down this path of credit investments. We've always felt like, okay, we want to be long-term partners to some of our clients. We are willing to do 20-year paper sale leasebacks on their real estate. We are along the credit. We like the credit and if we can continue to create an even closer relationship by participating, higher up on the capital stack, that is something that makes a lot of sense for us. Especially when you take it in the context stuff, we are experiencing the negative impact of higher interest rate environment on our own balance sheet. And if we can offset using this credit investment as a tool, this negative impact that we experienced by participating on the asset side by providing credit to some of our clients then this is a very nice way to hedge this negative impact. Having said all of this, we've also been very clear that credit investment is going to be a point in time. This is not a tool that will work in every environment, and we don't expect to do credit investments in a very low interest rate environment. And so for all of the reasons that I've just enumerated, it's a wonderful tool to have. And thankfully, we have the relationships with clients who want us to participate, we would like to participate and it acts as a natural hedge to some of the negative headwinds that we encounter in this environment. So that's why we did what we did. Yes. So the areas that give us that higher internal growth largely are the two you've mentioned and the international market. And obviously, this is not a new vertical for us, but industrial does tend to have higher internal growth as well. And the combination of our investments in these areas have resulted in the profile of internal growth changing from circa 1% in our business to 1.5%. And that will continue to be the areas that we focus in, in the future. I think this was a question that was asked in the previous call as well. Are there any new verticals that we are looking at? And the answer is no. We have a very well-defined total addressable market based on the verticals that we've already articulated to the market, and we are very comfortable continuing to play in those specified verticals. And there's plenty to be done. So we're very happy with that. Yes. I don't necessarily agree with the last comment that you made in your question that John. But I'll go ahead and answer this question around investment grade representing 10% of our investments in the second quarter. We've always been very clear with the market when we've said that we don't target investment grade as a criteria for investment. What we are looking for is are we generating the right yield for the credit risk that we are taking for the real estate risk that we are taking, etcetera. And the actual ratings of the client is a byproduct of being able to underwrite appropriate risk-adjusted return profile. And if it so happens that we have clients that are investment grade as a result of that risk-adjusted profile that we are targeting. That's great. But it's not something we specifically look for. Case in point, John, if you look at our portfolio today, there are so many names in our top 20. That just happened to be non-rated. And have they gone through a rating process, they would be investment-grade. Companies like Sainsbury's, Treasury Wine Estate, we have grocers like Public and Trader Joe's that are not rated today and don't constitute an investment-grade bucket for us, but if they were to be rated, they would be. And so the point I'm trying to make is it's not something that we target. It's a byproduct of our underwriting, and we are very comfortable continuing down that path. So Haendel, yes, the last comment you made is accurate. We are not anticipating doing any credit investments in the second half but just to be very clear, credit investments is something that we have used opportunistically in the past, and we will continue to use opportunistically going forward. But it is not contemplated that we will do any in the second half. Having said that, you're right, this is a secured bond offering. And so it is the security that we have is obviously a lot of the unencumbered real estate that as continues to own. You're also correct in assuming that we are very comfortable going along the credit. You might recall in the third quarter of last year. We did a fairly large -- I want to say, norther $600 million of sale leaseback with Asda. So this is a credit that we are very comfortable with. We like the operators. We like what they're trying to do with their business. And this is a way for us to continue to strengthen that relationship going forward. But yes, part of what we are trying to do is in the event they decide to go down the path of doing sales leasebacks, we're going to be first in line. There are no guarantees, but we will be first in line for those conversations. And that's exactly the type of position we would like to be in going forward with clients such as this. Sure. Good question, Haendel. Look, I think it's a little too early, but the reality is that in the event that interest rates do start to come down, private equity that has largely been absent from the market should start to come back in. We are not currently seeing that in the transaction that we are pursuing. We are seeing some institutional capital, I wouldn't call them private equity coming into the market and becoming a bit more aggressive. But it's not prevalent yet. But yes, if the interest rate environment continues to be positive, i.e., rate cuts start to materialize, finding private equity as a competitor is certainly something that we should expect. You talked about us becoming more aggressive given our cost of capital having improved, especially over the last couple of weeks. That is true. And our cost of capital has improved. But the point I want to keep making, Haendel, is we want to remain very disciplined. We do believe that there will be more transactions that should take place just given the backdrop that we've talked about. But we don't have to do a whole lot to generate the earnings guidance that we've shared with the market. And if the market opportunistically produces transaction for us, that we feel like makes a lot of sense for our portfolio, we will absolutely be first in line to take advantage of that. And that's the position that we want to be in. And -- but I don't think the fact that our cost of capital has improved, that's going to be the impetus to go out there and start doing more transactions. I think the materialization of actual transactions that we would like to be successful pursuing that is going to drive what we do in the second half. And we feel based on everything that we are seeing, plus the pipeline that we have, very confident that the investment market will continue to improve. Smedes, there are some large front actions that will be coming to market in the second half. These are existing clients that we have that we are in constant conversations with as to whether we are lucky enough to win those transactions or whether they actually end up coming to market is still a bit of a question mark. But we are starting to see those types of conversations taking place, and we feel pretty good that the market is going to improve. Our pipeline is largely along the lines of what we've achieved to date on the straight up organic acquisition side. And there aren't any $1 billion portfolio. So that's what you're thinking that we have in our pipeline yet. But the conversation leads me to believe that there will be larger portfolios coming down, but we'll see. Sure, Greg. So a lot of it is very, it's opportunistic. It is an analysis, a very deep analysis that the asset management team takes on looking at assets for existing clients that may not have the right return profile that longer term because the markets have changed, or that particular location is not what it used to be. There could be several reasons as to why they get into the disposition list, one of which could be credit as well. And so we are using our predictive analytic tools to help monitor these 15,000 assets that we have at any given point in time and it's coming out with a rating that then suggests that, hey, this one may have a high location risk or low fungibility available to these locations. And then we overlay the credit on top of that. And then asset management goes through those and tries to create various different areas of what is the economic outcome going to look like under , for instance, a client that may not have any credit issues will pay rent. But at the end, this asset may not have other alternatives available to it outside of a vacant sale. And that return profile will be compared with selling it today to see what yields a better outcome. And that's the analysis that the asset management team is undertaking far more directly today than I think we've done in the past and that's the reason why we've come up with the $400 million to $500 million of assets that we feel like does not necessarily have a long-term future in our portfolio. And that's how we come up with the list. Greg, as you know, I think I don't see the cap rates moving out from these levels. And in fact, they probably are going to start to come in going forward just given the backdrop that we are all experiencing with better cost of capital, more competitors are going to start to come in. It's going to put pressure on the cap rates. So, but in terms of spread, which is how we think of our business, we are very hopeful of maintaining the spreads that we've achieved thus far. And it could be a combination of our improving cost of capital despite perhaps a slightly lower cap rate environment. But we are going to be very selective in what it is that we pursue, which is why we have not gone out and increased our acquisition guidance. But let's wait and see what happens over the next couple of months. Things are fairly volatile with elections coming up later this year. And obviously, we see what's happening on the geopolitical side. So it is a bit of a volatile period. But having filtered all of that, I think you should expect to see us trying to maintain the spreads that we've achieved thus far. Yes. Good question, Upal. You should expect at the end of it all, half of it to be occupied assets and half of it to be vacant assets. So clearly, the trend for the first half has been more vacant asset sales. So that's going to shift going forward. It is a slight shift in our strategy, but not if it is driven by two very large M&A deals that we've effectuated over the last 2.5 years. And clearly, and we've been very upfront about this. There are assets that we've inherited that it's not a long-term strategic hold for us. And so we just want to be more proactive in being able to dispose of these assets. And given the quantum of capital that this particular process can generate for i.e., $400 million to $500 million, we wanted to be very clear with the market that look, this is going to be a source of capital for us that you may or may not be aware of. And so people can appropriately underwrite that source of capital. And when we make statements like we don't have to be out in the equity market, this helps explain that piece. But the strategic rationale is always are constant vigilance on what is it that our portfolio looks like? Where has our strategic shifts occurred given everything that we are seeing and being a lot more proactive on the disposition side than we had traditionally been. Sure. So obviously, a lot of sellers were on the sideline hoping for cap rates to move, we've always talked about the cost of capital is a mark-to-market variable that's essentially getting marked every second but cap rates tend to be stickier. And when the cost of capital changed as abruptly as it did for a lot of the REIT sector, the sellers were not able to accept that environment. And so they were waiting on the sidelines, expecting things to change, but sellers can't wait indefinitely. And we've seen that phenomenon play out in the international markets more so than here. And so when that happens, sellers start to creep back into the market after a period of time. And the added element that's taking place is there's a little bit more clarity today, and I say that and I smile as to where the interest rates are going to go, and so obviously, the cost of capital side of the equation has changed for a lot of the REITs. And so this is going to allow them to transact on transactions on assets that they would have looked at doing had their cost of capital being better. And so I think it's a movement on the buyer side. It's going to be a movement on the seller side. And that's what I mean that this should facilitate more transactions in the second half than it has in the first half. Linda, the way to think about bad debt is we start the year expecting a certain percentage of bad debt expense. And in certain years, we either meet bills in a lot of years, we beat them. And in certain other years like the pandemic year, it goes beyond what we had originally gone into the year with. I think this is one of those -- like last year, for instance, we had positive outcomes on what our initial expectation was, which was, I think, 40, 50 basis points of rent. And all of last year, we not only did not have any bad debt expense, we actually ended up collecting on rents that we had on cash accounting. So that was a positive outcome. This year, this seems to be trending more in line with what we had anticipated at the beginning of the year. And there is some potential upside, but we are not -- we've still got five months left, and we'll see how things play out. But traditionally, it's been right around that 23% absent the pandemic year. And inclusive of the pandemic year, it's been right around 37%, 37 basis points, sorry, 37 basis points of rent that has basically been bad debt expense. So do we expect 2025 to be similar, yes? But we generally don't talk about years well in advance, which is why I'm pointing to what historically has happened at Realty Income. We don't, Alex, which is why we are in litigation and which is where the upside comes from. So we've essentially that this year is going to be a resolution year. Once we get those assets back, we are very confident in our ability to find alternative clients in the C-store space for those particular locations. So that's where the upside is. And no, we are not expecting to resolve any of that this year. For the first half of the year spent it was here in the U.S. That's the reason why our volumes were much lower than what was -- that's what was traditionally seen in what we've done. I think that's starting to compress that bid-ask spread, which is the reason why we feel pretty confident that the markets here in the U.S. is going to start to materialize favorably for us. And yes, so that's what we see. Thanks, Ronald. So on the gaming side, just based on performance of the assets that we have visibility into -- it's clearly been a great investment for us. Both the assets that we currently either own 100% or partially owned have continued to perform, and we -- then the leases that were structured were, in our view, very favorable leases. It was a fair lease both to the operator and to us. And I'm not sure if there's anything there that we would change based on what we've learned over the last two years. On the data center side, we've only got one investment that has now come online. And we are very excited about continuing to work with our partner, our existing partner and some new partners that we are trying to cultivate within this space. Like I've said, the hyperscale business with enterprise clients, it's a massive business and one that I don't think any single or even three, four sources of capital can solve. And we believe that this is a total addressable market that has a place for somebody like us partnering with the right developers, operators to create our own portfolio that grows from where we are today. And I don't need to go into the thesis as to the why, but it's fairly new for us to really reflect on lessons learned. We are still trying to build that particular pipeline up. And in time, I'm sure we will share lessons learned. But one of the things that we are very focused on, and this is not necessarily based on our own history, but the history of this particular sector is to make sure that the rents that we are underwriting to day one are rents that can be supported come to renewal time, even 10, 15 years out. And I think that was one of the lessons that this particular sector had to learn the hard way when they went through renewals and they were taking write-downs in space. But outside of that, make sure that things that can become obsolete are investments that we would want the operator to make. And we stay as close and as true to the real estate as we possibly can. That's really the lens through which we are looking at the data center space. No. The 84% is our historical average through the bankruptcy process. So any client that goes through a Chapter 11 process and if you compare the emerging rent to the pre-bankruptcy rent, that recapture rate is 84%. And Linda, if you look at the amplitude within that 84%, if you actually look at individuals, we've had situations where we've collected 70% or 65% of the rent. And then there have been situations where we've collected 100% of the rent pre-bankruptcy versus post-bankruptcy. So there is variance around this 84%, but that has historically been what we've achieved. And that's the number that we are sharing with the market. Thank you. Thank you all for joining us today. We look forward to speaking soon and seeing you at conferences in the coming months."

            "content": "Thank you, Sumit. Consistency has long been a benchmark by which we manage our business. To that end, we ended the second quarter with leverage at 5.3 times without settling any ATM equity during the quarter. This was the 25th consecutive quarter of leverage at 5.5 times or lower, reflecting our commitment to our A3, A- credit ratings, which we have had now since 2018. As a reminder, we manage our leverage through the lens of net debt and preferred equity to annualize pro forma adjusted EBITDA. During the second quarter, we generated approximately $200 million of adjusted free cash flow, over $100 million in real estate sales proceeds, and approximately $185 million of forward unsettled equity sold through the ATM. After modest ATM issuance activity subsequent to quarter end, we currently have almost $450 million of unsettled forward equity, which we estimate will be more than sufficient to finance our equity needs for the remainder of 2024 and still remain within our target leverage ratios. Our balance sheet remains healthy with a well-staggered debt maturity schedule that allows us to be active should borrowing costs trend lower over the maturity cycle. Last month, we repaid $350 million of maturing public notes, leaving us with only $118 million of maturing mortgage debt for the balance of the year. Our exposure to variable [ph] rate debt of $1.6 billion remains modest at only 6.3% of total debt principal at quarter end, and our liquidity remains solid with access to approximately $3.8 billion of capital. At the end of the second quarter, inclusive of cash on hand, availability under our $4.25 billion revolving credit facility and our outstanding ATM forward equity. We remain comfortable with the liability side of the balance sheet and believe we are well positioned to act on larger investment opportunities should they present themselves. As Sumit mentioned earlier, we view our credit investments as a natural hedge to the inherent interest rate risk associated with debt maturities we have on our balance sheet. That end, the six year \u00a3300 million sterling senior secure loan we invested in during the quarter provides us with an attractive 8.1% yield secured by the solid credit of a U.K. grocery store operator, while reducing the rate sensitivity on the value of sterling debt we have on the balance sheet maturing in 2030, which currently totals \u00a3540 million. From a 2024 earnings guidance perspective, we are reiterating our full year investments at $3 billion in our AFFO per share guidance of $4.15 to $4.21, which represents 4.5% annual per share growth, assuming the midpoint. As a reminder, we increased our guidance on June 4, which included the expectation of collecting the $16 million of lease termination fees that we recognized in the second quarter. Offsetting a portion of AFFO tailwinds with termination fees was the recognition of approximately $6.2 million of AR reserves from one of our clients in the convenience store industry. Lease termination fees are excluded and are same-store rental revenue calculations, while AR reserves are included. Thus, the $6.2 million of reserves that we recognized on one client in the quarter alongside impacts by theatre portfolio held back our second quarter same-store rent growth by approximately 60 basis points, resulting in overall same-store growth of 0.2% for the quarter. Including this reserve, we continue to expect our full-year same-store rental revenue growth recovered to close to the 1% level for 2024. With that, I would like to hand the call back to Sumit for closing remarks. Yes. So if you just look at what we disclosed in the footnotes of the income statement on the earnings press release or the supplement, you'll see that we've recognized around $9 million on a year-to-date basis in bad debt expense. And so looking at that as a percentage of revenue, it is around 70 basis points or so. Now what we've always said is that historically, we've been roughly in the 35 basis point range as a percentage of revenue is the bad debt expense. And when you strip out the pandemic, it's closer to 23 basis points. So we're a little bit ahead of that, but a lot of that was related to this $6 million reserve that we did and uptaking on 1 C-store operator, we do not expect the magnitude of that to carry forward into the back half of the year. But there is still a little bit of conservatism there. And I think from our standpoint, even though we feel very good about a lot of these credits. I think in the back half of the year, you can assume that we're assuming something close to what we recognized in the first half. Yes, Smedes those related to one particular tenant. And it's really reflective of an agreement that our team will be able to reach with them for a handful of assets, not the entire exposure, but just a handful. Yes. So Linda, first of all, there's some moving pieces with this year's guidance of approximately 1% on same-store. It's a difficult year-over-year comp because we did have some reserve reversals and deferment payments that we realized last year. Last year, we had 1.9% was our same-store number. This year at 2%, you're kind of averaging -- this year at 1%, excuse me, you're kind of averaging outside 1.5 or so level. And so next year, there should be an easing of the difficult comps, but what we've always been framing for investors, especially more recently is that we are around 1.5% on a contractual rent basis, growth basis. And we would expect that to continue next year and beyond. Yes, look, so if we were to sit here today and guess what indicative is might be on 10-year unsecured paper, you're probably looking at the very low 5s, call it, 5.1, 5.2 for U.S. dollar and sterling and then you're probably looking at very low 4s, about 100 basis points tighter in the Eurozone. So we always want to have a level of flexibility, I think when you look at how far wide sterling has traded relative to the dollar over the last few years and now that it's back to parity, we have been leaning more towards the dollar side over the last few years, and the optionality is there for us because we do have the currency net investment hedge capacity to be active in the sterling market. But obviously, the more euro deals that we do and transact on the greater the ability for us to access 4% paper will be. So these are the kind of things that we think about on a daily basis. A lot of it depends on the currency of the assets that we're bringing on the books. But we're glad that we left quite a bit of capacity in these currencies that are starting to trade at parity or even inside of it relative to a dollar. Yes. So definitely it wasn't much of a drag this year. I mean luckily, for us, we came out and did a debt offering in January and that was in the very low 5s, just above 5. So when you look at it on a year-over-year basis, not a big difference. We did obviously have a $350 million bond that we did repay. So there's a little bit of dilution from that. But I think when you look into 2025, we've got $1.8 billion, $1.9 billion, a 4.2% I just talked about how maybe there's 100 basis points of dilution if we were to do something like sterling and dollars based off of today's indicative rates that would have no more than about a 50 basis point impact to earnings. So it's obviously come in quite a bit. But obviously, if we have something from a euro standpoint that we can take advantage of that it will be breakeven for 2025 for short-term borrowings. Yes, it has been a little bit more dilutive because we peaked with the Fed funds rate this year. But I think much better than it was last year where that was close to 2% of growth that was held back solely because of that."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Realty Income Q1 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would like now to turn the conference over to Mr. Steve Bakke, Senior Vice President of Corporate Finance. Please go ahead.\nSteve Bakke: Thank you all for joining us today for Realty Income's first quarter operating results conference call. Discussing our results will be Sumit Roy, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jonathan Pong, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. During this conference call, we will make statements that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities law. The company's actual future results may differ significantly from the matters discussed in any forward-looking statements. You'll disclose in greater detail the factors that may cause such differences in the company's Form 10-Q. We will be observing a two-question limit during the Q&A portion of the call in order to give everyone the opportunity to participate. If you would like to ask additional questions, you may reenter the queue. I will now turn the call over to our CEO, Sumit Roy.\nSumit Roy: Thank you, Steve. Welcome, everyone. Our results for the start of 2024 illustrate our focus on thoughtful, disciplined growth and continue to demonstrate the consistency of our global operating and acquisition platform. We believe our value proposition to investors is a simple one. Our demonstrated ability to generate consistent positive operational returns regardless of market volatility and economic environment. Our projected 2024 operational return profile of approximately 10%, which comprises an anticipated dividend yield close to 6% and AFFO per share growth of approximately 4.3%, assuming the midpoint of guidance is a validation of our value proposition. To summarize the results from the quarter, we would highlight several key takeaways. First, diversification. Diversification by geography, asset types and client relationships. We believe our business model is unique in the real estate sector as we have optionality to grow in different regions with investments in a multitude of real estate products where we see superior risk-adjusted returns. During the first quarter, we invested $598 million at an initial weighted average cash yield of 7.8% across three property types: retail, industrial and data centers. Over half of this volume representing approximately $323 million was invested in Europe and the U.K. at an 8.2% initial weighted average cash yield. Investment volume in the U.S. was modest during the quarter. Of the $275 million of U.S. volume, which was invested at a 7.3% initial weighted average cash yield all but $16 million was invested in previously committed development takeouts. This quarter's bias towards international volume is a testament to the diversity of geographies we consider to allocate capital. To further elaborate, our investment volume during the quarter consisted of 87 discrete transactions with three transactions over $50 million, which speaks to the breadth of our platform. Our ultimate focus with any growth vertical or new region is to serve as a real estate partner to the world's leading companies and to ensure the investment outcome matches the consistent risk return profile of our investments, which have proven resilient over almost five decades as an operating company and three decades as a public company. Second, the health of our portfolio remains solid across all key operational metrics. We finished the quarter with occupancy of 98.6% consistent with the prior quarter and our projections. And we delivered another strong leasing quarter with rent recapture of 104.3% on the 198 leases that we renewed or re-leased during the quarter. At quarter end, our list of tenants on the credit watch list comprise approximately 5.2% of total portfolio annualized rent, which is in line with our historical average and with no individual client representing more than 1% of our total portfolio annualized rent. Consequently, we would highlight the diversification of our portfolio, which today consists of over 1,500 clients in all 50 states, the UK and six other countries in Western Europe, all of which helps insulate us from potential disruptive interest rate and credit events that could impact the durability of our cash flow. Finally, our balance sheet and access to capital continues to represent a major competitive advantage and affords us significant flexibility to fund our business without the need for external capital. After the Spirit merger closed in January, our annualized free cash flow available for investments is approximately $825 million. This provides us significant organic investment capacity to finance our growth plans without being required to tap into the debt or equity markets to meet current investment guidance. I would also note this also excludes any additional capacity generated by our disposition program, which I will discuss later. In spite of volatility in the capital markets, we posted a nominal first year investment spread of over 340 basis points in the first quarter, which is well above our historical spread of around 150 basis points. The primary driver of these outside spreads is the significant portion of investment volume funded to free cash flow, which by virtue of being a non-diluted source of capital, meaningfully reduces our nominal first year cost of capital. To be clear, our investment decisions remain based on our long-term weighted average cost of capital, which considers only our cost of stock for equity and long-term 10-year unsecured debt. This establishes the minimum return hurdle we seek to exceed across our aggregate investment activity. In all cases, our long-term WACC has exceeded our nominal first year cost of capital with respect to our transactions. This long-term oriented underwriting model is what drives our focus on acquiring high-quality real estate, leased to solid operators who are leaders in their respective industries, because we believe these opportunities have significantly lower residual risk -- value risk. In addition, to reach our longer-term growth hurdle rates, we are increasingly prioritizing meaningful contractual rent escalators in our leases with conservative rent coverage metrics that we believe will be even more resilient through a variety of economic cycles. In summary, activity in the transaction market remains uneven. Many potential sellers of real estate remain sidelined, given this uncertain interest rate environment, which is amplified by mixed inflation related data over the last six months. Sellers remain reluctant to transact and the breadth and depth of domestic investment opportunities have compressed as a result. However, as experienced in prior cycles, we remain optimistic that the market will provide more opportunities in the second half of the year as the economic outlook becomes clearer. Turning to portfolio operations. As previously mentioned, our recapture rate was 104.3%, contributing to same-store rent growth of 0.8% in the first quarter. Excluding the negative impact from our Sinovel theater portfolio, following the lease amendments finalized late last year, our same-store portfolio was up 1.4%, largely in line with the contractual rent growth embedded in our portfolio. One of our competitive advantages in the marketplace is our asset management and real estate operations functions, consisting of over 80 individuals who we believe are among the most talented in the industry. Since becoming a public company in 1994, we have now resolved over 6,000 lease expirations at a blended rent recapture rate of 102.5%, which is a testament to our acquisition underwriting, quality of our real estate and the scale of our asset management and real estate operations teams. During the quarter, we sold 46 properties for total net proceeds of $95.6 million. Our recycling efforts are a function of a more active investment management initiative. Our active decision-making on dispositions is supported by our proprietary predictive analytics platform. In recent years, we have harnessed the collective contributions of our predictive analytics team, the credit underwriting group, and the fundamental input from our asset management group to inform our acquisition strategy. We believe the combined benefits of these three groups provide us a significant differentiation in the industry as a result of the quantum of data we have gathered across our portfolio over our long operational history. So now in addition to our acquisition program, we are using the data to more proactively manage the portfolio and guide our active disposition program. I will now turn it over to Jonathan, who will add further color to the quarter.\nJonathan Pong: Thank you, Sumit. It's been a quiet start to the year on the capital markets front, following our January US dollar bond offering, which raised $1.25 billion in gross proceeds at a blended yield to maturity of approximately 5.14%. As introduced in our prior earnings call, our financing strategy for 2024 does not require incremental capital to finance our growth and acquisition needs. This continues to be the case at our current investment guidance. To that end, we had another quarter with a net debt and preferred equity, annualized pro forma adjusted EBITDA ratio of 5.5 times, that's in line with our target ratio. During the quarter, we settled approximately $550 million of equity previously raised through our ATM program, and which was outstanding on a forward basis. This leaves us with approximately $63 million of outstanding equity available for future settlements. And when combined with approximately $825 million of annualized free cash flow available to us following the Spirit merger, and the disposition program that Sumit referenced, our $2 billion investment guidance for the year is one, we believe can be funded without having to tap the markets. Our debt maturity schedule for the remainder of the year is modest, with approximately $469 million of remaining maturities, excluding $342 million of short-term commercial paper and revolver borrowings and of cash. As always, we look to maintain significant financial flexibility to fund known and identified liquidity and with approximately $4 billion of total liquidity available to us and minimal variability debt exposure on the balance sheet, we believe we can refinance these maturities while still retaining significant liquidity headroom and keeping ydebt exposure well below 10% of our debt capital stack through the balance of the year. With that, I'll turn it back over to Sumit for closing remarks.\nSumit Roy: Thank you, Jonathan. In summary, the year is off to a solid start that is in line with expectations. Our earnings growth profile for the balance of the year remains consistent with our outlook and earnings guidance we gave in February. The tempered pace of activity in the first quarter reflects our long-standing capital allocation discipline, and we will remain selective as cap rates adjust to the current rate environment. In the meantime, the levers we can exercise from an internal funding standpoint, in particular, free cash flow and capital recycling, allow us to continue investing at spreads well over 200 basis points on a leverage-neutral basis. Our approximately 4% AFFO per share projected growth rate, paired with our estimated annualized dividend yield of approximately 6% is why we believe our platform offers one of the most compelling investment opportunities in the S&P 500. With that, I would like to open it up for questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Nate Crossett with BNP. Please go ahead.\nNate Crossett: Hey, good afternoon. I was wondering if you could just talk about the current pipeline what does pricing look like so far into 2Q? Where is the pipeline weighted? And I know it's this most sample size, but pretty attractive yields in Europe in the quarter. Is there anything to note there?\nSumit Roy: Thanks, Nate. Good question. I think what you're seeing here in the U.S. is largely a confusion around where the rates are going. When will the rate cuts materialize and it's a function of what we've seen play out over the last six months in terms of mixed data that is causing this confusion. And the way it's manifesting in our space is this reluctance of sellers to transact at what is reflective of the cost of capital environment today. And so for us, this is one of the advantages we bring to the table is we play in multiple geographies. And we are seeing much better risk-adjusted return opportunities in Europe today, where the data has been a lot more consistent, and therefore, the ability to transact with potential sellers much more real. And that's kind of the reason why you've seen 54% of the volume manifest itself in Europe versus here in the US. And I suspect, because your question was very specific around the current pipeline and what we think will happen in the second quarter, I suspect it will be a similar slant to the results. But I do believe that the second half of the year, we should start to see a lot more transactions materialize. I know that the team is actually in conversations with multiple potential sellers, but the disconnect happens to be where that reservation price is for potential sellers. But we do believe that once the environment becomes a little clearer in terms of what's going to happen with rates and when will those potential rate cuts come to fruition, I think the transaction market in the US will catch up.\nNate Crossett: Okay. That's helpful. And then if I could just ask one on the tenant credit side. What's on the watchlist right now that we should be tracking and maybe you could speak to Red Lobster, specifically because that's been in the news recently\nSumit Roy: Sure. So the ones that we currently have on our watchlist, Rite Aid, that represents about 31 basis points of rent. It's still going through bankruptcy. We are very hopeful that it will emerge from bankruptcy soon. But like I said, it's a very small portion of our overall portfolio. Joan is another one that was on our -- is on our watchlist. That represents 4 basis points of rent and our expectation is that all six leases are going to be assumed at 100% recapture, just given the way they're planning on emerging from bankruptcy. Every other name that's on our watchlist is sub-4% in terms of names that are currently in bankruptcy. So it's a -- it's obviously a very, very small portion of our overall watchlist. The ones that are not on -- not currently in bankruptcy but continue to garner a fair amount of interest here internally, is Red Lobster, the one that you just mentioned. We have about 216 leases. It represents 1.07% of our rent. The cash flow coverage that we have across all 216 assets is right around two times and 201 of these 216 leases happen to be part of a master lease. So I just wanted to frame our exposure to Red Lobster, before I go into some color around the name itself. I think of Red Lobster is -- it's a pretty strange story. They have 700 unique locations. They garner 14% of the casual seafood concept. That is a very hard thing to do. And the fact that they generate north of $2 billion in revenue, if you look at it on a per unit basis, that's just right around $3.5 million per unit. So it's not a top line issue, as much as it is an operations issue. They've gone through several changes in terms of ownership. Obviously, there have been several changes in terms of management. And this is a business that, in our opinion, hasn't been very well run. If you look at the balance sheet, is it a balance sheet issue at Red Lobster. In our opinion, it's not. They have $220 million of debt and this is really a question of, is there an operator out there that could come in and basically manage this business even to a reasonable level of margins. Today, I don't believe they're generating a whole lot of EBITDA. But having said that, our 200 assets has two times coverage. So that should tell you that we obviously have assets that are some of the best assets in their portfolio. And so if this can be operationally rightsized, we believe that this is a concept that should come out, and should survive and do quite well, given the footprint that they've been able to establish. So, that's our view. We are keeping a close eye on it. As far as rents are concerned, we've collected 100% of the rents due to us as of May. So, it's a wait and see, but it does happen to be on our watch list.\nOperator: The next question comes from Greg McGinniss of Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nGreg McGinniss: Hey Sumit. Are you able to provide more details on the active disposition program you're talking about maybe in terms of targeted volumes industries or how you're identifying assets for recycling?\nSumit Roy: Sure. Good question, Greg. So, what we are hoping to achieve is circa $400 million to $500 million of asset dispositions this year. We can't be very precise around it because part of it is a function of the market. We expect that the occupied sales and the vacant asset sales is going to be approximately 50/50. Obviously, in the first quarter, it was disproportionately vacant asset sales. I think $82 million of the $96 million was vacant asset sales, $14 million were occupied. But what we are trying to do is intentionally get ahead of some of these assets that happen to be on our watch list. And not always is it being driven by a credit issue. It's -- sometimes it is purely a real estate issue that our asset management team has concluded, does not have a long-term position in our overall portfolio. And then there are certain trends that we are seeing that we want to try to get ahead of based on client conversations, et cetera, that is also going to allow us to be a lot more proactive and get ahead of situations, well in advance of it becoming an issue downstream. In terms of the actual concepts themselves, it is along the lines of what we have been selling. Some of it is automotive services. There are some drug stores that we believe are not part of the overall strategy. Some of it is going to be the Cineworld assets that, by the way, the sale process is going, I would say, ahead of what our expectations were. And then some that are perhaps not, like I said, core to what our overall strategy is on the discount store side as well that we want to try to get ahead of. So, those are the components that will make up what we want to try to get disposed of this year.\nGreg McGinniss: Okay. And is that $400 million to $500 million the kind of entirety of the program? Is that a first step? And then how are you thinking about as that compares to the level of acquisitions that you're targeting this year, what that might mean for growth in 2025?\nSumit Roy: Look, we've got to execute our plan based on what we believe is the right portfolio that's going to take us into 2025 in a position of strength. We have grown our business through M&A. There have been two very large M&A deals done in the last two and a half, three years. We've been, I believe, very open about not all of those assets have been core to our long-term strategy. And so some of this is largely a function of trying to get back to that core portfolio. We have obviously underwritten the impact of 50% of circa $400 million to $500 million in dispositions being occupied assets. But what you'll find is some of these assets are actually being sold. Look at what we sold or -- and I know it wasn't a big number, but the occupied assets, we actually sold them at a 7% cap rate, cash cap rate and we are reinvesting it at 77%. So it is actually an accretive disposition strategy that we've been able to implement at least for the first quarter. So for us, it's about creating the portfolio that we want to go into 2025 and beyond with. And this is a program that will consistently be executed on going forward. When we are doing sale leasebacks, it's not an issue. When we're doing portfolio transactions on existing leases, not always do we get 100% of what we want. And so being a bit more proactive around culling the assets that is not core to our overall strategy upfront is something that I think we are going to be a lot more intentional about. But we feel very good about our ability to continue to grow despite the strategy in 2025 and beyond.\nOperator: The next question comes from Joshua Dennerlein of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst : Hi. Good afternoon. This is Farrell [ph] on behalf of Josh. I was wondering if you could clarify how bad debt is currently trending. I know you made some comments on the watch list. And perhaps if that has changed at all in your outlook of how much bad debt is baked into guidance?\nJonathan Pong: Hey, Farrell, on the bad debt number, so we did disclose in the earnings press release for Q1, it was about $1.4 million that we actually recognized. As we think about forward-looking guidance and downside scenarios. I think we've been pretty clear in the past that we've been extremely conservative. I think when you sit here today, it's early May, it's a long time to go before the end of the year -- it's not to say that there's any major concerns. I think you heard some talk about the watch list and it's a bunch of small little things that if everything when a yes, maybe could have some impact, but it's certainly not our expected scenario on that front. And so I think it's really a mix of spirits assets that we did acquire that we've always been a little bit more cautious on, and we'll continue to be cautious until we get further into the year. I think for us, we're always pretty conservative as it relates to bad debt expense, especially early in the year. And then finally, there's some identified credits that even more or coating on.\nUnidentified Analyst : Great. And second question about given the cap rates that you're seeing in Europe with coming off of acquisitions, has your thought process or thesis change when you're thinking about development and the yield you can get off that versus these straight-up acquisitions.\nSumit Roy: No, it's a matter of timing, Farrell as the older vintage developments start to roll off, you'll start to notice that some of the newer developments that we've entered into are more reflective of the current cost of capital environment and therefore, the cash cap rate yields that we are expecting on that vintage should creep up. It's just that we entered into our development pipeline 12, 18 months ago. And some of those assets obviously were more reflective of the environment that we were in at that particular point in time. But even at a 7.2% cash cap yield, which is what our development is -- that closed in the first quarter yielded is still circa 150 basis points, 170 basis points of spread. So yes, it's not quite the 7.8% that we were able to achieve on the overall and certainly not 8.2% that we were able to achieve in Europe. But that -- I just wanted to make sure that you are aware that there is a bit of a lag on the development pipeline and the developments that we are entering into today is much more reflective of the environment today.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brad Heffern of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nBrad Heffern: Yes, thanks. Hi everybody. Going back to the European cap rates, it really felt like that market has lagged the US for a long time in terms of recognizing the higher rate environment. I appreciate the outlook has been a bit more stable over there. But is there anything else that's changed in Europe that's now generating these attractive cap rates despite the cost of debt obviously being lower than the US.\nSumit Roy: Yes, Brad, what the cost of debt is certainly lower in Mainland Europe. It's not lower in the UK. I would say trying on top of each other, John. Jonathan is nodding. So the big difference that we see and why potential sellers are willing to transact at the yields that we were able to realize, they're twofold. One, there are funds that have had redemption pressures where they need to monetize real estate, and they are more than willing to reflect what the current cost of capital environment is because they need the capital. And the second, which works really in our favor is the fact that we have established ourselves as the go-to buyer of these types of assets and recognizing that the surety of close, which is very important for these potential sellers is going to be met. And that reputation really does accrue to our benefit, when we are sort of having these conversations, and somebody requires capital near term, and we have the ability to close on these transactions as and when we agree on a particular price. I think it's those 2 factors that's allowing us to be very successful in the UK and in Europe, and is how it's playing out. Here, unfortunately, you don't have similar pressures. Yes, there could be operators that might be willing to transact. But if they have any ability to wait, which in the US, they have a lot more alternatives, they are sort of standing on the sidelines, waiting for the environment to improve for potential buyers to then be able to get the cap rates that they're willing to transact in. So I think that's how I would frame, why we are being successful. One of the reasons is obviously very idiosyncratic to us and the other is it's a reflection of the market.\nBrad Heffern: Okay. Got it. Thank you for that. And then on Dollar Tree Family Dollar, can you remind us what the Family Dollar split is? And talk about any impact that you might have from the closures?\nSumit Roy: Yes. Look, I don't think that the impact for us is going to be disproportionate. We have about 3% of our rent that is Dollar Tree, Family Dollar exposed to Dollar Tree, which obviously is the owner of Family Dollar. And I would say about 60%, circa 60% is Family Dollar and the rest of it is either Dollar Tree or the dual banners that they have. There's about, I want to say 3% of the 3.3%. So that's nine basis points of lease expirations over the next two years, 2.5 years that will materialize. So even if there are these closures and even if some of these assets are named on the closing list, our impact is basically nine basis points. And I can assure you that our asset management team is already working on resolutions given that it is part of the pipeline. Anything beyond that will potentially be closed and will remain dark. We are still going to collect rent. And let me tell you that the pressure on Family Dollar and Dollar Tree is going to be a lot more acute than it is on us to try to find a substitute to step in and take over these leases. And just episodically, there's a fair amount of interest in some of these locations that we've received just along the lines of some of the news that's out there about potential closings, et cetera that we feel pretty good about our ability to resolve the Family Dollar assets. The one thing I'll add, which may not be apparent, Family Dollar tends to be in urban areas and in much more densely populated areas than Dollar Tree or Dollar General. And so the attractiveness of those locations to alternative retail clients is a lot more, and that's borne out by the fact that we have received inbound. So for us, this is no different than learning well in advance that, hey, these particular leases are not going to get renewed and it gives us time to work on some of these leases well in advance of the actual lease expiration. So that's how I would frame it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Goldsmith with UBS. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Katherine Grey [ph] on with Michael. Thanks for taking my questions. My first is, you touched on this a bit at the opening, but how are you thinking about -- if you could maybe just provide some more color, how you're thinking about the cost of free cash flow within the context of your investment spreads?\nSumit Roy: Sure. That's a great question. For us, free cash flow is a massive advantage. The ability to raise $825 million of free cash flow post all obligations is essentially capital that we can use to invest across a variety of areas to accretively grow our earnings. Obviously, when we have free cash flow, we have to figure out what is the best use of that free cash flow. We could buy back our debt, we could buy back our stock, we could continue to invest accretively. And when we find that investing accretively is the best possible use of that capital -- that is a massive advantage. And in a year where we are highlighting the fact that we have $2 billion of acquisitions, and we hope we do better than that, but that's our current guidance. Being able to finance this business with $825 million of free cash flow, which is obviously non-dilutive in nature and grow our earnings is a massive advantage. That's how we think about our free cash flow. There is obviously opportunity cost associated with this. But the way we think about opportunity cost is what's the best use of this capital. And for us, even in this environment, given the platform that we have, and given the diversification benefits of being able to invest across multiple asset types, across multiple geographies, we are continuing to find accretive use of this particular cash flow. And I think, obviously, one of the other things that we do look at is what is the long-term overall return profile. And that is what we compare to our long-term WACC, which is our cost of equity, that 65% and our cost of debt that is 35%. And the cost of equity -- and by the way, we have a few pages on this in our investor deck. It's largely driven by the CAPM model and the dividend growth model. And I think we take the average of the two to come up with our cost effective long-term cost of equity and the long-term cost of debt and it's 65%, 35% weighted. And all of our investments need to meet that hurdle rate and exceed that hurdle rate for us to move forward. So that's really how we think about our cost of capital and how we specifically think about the free cash flow, which obviously we view as a massive advantage to us.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thanks so much for the color. And my second question is on the development piece. So do you expect to see an acceleration of yields for your development projects as we progress through 2024 or even into 2025?\nSumit Roy: We do. Any new development that we are entering into, and I think somebody asked this question as well, we should -- it should be more reflective of the current cost of capital environment. And so as you know, a lot of these developments, they do have a bit of a lag time. And so what you're seeing close today is in that lower 7% ZIP code. But what you should see translate over the next few quarters is to see that cash cap rate continuing to trend much higher, reflecting the current cost of capital.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Anthony Paolone of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Paolone: Thanks. First question relates to the Europe acquisitions in the quarter and the yields there. Can you talk a bit more about what kinds of embedded rent bumps are included in that? How much was maybe traditional net lease versus maybe multi-tenant assets? Because it looked like duration was a little bit on the shorter side.\nSumit Roy: Yes. So a lot of these were retail parks. And let's talk a little bit about retail parks because there's a confusion when you say multi-tenanted, we think in terms of what -- how we define multi-tenanted here in the US. This is not like multi-tenanted here in the US. A lot of these are I would say 80% of them are Tier 1 or Tier 2 as we define them, clients that we are pursuing on a freestanding basis. And they happen to be located in a contiguous part. And each one of these units basically has a flow-through from rent to NOI, very similar to what you would find on a freestanding basis. So the growth in these leases, they tend to be shorter, anywhere between five to 10 years. And the growth in these leases could be open market reviews or they could have some of the larger boxes could have more of the regular way growth that we've seen that are tied to inflation, et cetera. But when we are underwriting these assets, we are looking at the composition of the tenants. We're looking at the flow through. We're looking at are these rents above or below market? We're looking at what the long-term profile of the return is going to be. And then we are comparing it to what are we getting these assets at day one in terms of the initial yield. And these assets have really done very well. And some of the numbers, a lot of the renewals come strong, these retail parks that we bought because the freestanding assets haven't gone through a renewal process yet. And the fact that they are very similar in nature to our overall portfolio of 104.3% that we were able to generate this quarter is a reflection of how we are underwriting each one of these retail parks. But that's where we are seeing the value. And the fact that we are now starting to consolidate and control swaps of retail parks across the UK is a massive advantage for us because the kind of conversations we can have with clients that we've obviously wanted to grow with is very different when we control major locations that they would like to continue to stay over the long duration. And I think that's how we are able to generate the value that we are able to generate. And we are doing it at a time point in time where should be told retail parks are starting to change. If you look at the vacancy that you have, it's circa 2%. If you look at the actual growth that we are being able to generate, it's much higher than what was traditionally achieved. And if you also look at the free rent concept that used to exist, we are being able to compress on that concept, just given the fact that we control so much more of retail parks. So this has been a great investment for us. And I just want to make sure that people realize that the flow-through is very similar to a stand-alone net lease business that we've traditionally been involved in. So I'm glad you asked the question, Anthony. Thank you.\nAnthony Paolone: Thanks for all the color. And then just my follow-up is more on the credit side. You spent a bunch of time on that. But can you give us any updated thoughts on AMC, both as it relates to how you're thinking about that credit as well as your specific assets with the box office being down a bunch this year?\nSumit Roy: Yeah. So look, we've gone through one of them already with Cineworld. AMC represents about 1% of our rent. We have, I believe, 39 assets. AMC continues to be able to raise capital in the equity markets. And 2024 is not going to be a great year for the box office. We recognize that. It may be equivalent to last year, maybe it will be even a little bit less than last year given some of the disruptions that occurred in 2023. But the expectation is that 2025 will supersede 2023 and the quality of movie releases will be much higher in 2025 than in 2024. Is it possible that AMC goes through a BK process? Yes, it's absolutely possible. But I can tell you, our experience on Cineworld gives us a lot of confidence that the assets that we have and the resolutions that we've been able to achieve and the restructuring of the rent that was achieved is still going to create an outcome that is very acceptable to us. Tony, just to put things in perspective, our history, and we've had several bankruptcies in our history, our recapture rate has been north of 80%. And I believe if we were to do the full analysis, once we go full cycle on the Cineworld, it's going to be in that ZIP code. And it's not actually even better than that. given some of the resolutions that we are finding on the vacant asset sales that we had touched on last year on Cineworld. So, I believe AMC is going to be a similar story, but it is not trade comp that they're going to go through a BK process, we believe they have enough liquidity to certainly withstand this year and potentially most of next year as well. But if they were to go through a BK process, it's not necessarily a bad thing. I think it will allow them to restructure the debt, which I think continues to be a massive burden and they will emerge stronger for it. And we believe that, again, just like in the Cineworld situation, we have some of their better assets and we will do fairly well even if they were to go through the BK process. So, that's our thoughts on AMC.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Haendel St. Juste of Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nHaendel St. Juste: Hey, good morning out there. Sumit, you mentioned thoughtful and disciplined growth selective a few times about your prepared remarks, clearly suggesting that the activity will remain subdued as you push the more yield and quality, but you did leave the door open in capacity in the gas a little bit more compelling opportunities to emerge in the back half of the year. So, I guess I'm curious maybe some more thoughts on that and how you think about balancing the pace of investment versus your longer term earnings growth target if you'd be willing to push a bit more in the second half, even if that would make -- right opportunities came along? Thanks.\nSumit Roy: Hi Haendel, I'm sorry, it was very difficult to hear you. But I think what you're asking for is, do we expect to accelerate the investments in the latter half of the year given what we are seeing today? And if I didn't quite get that, I apologize. But the answer is, look, we are not trying to look for a particular quantum of acquisitions or investments, we are allowing for the market to dictate how much we'll be able to achieve in a year, which is very uncertain. If you're asking for an opinion, I do believe that especially here in the U.S., the second half of the year, when there is a little bit more clarity in terms of where interest rates are going, et cetera, there will be more opportunities. And Haendel, if you look at what we've been able to achieve over the last few years, we tend to get more than our share of the volume, especially of the product that we are interested in pursuing. And so is it possible that the U.S. acquisition numbers for the remainder of the year is going to be higher than what we achieved in the first quarter, the answer is yes. We certainly do. Do we expect the European momentum to continue? The answer is, yes. Do we expect both these markets to accelerate? The answer is, yes. And I just want to caveat it that this is our opinion, and time will tell. But we feel fairly optimistic about the second half of the year.\nHaendel St. Juste : Thank you for that. And just a follow-up on Europe since we're talking about it here. I think you have close to $10 billion or so, plus or minus asset value there. So I guess I'm curious if there's any change or update on the thinking of a potential spin-off of that platform? Is it large or mature enough? And maybe when do you think that it could be ready to stand on its in? Thank you.\nSumit Roy: That was a loaded question, Haendel, but thank you for asking. The number is, I believe, closer to $11 billion. Yes, if we were to spin that business out, it would be one of the largest REITs in the U.K. But that is absolutely not our intention today. We are very happy with having Europe as part of our overall platform precisely for the reasons that we talked about on this call regarding the first quarter. It allows us the opportunity to play in markets where we have the best risk-adjusted return profiles of investments. And therefore, all of that benefit accrues to our shareholders here in the U.S. And so that's how I'm going to leave it. Again, was this a grand design that we would grow up to $10 billion? No. It's again a function of the platform that we brought in, our cost of capital, our team and their ability to execute unlike any other teams and our ability to form the relationships as quickly as we did and now we consider the de facto net lease company in all of Europe. I mean, those are benefits that has taken us five years to establish. And now we feel like is the time for us to continue to harvest the benefits of establishing ourselves in Europe. So that's how I would answer it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Nick Joseph of Citi. Please go ahead.\nNick Joseph : Thanks. Given the opportunities that you've talked about in the better cap rates in Europe and kind of the thoughtfulness on the long-term weighted average cost of capital. How do additional data center and gaming investments look today on the U.S. side?\nSumit Roy: Thank you for your question, Nick. Yes, I would say about 6% of our investments in the first quarter went towards the digital JV that we have formed. As you may recall, Nick, that is an asset that is being currently developed in Northern Virginia, in Loudoun County. And it won't be operational until the end of this year, the first phase, maybe -- actually, it's the first quarter of next year. And then there could be the second phase that gets kicked in. So as of right now, that is the only investment that we have on the data center side. There are other opportunities that we are looking at. We do have an investment that we will make, we will continue to make in Spain, that is also looking at a data center side that we believe is very well located, and there seems to be a lot of interest in that particular side. That will be our additional spend on the data center side, but that hasn't been substantial to date. But those are really the only two opportunities that we are looking at. We are obviously involved in multiple conversations with multiple operators to try to understand where the real opportunities are versus the optimism that continues to play out in this particular space. And we are hopeful that we can grow our high percent part of our portfolio in a meaningful way over the next few years. But as of right now, a lot of it is just in the initial stages of conversations with potential operators outside of the JV that we have with digital.\nNick Joseph: Thanks. And then just on the gaming side?\nSumit Roy: On the gaming side, things continue to look interesting. We've obviously made two investments. It represents slightly north of 3% of our rents and we are in conversations with other opportunities, including potential development opportunities in large cities. There's a very long tail to some of these development opportunities. But we'll see how some of these conversations translate into actual transactions. But I will say that there was an interesting conversation we were having earlier this year, which has been kind of put on hold for right now that would be a continued growth of our gaming business, but it hasn't quite materialized yet. So we'll see how that plays out.\nOperator: The next question comes from Wes Golladay of Baird. Please go ahead.\nWes Golladay: Hi, everyone. You highlighted all the levers you have to pull. And when you created last year was the credit investment platform. Can you give us an update on that?\nSumit Roy: Yeah, Wes, we continue to look for opportunities on the credit investment side. But please keep in mind that one of the things that's dictating our investments in the credit side is to continue to strengthen relationships with either existing clients or to help facilitate sale leaseback with those existing clients. And if we want to be viewed as a real estate partner to some of the world's leading operators, part of being that partner is to provide capital through the traditional channels that we have established or on a more secured basis to balance sheet lending. And that continues to be how we think about our credit investment. But one of the advantages of doing this Wes, as I'm sure you recognize is this continuous headwinds that we experienced, given the refinancings that we are having to incur at much higher rates. This is a perfect natural hedge to that,, because here we are lending to clients that we have credit exposures to reflective of the current higher interest rate. And that's really part of why we believe that this is such a good strategy for us in the interim, people talk about reinvestment risk. Well, guess what, if the environment is different and interest rates actually go down. We don't have to roll our credit. Our cost of capital should be better. These headwinds that we are facing on our refinancings will dissipate. And we'll be able to, therefore, invest it in more of our traditional sources, this capital that we get back at very good yields. And so really, I think of the credit partly as a defensive mechanism and is a natural hedge to the headwinds that we faced, but also very much in line with trying to become that real estate partner to the world's leading operators, and these are operators with whom we want to continue to grow our relationship.\nWes Golladay: A quick follow-up on that one. So when you talk about the natural hedge, would you look to keep these more SOFR based loans?\nSumit Roy: Yeah. We do have software based loans. But by and large, what we try to do is not expose ourselves to the floating rate element. We try to lock it in, we get it but then no longer becomes a perfect hedge. But given where the environment is and given the expectation of interest rates, we are still very well protected. We have one loan, the ASDA loan that was -- it was -- it's a floater and it's off of the SONIA in the UK. But largely, every other loan that we've made has been a fixed component to it. And keep in mind that we also inherited some loans, one of which actually got paid off at 100% that we inherited from Spirit, and it was a $33 million seller financing that Spirit had provided to imagine, which, by the way, was an outcome that was superior to how we had underwritten it. So yeah, it's -- Jonathan, do you want to add something?\nJonathan Pong: Yes. Well, just to add to that, when we think about it in a natural hedge, I think it's more so a lot of lines of lenders that actually matures, because we look at our maturity schedule, we've got a decent amount of debt coming to well staggered, but on a nominal basis, still pretty significant, $1.9 billion next year, for instance, or $3.26 billion at almost $3 billion in 2027. And so when you have a corresponding asset that could get cold or will get repaid and it's hard to replace that coupon in a lower rate environment, chances are we're much better off as we're refinancing our liabilities and our cost of capital is obviously much lower. So I think that's another way to take through the natural hedge element.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Harsh Hemnani of Green Street. Please go ahead.\nHarsh Hemnani: Thank you. So not a good jump of acquisitions this quarter came from ones that needed the capital and some redemptions. How would you contrast that opportunity set for acquisitions versus maybe the traditional sale-leaseback market when realty income could provide a solution for [indiscernible] financing. It sounds like based on interest rate hopes -- hopes of interest going down, more tenants are looking towards the traditional credit market and trying to look for finite sources of capital rather than locking in sale-leaseback capital for a perpetual period of time. Is that something you're seeing more so in tenant conversations today than compared to a year ago?\nSumit Roy: We are certainly seeing sale-leaseback opportunities. In fact, 13% of what we closed in the first quarter, it was sale-leaseback. But you're right, Harsh. If you compare it to last year, 46% of everything we did was sale leaseback. The year before that, it was closer to 40%. And we are not seeing that. And I think part of it is because clients are trying to figure out ways to not necessarily lock into 20-year, 25-year leases at these elevated cap rates. And so if there is an alternative available to them, be it through the debt markets, which has much shorter duration, even if it is higher, I think they're going to be far more inclined to doing that. But I just want to be very clear that we are -- again, if it's a brand-new client that we don't have a relationship with, we are not going to go and provide them credit if there isn't a compelling sale-leaseback opportunity with them and our desire to have them as part of our client registry is not there. We are not going to be pure credit providers like some of the credit funds out there that exist. So, I do see that changing as there is stability in the rate environment, as people start to get much more comfortable about where things are going to sort of play out, I do believe that sale-leaseback will come roaring back. We are in discussions with some names right now. And it really is a disconnect between where they want to transact and what -- where we are capable of transacting given our cost of capital. So -- but I think it's a matter of time.\nHarsh Hemnani: Thanks for that. I'll leave it there.\nSumit Roy: Thank you, Harsh.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Linda Tsai of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nLinda Tsai: Hi, thank you. Maybe piggybacking off Greg's earlier question on dispositions, your proprietary predictive analytics platform will be used to help with dispose. Could you just give us some more color on how that works? What are some of the inputs to the analysis?\nSumit Roy: Yes. That's where the secret sauce is, Linda. But all right. Let me -- and I don't want to get to pedantic, so try to keep it pretty high level. The way our predictive analytics were it is by industry and even at times by client. But largely, the models work by industry. And it tries to identify the key variables, which could be 20, 30, 40 variables that dictate the predictability of a renewal outcome or a leasing outcome. So the pieces around how we created the predictive analytic tool was to figure out, what was our leasing activity going to look like, where will we -- the risk was defined as, are we going to be able to maintain the rent that we currently have during a renewal period? Or are we -- is it going to go less? Or is it going to be more -- and that's how we define risk, and that's how we've sort of created these algorithms by industry to identify where does risk lie in our portfolio. And as you can imagine, each industry has its own set of variables that dictate that particular outcome. But the biggest piece of all of this. I think the creation of the algorithms, et cetera, is a fairly simple task. I mean it's taken us 3.5, four years. So I don't want to minimize that piece. I've got me looking at me strangely here. But it is the data that we have that allowed us to back test these models and continue to refine and calibrate these models to improve their predictability. I think that's what is whether the true value lies in our platform, having been around for 50 years. And I think that's why you see the kind of results that you see when we are posting the release -- the re-leasing spreads, when we are trying to get ahead in terms of identification of assets that we should, where we are maximizing the return profile of those assets given what we think will happen some lease renewal. I think that's where the predictive analytics tools, along with the asset management team was using on-the-ground experience to sort of share their perspective along with the credit view, that group together is what's dictating how we try to stay ahead with the portfolio. And it's -- it has to be tools driven. It has to be technology driven. When you have 15,400 discrete locations with in 80 different industries with 1,500 different clients I mean it can't be done manually. And so that's the reason why we chose to make this investment Linda, five years ago and several millions in -- this is a tool that we are very, very proud of. And it's now very much part and parcel of every decision we are making. Be it acquisitions, be it disposition, the hold decisions and also, this tool is now being used to dictate the highest and best use for potential vacancies, which may or may not be the old use of that particular asset. And we've seen some of the value creation that, that prediction has yielded for us as a platform. So hopefully, I didn't get too much into the details, but that's really how the pretty expanded tool works\nLinda Tsai: Appreciate the color. And then just in terms of using dispose to get back to that core portfolio you referenced earlier, can you give us some metrics or characteristics of what that looks like. You have more international exposure versus four or five years ago? How does that kind of fit to the core portfolio?\nSumit Roy: Yes. For us, having geographical diversification, the advantages of it played out in the first quarter, right? I mean you saw we were able to find transactions in the UK that had a return profile that far superseded what we are able to find here in the US. And then that will flip, so I think the geographical diversity is a good thing. In terms of the actual composition of the portfolio, we clearly have what we are viewing as an optimal portfolio. And an optimal portfolio, we might like, let's call it, grocery. But we want grocery to be 13% to 14% of our overall portfolio. If that creeps into the 19% to 20%, that's not a good thing. And by the way, I'm giving you an example, that's not the case, grocery happens to be only 10% of our portfolio today. And then there are other areas like apparel that we may not necessarily want to be exposed to at all. But again, using very broad brushes across particular subsectors is not the right answer either. And that's the reason why this tool along with credit, et cetera, they help us devise what we believe to be the optimal portfolio. If you think retail and you step back, we like service-oriented businesses. We like low price point businesses. And -- that's sort of the overarching nondiscretionary overarching elements that we look for on the retail side. That doesn't mean that we won't deviate from this. But over 90% of our retail portfolio, by the way, has one or more of these characteristics. But that's, I think, how you think about the composition and geographical diversification is something that sits on top of that.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Sumit Roy for any closing remarks.\nSumit Roy: Thank you all for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking soon and seeing you at the upcoming conferences. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Sumit Roy",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve. Welcome, everyone. Our results for the start of 2024 illustrate our focus on thoughtful, disciplined growth and continue to demonstrate the consistency of our global operating and acquisition platform. We believe our value proposition to investors is a simple one. Our demonstrated ability to generate consistent positive operational returns regardless of market volatility and economic environment. Our projected 2024 operational return profile of approximately 10%, which comprises an anticipated dividend yield close to 6% and AFFO per share growth of approximately 4.3%, assuming the midpoint of guidance is a validation of our value proposition. To summarize the results from the quarter, we would highlight several key takeaways. First, diversification. Diversification by geography, asset types and client relationships. We believe our business model is unique in the real estate sector as we have optionality to grow in different regions with investments in a multitude of real estate products where we see superior risk-adjusted returns. During the first quarter, we invested $598 million at an initial weighted average cash yield of 7.8% across three property types: retail, industrial and data centers. Over half of this volume representing approximately $323 million was invested in Europe and the U.K. at an 8.2% initial weighted average cash yield. Investment volume in the U.S. was modest during the quarter. Of the $275 million of U.S. volume, which was invested at a 7.3% initial weighted average cash yield all but $16 million was invested in previously committed development takeouts. This quarter's bias towards international volume is a testament to the diversity of geographies we consider to allocate capital. To further elaborate, our investment volume during the quarter consisted of 87 discrete transactions with three transactions over $50 million, which speaks to the breadth of our platform. Our ultimate focus with any growth vertical or new region is to serve as a real estate partner to the world's leading companies and to ensure the investment outcome matches the consistent risk return profile of our investments, which have proven resilient over almost five decades as an operating company and three decades as a public company. Second, the health of our portfolio remains solid across all key operational metrics. We finished the quarter with occupancy of 98.6% consistent with the prior quarter and our projections. And we delivered another strong leasing quarter with rent recapture of 104.3% on the 198 leases that we renewed or re-leased during the quarter. At quarter end, our list of tenants on the credit watch list comprise approximately 5.2% of total portfolio annualized rent, which is in line with our historical average and with no individual client representing more than 1% of our total portfolio annualized rent. Consequently, we would highlight the diversification of our portfolio, which today consists of over 1,500 clients in all 50 states, the UK and six other countries in Western Europe, all of which helps insulate us from potential disruptive interest rate and credit events that could impact the durability of our cash flow. Finally, our balance sheet and access to capital continues to represent a major competitive advantage and affords us significant flexibility to fund our business without the need for external capital. After the Spirit merger closed in January, our annualized free cash flow available for investments is approximately $825 million. This provides us significant organic investment capacity to finance our growth plans without being required to tap into the debt or equity markets to meet current investment guidance. I would also note this also excludes any additional capacity generated by our disposition program, which I will discuss later. In spite of volatility in the capital markets, we posted a nominal first year investment spread of over 340 basis points in the first quarter, which is well above our historical spread of around 150 basis points. The primary driver of these outside spreads is the significant portion of investment volume funded to free cash flow, which by virtue of being a non-diluted source of capital, meaningfully reduces our nominal first year cost of capital. To be clear, our investment decisions remain based on our long-term weighted average cost of capital, which considers only our cost of stock for equity and long-term 10-year unsecured debt. This establishes the minimum return hurdle we seek to exceed across our aggregate investment activity. In all cases, our long-term WACC has exceeded our nominal first year cost of capital with respect to our transactions. This long-term oriented underwriting model is what drives our focus on acquiring high-quality real estate, leased to solid operators who are leaders in their respective industries, because we believe these opportunities have significantly lower residual risk -- value risk. In addition, to reach our longer-term growth hurdle rates, we are increasingly prioritizing meaningful contractual rent escalators in our leases with conservative rent coverage metrics that we believe will be even more resilient through a variety of economic cycles. In summary, activity in the transaction market remains uneven. Many potential sellers of real estate remain sidelined, given this uncertain interest rate environment, which is amplified by mixed inflation related data over the last six months. Sellers remain reluctant to transact and the breadth and depth of domestic investment opportunities have compressed as a result. However, as experienced in prior cycles, we remain optimistic that the market will provide more opportunities in the second half of the year as the economic outlook becomes clearer. Turning to portfolio operations. As previously mentioned, our recapture rate was 104.3%, contributing to same-store rent growth of 0.8% in the first quarter. Excluding the negative impact from our Sinovel theater portfolio, following the lease amendments finalized late last year, our same-store portfolio was up 1.4%, largely in line with the contractual rent growth embedded in our portfolio. One of our competitive advantages in the marketplace is our asset management and real estate operations functions, consisting of over 80 individuals who we believe are among the most talented in the industry. Since becoming a public company in 1994, we have now resolved over 6,000 lease expirations at a blended rent recapture rate of 102.5%, which is a testament to our acquisition underwriting, quality of our real estate and the scale of our asset management and real estate operations teams. During the quarter, we sold 46 properties for total net proceeds of $95.6 million. Our recycling efforts are a function of a more active investment management initiative. Our active decision-making on dispositions is supported by our proprietary predictive analytics platform. In recent years, we have harnessed the collective contributions of our predictive analytics team, the credit underwriting group, and the fundamental input from our asset management group to inform our acquisition strategy. We believe the combined benefits of these three groups provide us a significant differentiation in the industry as a result of the quantum of data we have gathered across our portfolio over our long operational history. So now in addition to our acquisition program, we are using the data to more proactively manage the portfolio and guide our active disposition program. I will now turn it over to Jonathan, who will add further color to the quarter. Thank you, Jonathan. In summary, the year is off to a solid start that is in line with expectations. Our earnings growth profile for the balance of the year remains consistent with our outlook and earnings guidance we gave in February. The tempered pace of activity in the first quarter reflects our long-standing capital allocation discipline, and we will remain selective as cap rates adjust to the current rate environment. In the meantime, the levers we can exercise from an internal funding standpoint, in particular, free cash flow and capital recycling, allow us to continue investing at spreads well over 200 basis points on a leverage-neutral basis. Our approximately 4% AFFO per share projected growth rate, paired with our estimated annualized dividend yield of approximately 6% is why we believe our platform offers one of the most compelling investment opportunities in the S&P 500. With that, I would like to open it up for questions. Thanks, Nate. Good question. I think what you're seeing here in the U.S. is largely a confusion around where the rates are going. When will the rate cuts materialize and it's a function of what we've seen play out over the last six months in terms of mixed data that is causing this confusion. And the way it's manifesting in our space is this reluctance of sellers to transact at what is reflective of the cost of capital environment today. And so for us, this is one of the advantages we bring to the table is we play in multiple geographies. And we are seeing much better risk-adjusted return opportunities in Europe today, where the data has been a lot more consistent, and therefore, the ability to transact with potential sellers much more real. And that's kind of the reason why you've seen 54% of the volume manifest itself in Europe versus here in the US. And I suspect, because your question was very specific around the current pipeline and what we think will happen in the second quarter, I suspect it will be a similar slant to the results. But I do believe that the second half of the year, we should start to see a lot more transactions materialize. I know that the team is actually in conversations with multiple potential sellers, but the disconnect happens to be where that reservation price is for potential sellers. But we do believe that once the environment becomes a little clearer in terms of what's going to happen with rates and when will those potential rate cuts come to fruition, I think the transaction market in the US will catch up. Sure. So the ones that we currently have on our watchlist, Rite Aid, that represents about 31 basis points of rent. It's still going through bankruptcy. We are very hopeful that it will emerge from bankruptcy soon. But like I said, it's a very small portion of our overall portfolio. Joan is another one that was on our -- is on our watchlist. That represents 4 basis points of rent and our expectation is that all six leases are going to be assumed at 100% recapture, just given the way they're planning on emerging from bankruptcy. Every other name that's on our watchlist is sub-4% in terms of names that are currently in bankruptcy. So it's a -- it's obviously a very, very small portion of our overall watchlist. The ones that are not on -- not currently in bankruptcy but continue to garner a fair amount of interest here internally, is Red Lobster, the one that you just mentioned. We have about 216 leases. It represents 1.07% of our rent. The cash flow coverage that we have across all 216 assets is right around two times and 201 of these 216 leases happen to be part of a master lease. So I just wanted to frame our exposure to Red Lobster, before I go into some color around the name itself. I think of Red Lobster is -- it's a pretty strange story. They have 700 unique locations. They garner 14% of the casual seafood concept. That is a very hard thing to do. And the fact that they generate north of $2 billion in revenue, if you look at it on a per unit basis, that's just right around $3.5 million per unit. So it's not a top line issue, as much as it is an operations issue. They've gone through several changes in terms of ownership. Obviously, there have been several changes in terms of management. And this is a business that, in our opinion, hasn't been very well run. If you look at the balance sheet, is it a balance sheet issue at Red Lobster. In our opinion, it's not. They have $220 million of debt and this is really a question of, is there an operator out there that could come in and basically manage this business even to a reasonable level of margins. Today, I don't believe they're generating a whole lot of EBITDA. But having said that, our 200 assets has two times coverage. So that should tell you that we obviously have assets that are some of the best assets in their portfolio. And so if this can be operationally rightsized, we believe that this is a concept that should come out, and should survive and do quite well, given the footprint that they've been able to establish. So, that's our view. We are keeping a close eye on it. As far as rents are concerned, we've collected 100% of the rents due to us as of May. So, it's a wait and see, but it does happen to be on our watch list. Sure. Good question, Greg. So, what we are hoping to achieve is circa $400 million to $500 million of asset dispositions this year. We can't be very precise around it because part of it is a function of the market. We expect that the occupied sales and the vacant asset sales is going to be approximately 50/50. Obviously, in the first quarter, it was disproportionately vacant asset sales. I think $82 million of the $96 million was vacant asset sales, $14 million were occupied. But what we are trying to do is intentionally get ahead of some of these assets that happen to be on our watch list. And not always is it being driven by a credit issue. It's -- sometimes it is purely a real estate issue that our asset management team has concluded, does not have a long-term position in our overall portfolio. And then there are certain trends that we are seeing that we want to try to get ahead of based on client conversations, et cetera, that is also going to allow us to be a lot more proactive and get ahead of situations, well in advance of it becoming an issue downstream. In terms of the actual concepts themselves, it is along the lines of what we have been selling. Some of it is automotive services. There are some drug stores that we believe are not part of the overall strategy. Some of it is going to be the Cineworld assets that, by the way, the sale process is going, I would say, ahead of what our expectations were. And then some that are perhaps not, like I said, core to what our overall strategy is on the discount store side as well that we want to try to get ahead of. So, those are the components that will make up what we want to try to get disposed of this year. Look, we've got to execute our plan based on what we believe is the right portfolio that's going to take us into 2025 in a position of strength. We have grown our business through M&A. There have been two very large M&A deals done in the last two and a half, three years. We've been, I believe, very open about not all of those assets have been core to our long-term strategy. And so some of this is largely a function of trying to get back to that core portfolio. We have obviously underwritten the impact of 50% of circa $400 million to $500 million in dispositions being occupied assets. But what you'll find is some of these assets are actually being sold. Look at what we sold or -- and I know it wasn't a big number, but the occupied assets, we actually sold them at a 7% cap rate, cash cap rate and we are reinvesting it at 77%. So it is actually an accretive disposition strategy that we've been able to implement at least for the first quarter. So for us, it's about creating the portfolio that we want to go into 2025 and beyond with. And this is a program that will consistently be executed on going forward. When we are doing sale leasebacks, it's not an issue. When we're doing portfolio transactions on existing leases, not always do we get 100% of what we want. And so being a bit more proactive around culling the assets that is not core to our overall strategy upfront is something that I think we are going to be a lot more intentional about. But we feel very good about our ability to continue to grow despite the strategy in 2025 and beyond. No, it's a matter of timing, Farrell as the older vintage developments start to roll off, you'll start to notice that some of the newer developments that we've entered into are more reflective of the current cost of capital environment and therefore, the cash cap rate yields that we are expecting on that vintage should creep up. It's just that we entered into our development pipeline 12, 18 months ago. And some of those assets obviously were more reflective of the environment that we were in at that particular point in time. But even at a 7.2% cash cap yield, which is what our development is -- that closed in the first quarter yielded is still circa 150 basis points, 170 basis points of spread. So yes, it's not quite the 7.8% that we were able to achieve on the overall and certainly not 8.2% that we were able to achieve in Europe. But that -- I just wanted to make sure that you are aware that there is a bit of a lag on the development pipeline and the developments that we are entering into today is much more reflective of the environment today. Yes, Brad, what the cost of debt is certainly lower in Mainland Europe. It's not lower in the UK. I would say trying on top of each other, John. Jonathan is nodding. So the big difference that we see and why potential sellers are willing to transact at the yields that we were able to realize, they're twofold. One, there are funds that have had redemption pressures where they need to monetize real estate, and they are more than willing to reflect what the current cost of capital environment is because they need the capital. And the second, which works really in our favor is the fact that we have established ourselves as the go-to buyer of these types of assets and recognizing that the surety of close, which is very important for these potential sellers is going to be met. And that reputation really does accrue to our benefit, when we are sort of having these conversations, and somebody requires capital near term, and we have the ability to close on these transactions as and when we agree on a particular price. I think it's those 2 factors that's allowing us to be very successful in the UK and in Europe, and is how it's playing out. Here, unfortunately, you don't have similar pressures. Yes, there could be operators that might be willing to transact. But if they have any ability to wait, which in the US, they have a lot more alternatives, they are sort of standing on the sidelines, waiting for the environment to improve for potential buyers to then be able to get the cap rates that they're willing to transact in. So I think that's how I would frame, why we are being successful. One of the reasons is obviously very idiosyncratic to us and the other is it's a reflection of the market. Yes. Look, I don't think that the impact for us is going to be disproportionate. We have about 3% of our rent that is Dollar Tree, Family Dollar exposed to Dollar Tree, which obviously is the owner of Family Dollar. And I would say about 60%, circa 60% is Family Dollar and the rest of it is either Dollar Tree or the dual banners that they have. There's about, I want to say 3% of the 3.3%. So that's nine basis points of lease expirations over the next two years, 2.5 years that will materialize. So even if there are these closures and even if some of these assets are named on the closing list, our impact is basically nine basis points. And I can assure you that our asset management team is already working on resolutions given that it is part of the pipeline. Anything beyond that will potentially be closed and will remain dark. We are still going to collect rent. And let me tell you that the pressure on Family Dollar and Dollar Tree is going to be a lot more acute than it is on us to try to find a substitute to step in and take over these leases. And just episodically, there's a fair amount of interest in some of these locations that we've received just along the lines of some of the news that's out there about potential closings, et cetera that we feel pretty good about our ability to resolve the Family Dollar assets. The one thing I'll add, which may not be apparent, Family Dollar tends to be in urban areas and in much more densely populated areas than Dollar Tree or Dollar General. And so the attractiveness of those locations to alternative retail clients is a lot more, and that's borne out by the fact that we have received inbound. So for us, this is no different than learning well in advance that, hey, these particular leases are not going to get renewed and it gives us time to work on some of these leases well in advance of the actual lease expiration. So that's how I would frame it. Sure. That's a great question. For us, free cash flow is a massive advantage. The ability to raise $825 million of free cash flow post all obligations is essentially capital that we can use to invest across a variety of areas to accretively grow our earnings. Obviously, when we have free cash flow, we have to figure out what is the best use of that free cash flow. We could buy back our debt, we could buy back our stock, we could continue to invest accretively. And when we find that investing accretively is the best possible use of that capital -- that is a massive advantage. And in a year where we are highlighting the fact that we have $2 billion of acquisitions, and we hope we do better than that, but that's our current guidance. Being able to finance this business with $825 million of free cash flow, which is obviously non-dilutive in nature and grow our earnings is a massive advantage. That's how we think about our free cash flow. There is obviously opportunity cost associated with this. But the way we think about opportunity cost is what's the best use of this capital. And for us, even in this environment, given the platform that we have, and given the diversification benefits of being able to invest across multiple asset types, across multiple geographies, we are continuing to find accretive use of this particular cash flow. And I think, obviously, one of the other things that we do look at is what is the long-term overall return profile. And that is what we compare to our long-term WACC, which is our cost of equity, that 65% and our cost of debt that is 35%. And the cost of equity -- and by the way, we have a few pages on this in our investor deck. It's largely driven by the CAPM model and the dividend growth model. And I think we take the average of the two to come up with our cost effective long-term cost of equity and the long-term cost of debt and it's 65%, 35% weighted. And all of our investments need to meet that hurdle rate and exceed that hurdle rate for us to move forward. So that's really how we think about our cost of capital and how we specifically think about the free cash flow, which obviously we view as a massive advantage to us. We do. Any new development that we are entering into, and I think somebody asked this question as well, we should -- it should be more reflective of the current cost of capital environment. And so as you know, a lot of these developments, they do have a bit of a lag time. And so what you're seeing close today is in that lower 7% ZIP code. But what you should see translate over the next few quarters is to see that cash cap rate continuing to trend much higher, reflecting the current cost of capital. Yes. So a lot of these were retail parks. And let's talk a little bit about retail parks because there's a confusion when you say multi-tenanted, we think in terms of what -- how we define multi-tenanted here in the US. This is not like multi-tenanted here in the US. A lot of these are I would say 80% of them are Tier 1 or Tier 2 as we define them, clients that we are pursuing on a freestanding basis. And they happen to be located in a contiguous part. And each one of these units basically has a flow-through from rent to NOI, very similar to what you would find on a freestanding basis. So the growth in these leases, they tend to be shorter, anywhere between five to 10 years. And the growth in these leases could be open market reviews or they could have some of the larger boxes could have more of the regular way growth that we've seen that are tied to inflation, et cetera. But when we are underwriting these assets, we are looking at the composition of the tenants. We're looking at the flow through. We're looking at are these rents above or below market? We're looking at what the long-term profile of the return is going to be. And then we are comparing it to what are we getting these assets at day one in terms of the initial yield. And these assets have really done very well. And some of the numbers, a lot of the renewals come strong, these retail parks that we bought because the freestanding assets haven't gone through a renewal process yet. And the fact that they are very similar in nature to our overall portfolio of 104.3% that we were able to generate this quarter is a reflection of how we are underwriting each one of these retail parks. But that's where we are seeing the value. And the fact that we are now starting to consolidate and control swaps of retail parks across the UK is a massive advantage for us because the kind of conversations we can have with clients that we've obviously wanted to grow with is very different when we control major locations that they would like to continue to stay over the long duration. And I think that's how we are able to generate the value that we are able to generate. And we are doing it at a time point in time where should be told retail parks are starting to change. If you look at the vacancy that you have, it's circa 2%. If you look at the actual growth that we are being able to generate, it's much higher than what was traditionally achieved. And if you also look at the free rent concept that used to exist, we are being able to compress on that concept, just given the fact that we control so much more of retail parks. So this has been a great investment for us. And I just want to make sure that people realize that the flow-through is very similar to a stand-alone net lease business that we've traditionally been involved in. So I'm glad you asked the question, Anthony. Thank you. Yeah. So look, we've gone through one of them already with Cineworld. AMC represents about 1% of our rent. We have, I believe, 39 assets. AMC continues to be able to raise capital in the equity markets. And 2024 is not going to be a great year for the box office. We recognize that. It may be equivalent to last year, maybe it will be even a little bit less than last year given some of the disruptions that occurred in 2023. But the expectation is that 2025 will supersede 2023 and the quality of movie releases will be much higher in 2025 than in 2024. Is it possible that AMC goes through a BK process? Yes, it's absolutely possible. But I can tell you, our experience on Cineworld gives us a lot of confidence that the assets that we have and the resolutions that we've been able to achieve and the restructuring of the rent that was achieved is still going to create an outcome that is very acceptable to us. Tony, just to put things in perspective, our history, and we've had several bankruptcies in our history, our recapture rate has been north of 80%. And I believe if we were to do the full analysis, once we go full cycle on the Cineworld, it's going to be in that ZIP code. And it's not actually even better than that. given some of the resolutions that we are finding on the vacant asset sales that we had touched on last year on Cineworld. So, I believe AMC is going to be a similar story, but it is not trade comp that they're going to go through a BK process, we believe they have enough liquidity to certainly withstand this year and potentially most of next year as well. But if they were to go through a BK process, it's not necessarily a bad thing. I think it will allow them to restructure the debt, which I think continues to be a massive burden and they will emerge stronger for it. And we believe that, again, just like in the Cineworld situation, we have some of their better assets and we will do fairly well even if they were to go through the BK process. So, that's our thoughts on AMC. Hi Haendel, I'm sorry, it was very difficult to hear you. But I think what you're asking for is, do we expect to accelerate the investments in the latter half of the year given what we are seeing today? And if I didn't quite get that, I apologize. But the answer is, look, we are not trying to look for a particular quantum of acquisitions or investments, we are allowing for the market to dictate how much we'll be able to achieve in a year, which is very uncertain. If you're asking for an opinion, I do believe that especially here in the U.S., the second half of the year, when there is a little bit more clarity in terms of where interest rates are going, et cetera, there will be more opportunities. And Haendel, if you look at what we've been able to achieve over the last few years, we tend to get more than our share of the volume, especially of the product that we are interested in pursuing. And so is it possible that the U.S. acquisition numbers for the remainder of the year is going to be higher than what we achieved in the first quarter, the answer is yes. We certainly do. Do we expect the European momentum to continue? The answer is, yes. Do we expect both these markets to accelerate? The answer is, yes. And I just want to caveat it that this is our opinion, and time will tell. But we feel fairly optimistic about the second half of the year. That was a loaded question, Haendel, but thank you for asking. The number is, I believe, closer to $11 billion. Yes, if we were to spin that business out, it would be one of the largest REITs in the U.K. But that is absolutely not our intention today. We are very happy with having Europe as part of our overall platform precisely for the reasons that we talked about on this call regarding the first quarter. It allows us the opportunity to play in markets where we have the best risk-adjusted return profiles of investments. And therefore, all of that benefit accrues to our shareholders here in the U.S. And so that's how I'm going to leave it. Again, was this a grand design that we would grow up to $10 billion? No. It's again a function of the platform that we brought in, our cost of capital, our team and their ability to execute unlike any other teams and our ability to form the relationships as quickly as we did and now we consider the de facto net lease company in all of Europe. I mean, those are benefits that has taken us five years to establish. And now we feel like is the time for us to continue to harvest the benefits of establishing ourselves in Europe. So that's how I would answer it. Thank you for your question, Nick. Yes, I would say about 6% of our investments in the first quarter went towards the digital JV that we have formed. As you may recall, Nick, that is an asset that is being currently developed in Northern Virginia, in Loudoun County. And it won't be operational until the end of this year, the first phase, maybe -- actually, it's the first quarter of next year. And then there could be the second phase that gets kicked in. So as of right now, that is the only investment that we have on the data center side. There are other opportunities that we are looking at. We do have an investment that we will make, we will continue to make in Spain, that is also looking at a data center side that we believe is very well located, and there seems to be a lot of interest in that particular side. That will be our additional spend on the data center side, but that hasn't been substantial to date. But those are really the only two opportunities that we are looking at. We are obviously involved in multiple conversations with multiple operators to try to understand where the real opportunities are versus the optimism that continues to play out in this particular space. And we are hopeful that we can grow our high percent part of our portfolio in a meaningful way over the next few years. But as of right now, a lot of it is just in the initial stages of conversations with potential operators outside of the JV that we have with digital. On the gaming side, things continue to look interesting. We've obviously made two investments. It represents slightly north of 3% of our rents and we are in conversations with other opportunities, including potential development opportunities in large cities. There's a very long tail to some of these development opportunities. But we'll see how some of these conversations translate into actual transactions. But I will say that there was an interesting conversation we were having earlier this year, which has been kind of put on hold for right now that would be a continued growth of our gaming business, but it hasn't quite materialized yet. So we'll see how that plays out. Yeah, Wes, we continue to look for opportunities on the credit investment side. But please keep in mind that one of the things that's dictating our investments in the credit side is to continue to strengthen relationships with either existing clients or to help facilitate sale leaseback with those existing clients. And if we want to be viewed as a real estate partner to some of the world's leading operators, part of being that partner is to provide capital through the traditional channels that we have established or on a more secured basis to balance sheet lending. And that continues to be how we think about our credit investment. But one of the advantages of doing this Wes, as I'm sure you recognize is this continuous headwinds that we experienced, given the refinancings that we are having to incur at much higher rates. This is a perfect natural hedge to that,, because here we are lending to clients that we have credit exposures to reflective of the current higher interest rate. And that's really part of why we believe that this is such a good strategy for us in the interim, people talk about reinvestment risk. Well, guess what, if the environment is different and interest rates actually go down. We don't have to roll our credit. Our cost of capital should be better. These headwinds that we are facing on our refinancings will dissipate. And we'll be able to, therefore, invest it in more of our traditional sources, this capital that we get back at very good yields. And so really, I think of the credit partly as a defensive mechanism and is a natural hedge to the headwinds that we faced, but also very much in line with trying to become that real estate partner to the world's leading operators, and these are operators with whom we want to continue to grow our relationship. Yeah. We do have software based loans. But by and large, what we try to do is not expose ourselves to the floating rate element. We try to lock it in, we get it but then no longer becomes a perfect hedge. But given where the environment is and given the expectation of interest rates, we are still very well protected. We have one loan, the ASDA loan that was -- it was -- it's a floater and it's off of the SONIA in the UK. But largely, every other loan that we've made has been a fixed component to it. And keep in mind that we also inherited some loans, one of which actually got paid off at 100% that we inherited from Spirit, and it was a $33 million seller financing that Spirit had provided to imagine, which, by the way, was an outcome that was superior to how we had underwritten it. So yeah, it's -- Jonathan, do you want to add something? We are certainly seeing sale-leaseback opportunities. In fact, 13% of what we closed in the first quarter, it was sale-leaseback. But you're right, Harsh. If you compare it to last year, 46% of everything we did was sale leaseback. The year before that, it was closer to 40%. And we are not seeing that. And I think part of it is because clients are trying to figure out ways to not necessarily lock into 20-year, 25-year leases at these elevated cap rates. And so if there is an alternative available to them, be it through the debt markets, which has much shorter duration, even if it is higher, I think they're going to be far more inclined to doing that. But I just want to be very clear that we are -- again, if it's a brand-new client that we don't have a relationship with, we are not going to go and provide them credit if there isn't a compelling sale-leaseback opportunity with them and our desire to have them as part of our client registry is not there. We are not going to be pure credit providers like some of the credit funds out there that exist. So, I do see that changing as there is stability in the rate environment, as people start to get much more comfortable about where things are going to sort of play out, I do believe that sale-leaseback will come roaring back. We are in discussions with some names right now. And it really is a disconnect between where they want to transact and what -- where we are capable of transacting given our cost of capital. So -- but I think it's a matter of time. Thank you, Harsh. Yes. That's where the secret sauce is, Linda. But all right. Let me -- and I don't want to get to pedantic, so try to keep it pretty high level. The way our predictive analytics were it is by industry and even at times by client. But largely, the models work by industry. And it tries to identify the key variables, which could be 20, 30, 40 variables that dictate the predictability of a renewal outcome or a leasing outcome. So the pieces around how we created the predictive analytic tool was to figure out, what was our leasing activity going to look like, where will we -- the risk was defined as, are we going to be able to maintain the rent that we currently have during a renewal period? Or are we -- is it going to go less? Or is it going to be more -- and that's how we define risk, and that's how we've sort of created these algorithms by industry to identify where does risk lie in our portfolio. And as you can imagine, each industry has its own set of variables that dictate that particular outcome. But the biggest piece of all of this. I think the creation of the algorithms, et cetera, is a fairly simple task. I mean it's taken us 3.5, four years. So I don't want to minimize that piece. I've got me looking at me strangely here. But it is the data that we have that allowed us to back test these models and continue to refine and calibrate these models to improve their predictability. I think that's what is whether the true value lies in our platform, having been around for 50 years. And I think that's why you see the kind of results that you see when we are posting the release -- the re-leasing spreads, when we are trying to get ahead in terms of identification of assets that we should, where we are maximizing the return profile of those assets given what we think will happen some lease renewal. I think that's where the predictive analytics tools, along with the asset management team was using on-the-ground experience to sort of share their perspective along with the credit view, that group together is what's dictating how we try to stay ahead with the portfolio. And it's -- it has to be tools driven. It has to be technology driven. When you have 15,400 discrete locations with in 80 different industries with 1,500 different clients I mean it can't be done manually. And so that's the reason why we chose to make this investment Linda, five years ago and several millions in -- this is a tool that we are very, very proud of. And it's now very much part and parcel of every decision we are making. Be it acquisitions, be it disposition, the hold decisions and also, this tool is now being used to dictate the highest and best use for potential vacancies, which may or may not be the old use of that particular asset. And we've seen some of the value creation that, that prediction has yielded for us as a platform. So hopefully, I didn't get too much into the details, but that's really how the pretty expanded tool works Yes. For us, having geographical diversification, the advantages of it played out in the first quarter, right? I mean you saw we were able to find transactions in the UK that had a return profile that far superseded what we are able to find here in the US. And then that will flip, so I think the geographical diversity is a good thing. In terms of the actual composition of the portfolio, we clearly have what we are viewing as an optimal portfolio. And an optimal portfolio, we might like, let's call it, grocery. But we want grocery to be 13% to 14% of our overall portfolio. If that creeps into the 19% to 20%, that's not a good thing. And by the way, I'm giving you an example, that's not the case, grocery happens to be only 10% of our portfolio today. And then there are other areas like apparel that we may not necessarily want to be exposed to at all. But again, using very broad brushes across particular subsectors is not the right answer either. And that's the reason why this tool along with credit, et cetera, they help us devise what we believe to be the optimal portfolio. If you think retail and you step back, we like service-oriented businesses. We like low price point businesses. And -- that's sort of the overarching nondiscretionary overarching elements that we look for on the retail side. That doesn't mean that we won't deviate from this. But over 90% of our retail portfolio, by the way, has one or more of these characteristics. But that's, I think, how you think about the composition and geographical diversification is something that sits on top of that. Thank you all for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking soon and seeing you at the upcoming conferences. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Sumit. It's been a quiet start to the year on the capital markets front, following our January US dollar bond offering, which raised $1.25 billion in gross proceeds at a blended yield to maturity of approximately 5.14%. As introduced in our prior earnings call, our financing strategy for 2024 does not require incremental capital to finance our growth and acquisition needs. This continues to be the case at our current investment guidance. To that end, we had another quarter with a net debt and preferred equity, annualized pro forma adjusted EBITDA ratio of 5.5 times, that's in line with our target ratio. During the quarter, we settled approximately $550 million of equity previously raised through our ATM program, and which was outstanding on a forward basis. This leaves us with approximately $63 million of outstanding equity available for future settlements. And when combined with approximately $825 million of annualized free cash flow available to us following the Spirit merger, and the disposition program that Sumit referenced, our $2 billion investment guidance for the year is one, we believe can be funded without having to tap the markets. Our debt maturity schedule for the remainder of the year is modest, with approximately $469 million of remaining maturities, excluding $342 million of short-term commercial paper and revolver borrowings and of cash. As always, we look to maintain significant financial flexibility to fund known and identified liquidity and with approximately $4 billion of total liquidity available to us and minimal variability debt exposure on the balance sheet, we believe we can refinance these maturities while still retaining significant liquidity headroom and keeping ydebt exposure well below 10% of our debt capital stack through the balance of the year. With that, I'll turn it back over to Sumit for closing remarks. Hey, Farrell, on the bad debt number, so we did disclose in the earnings press release for Q1, it was about $1.4 million that we actually recognized. As we think about forward-looking guidance and downside scenarios. I think we've been pretty clear in the past that we've been extremely conservative. I think when you sit here today, it's early May, it's a long time to go before the end of the year -- it's not to say that there's any major concerns. I think you heard some talk about the watch list and it's a bunch of small little things that if everything when a yes, maybe could have some impact, but it's certainly not our expected scenario on that front. And so I think it's really a mix of spirits assets that we did acquire that we've always been a little bit more cautious on, and we'll continue to be cautious until we get further into the year. I think for us, we're always pretty conservative as it relates to bad debt expense, especially early in the year. And then finally, there's some identified credits that even more or coating on. Yes. Well, just to add to that, when we think about it in a natural hedge, I think it's more so a lot of lines of lenders that actually matures, because we look at our maturity schedule, we've got a decent amount of debt coming to well staggered, but on a nominal basis, still pretty significant, $1.9 billion next year, for instance, or $3.26 billion at almost $3 billion in 2027. And so when you have a corresponding asset that could get cold or will get repaid and it's hard to replace that coupon in a lower rate environment, chances are we're much better off as we're refinancing our liabilities and our cost of capital is obviously much lower. So I think that's another way to take through the natural hedge element."
