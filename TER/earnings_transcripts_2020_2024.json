At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to Mr. Andy Blanchard, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nAndy Blanchard: Thank you, Sharon. Good morning everyone, and welcome to our discussion of Teradyne's most recent financial results. I'm joined for our discussion this morning by Teradyne's CEO, Mark Jagiela; and our CFO, Sanjay Mehta. Following our opening remarks, we'll provide details of our performance for 2020's fourth quarter and full-year along with our outlook for the first quarter of 2021. The press release [containing our] results was issued last evening. We're providing slides on the Investor page of the website that may be helpful to you in following the discussion. Replay of this call will be available via the same page after the call ends. The matters that we discuss today will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause Teradyne's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statements contained in the earnings release, as well as our most recent SEC filings. Additionally, those forward-looking statements are made as of today and we take no obligation to update them as a result of developments occurring after this call. During today's call, we'll make reference to non-GAAP financial measures. We\u2019ve posted additional information concerning these non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, where available on the Investor page of our website.  Looking ahead between now and our next earnings call, Teradyne would be participating in technology or industrial focused Investor Conferences hosted by Goldman Sachs, Citi, and Susquehanna. Now, let's get on with the rest of the agenda. First, Mark, will comment on our recent results and the market conditions as we enter the new year. Sanjay will then offer more details on our quarterly results, along with our guidance for the first quarter. We\u2019ll then answer your questions. And this call is scheduled for one hour. Mark?\nMark Jagiela: Good morning and thanks for joining us. In our call today, I\u2019ll summarize our Q4 and 2020 full-year highlights and provide some initial comments on our outlook for 2021. Sanjay will then provide the financial details, Q1 outlook, and review our updated earnings model and capital allocation plans. Fourth quarter capped off an amazing year for Teradyne with sales up 16% from the fourth quarter of 2019, and non-GAAP earnings per share up 25%. That brought our full-year sales to just over 3.1 billion, up 36% and non-GAAP EPS to $4.62, up 62% versus 2019. These annual results, driven by strength in all of our test businesses, more than made up for a soft industrial automation market that was impacted by COVID. For the full-year, our SemiTest business was especially strong driven by investments in smartphone related test capacity, our expansion into the compute sector of SOC with our new UltraFLEXplus product, and the ramp of our Magnum EPIC product for DRAM test. In smartphones, global unit shipments contracted in 2020, but the growth in chipset complexity continued driving tester demand higher. Each subsystem on the phone, cellular power management, conductivity, display, cameras, and application processing has its own cycle. And in 2020 both the processor and the cellular areas took big steps up in complexity. We use transistor count as a proxy for complexity and the leading phone applications processors now exceed 10 billion transistors, growing double-digits each generation. In 2020, we also saw the beginning of meaningful 5G silicon content, which necessitated a build-out of new tester capacity. Together these lifted the mobility test market in 2020, roughly $200 million to about 1.7 billion. This continuous refresh of smartphone silicon should be a tailwind for the semiconductor test business for the foreseeable future. In 2020, we also ramped our UltraFLEXplus product in the compute portion of the SOC market.  Recall, this has historically been a $500 million to $600 million market, where we've had relatively low share. With the emergence of more players and applications in the processor market, including hyper scalars and AI, we expect this sector to outgrow the general market. The plus, brings a powerful value proposition in managing the unique complexity, power dynamics, yield learning, and time to market requirements of this segment. For 2020, we estimate the SOC market was in the range of $3.4 billion to $3.5 billion, up from about $3.3 billion in 2019. We estimate our SOC test market share moved up 15 points to about 54%. However, our internal view of share smooths out year-on-year swings due to the unique timing of investment cycles of both our and our competitors\u2019 customers. By that measure, we estimate our normalized 2020 SOC share at about 50%. Another notable growth segment of our SemiTest business in 2020 was memory. In this call, a year ago, we noted a significant design win for Magnum EPIC product and LPDDR5 portion of the DRAM market. This new entry into DRAM test ramped through the year and combined with healthy growth in our [traditional band business], drove a 41% increase in memory sales from 2019. We estimate the market was about $900 million in 2020, up from $600 million in 2019, and our normalized 2020 memory share at about 42%. Beyond SemiTest, our System Test Group also had a great year delivering 43% growth, with the storage test business more than doubling from 2019. This is the second consecutive year of hyper growth and storage test driven by steady test intensity growth of terabyte HDD drives and similar growth in the system level test of complex semiconductor devices. In our wireless test business at light point sales grew by 10% from 2019 with solid demand from both our conductivity and cellular end markets. WiFi 6, ultra-wideband test, and increased investments in 5G related handset tests all contributed. The performance of our test businesses more than offset the weaker results in our industrial automation business, which contracted 6% for the year. The global slowdown in manufacturing activity led to a 12% decline in sales at our Universal Robots unit. MiR on the other hand grew 1% as makers of ultraviolet disinfecting products recognize the value of an easier to deploy fully autonomous mobile robot. On a pro forma basis, auto guide also grew for the year. While the environment in IAA was weaker than expected, the business troughed in the second quarter of 2020 and has improved dramatically in the second half, including record sales at UR in the fourth quarter. Collectively, the businesses returned to year-over-year growth in Q4 with UR growing 6% year-over-year and 41% sequential growth. With tests showing continued strength and industrial automation returning to growth we are set up for another exciting year in 2021. Specifically, we are expecting a strong start to the year across all our businesses with Q1 showing greater than 6% growth at the midpoint, compared to Q1 of 2020. As you know, full-year visibility is always a challenge as evidenced by our missing the strength of the test market and the decline of the IAA market and our forecast just one-year ago. That said, let me describe how we see things today. And of course we'll keep you updated in future calls. I will preface my remarks with a note that the well publicized surge in the forecasted semiconductor CapEx in 2021 is a very bullish sign. However, the impact on test is likely to be felt in 2020 and beyond as fab capacity built this year will drive additional testers in future years aligned to fab commissioning and ramping volumes and yields. In SOC test, the dynamics that made 2020 such a strong year continue into 2021. In addition, we have strengthening demand in the long dormant automotive test market with orders for our Eagle test product lines surging. Smartphone shipments are expected to grow in 2021 after contracting about 10% in 2020 and 5G content should increase. On the other hand, the SOC test market in China will likely be down in 2021 due to the expanded and full-year effects of trade restrictions that were widened in 2020. Also, as always, tester demand from our largest customer will remain opaque until sometime in Q2. Additionally, the global economic impact of COVID and its impact on electronics demand after a surge in 2020, it's hard to forecast with the arguments for both positive and negative effects. Taking all of that into account, we have a bit wider range in our SOC market size estimate for 2021 at 3.3 billion to 3.8 billion, up slightly from 2020 at the midpoint. In memory tests, the transition to LPDDR-5 and DDR5 should gain momentum in 2021 and beyond. After growing about 50% in 2020, we view the memory market to be in the $800 billion to $1 billion range in 2021, about even with 2020 at the midpoint. In storage tests, the underlying demand drivers of increased density and HDD, and increased complexity and semi devices driving system level tests remain in place. However, visibility is limited and annual shipments can be very lumpy. After more than tripling over the last three years, we expect 2021 sales to be in a band of plus or minus 20% from the 2020 level. For the rest of our test businesses, we expect growth in the 5% to 10% range in 2021. In Industrial Automation, 2021 is starting off on a strong footing. Barring any additional COVID-related manufacturing sector shutdowns, we expect to deliver the highest ever first quarter sales in each of our automation businesses and we are well-positioned to grow in excess of 30% for the year. 2020s results reflect well on Teradyne\u2019s strategy, execution, and efficiency. Our test businesses show the successful results of R&D bets made in years past and enable us to increase those bets for the future. Our Industrial Automation investments continue undeterred by short-term impacts of COVID, and we are well-positioned to capitalize on a world emerging to invest even more in automation to improve resilience and productivity. Equally significant, 2020 showed the resilience of Teradyne employees, our global suppliers, and our operating model. In the face of unimaginable challenges across communities worldwide, the team dealt with health, safety, and operation obstacles daily, met R&D milestones, executed steep new product ramps, and delivered record shipments of SOC, memory, and storage text products to meet our customer\u2019s needs. We get all this while exercising the cost and schedule discipline expected to Teradyne. This is truly extraordinary, and I'm very grateful to be part of such a powerful team. As we move into 2021, the outlook appears bright across all our markets. As Sanjay will detail, we are returning to our share repurchase program and have an active M&A pipeline. As 2020 taught us, no matter what comes our way in the short-term, I am confident our global team and market strategy will deliver exciting long-term returns for our customers, investors, and employees. Sanjay will now take you through the financial and modeling details. Sanjay?\nSanjay Mehta: Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Today I'll cover the financial highlights of Q4 and review the financial details of 2020. Looking forward, I'll provide our Q1 outlook. An update to our mid-term earnings model and our capital allocation plans. Now to Q4, revenues were $759 million, which were $19 million above the high-end of the guidance range. We delivered a non-GAAP operating profit of 30% and EPS of $1.10. SemiTest revenue of $524 million was driven by SOC and memory test demand enabling 5G handsets and higher speed flash and DRAM devices. System Test Group had revenue of $104 million down quarter-over-quarter driven by lower storage test shipments. Industrial Automation or IA, revenue of $92 million had a seasonal increase over Q3 and delivered year-over-year growth for the first time in 2020. LitePoint revenue of $40 million was approximately flat with Q3, and down year-over-year with a decline in trailing edge conductivity products, partially offset by new sales of new conductivity technology like WiFi 6 and emerging UWB technology. Non-GAAP gross margins were 59% on plan and quarter-over-quarter due to product mix. You'll see our non-GAAP operating expenses were up 14 million to $224 million from the third quarter, due to increased test spending to support design wins, higher payroll, due to four extra days in the quarter, and ongoing IA investments. We generated $222 million in free cash in the fourth quarter. The tax rate, excluding discrete items for the quarter was 13% on a GAAP basis and 14.5% on a non-GAAP basis. For the full-year it is 14.75% on a GAAP basis, and 15.25% on a non-GAAP basis. We ended the year with cash and marketable securities of $1.55 billion. Turning to the full-year results of 2020, Teradyne revenues of $3.12 billion grew $826 million, or 36% year-over-year. $845 million of the growth was from our test portfolio, while IA contracted $18 million, due to the pandemic related slowdown. We had one customer that accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in 2020, which we'll disclose in our 10-K filing. Gross margins for the year were 57%, and operating profit was 30%, which is up from 25% in 2019. Non-GAAP EPS was $4.62, an increase of 62% over 2019. We generated $684 million in free cash in 2020. Breaking down the components of 2020 revenues, as outlined by Mark, SOC test revenues grew $595 million or 46% on strength and mobility, market driven by increase by device complexity and new standards like 5G along with growth in computing. In memory, revenues were $383 million, up 41%. While LPDDR related DRAM revenues were a significant contributor to our results, we also continue to see strong NAND test demand through the year. In system test, sales grew for the fourth year running. Revenue of $410 million grew $122 million or 43% year-over-year, primarily on growth and storage test for both hard disk drive and system level test. Storage test sales were $242 million, up from $115 million in 2019. We also saw annual growth in our defense and aerospace components of STG. At LitePoint sales grew for the fourth consecutive year to $173 million, 10% above 2019. In 2020, IA revenue was $280 million, a decline of 6% from 2019 on an as reported basis, or 9% on a pro forma basis.  As Mark noted, the COVID related driven slowdown in manufacturing impacted Universal Robots, reducing revenue to $219 million, down 12% year-over-year. After troughing in Q2, UR grew in the second half 2020 versus the first half of the year. In Q4, revenue grew 6% year-over-year, giving confidence heading into 2021. MiR grew slightly year-over-year, with annual sales of $45 million and AutoGuide full-year sales grew on a pro forma basis.  Now to our outlook for Q1. Sales are expected to be between $720 million and $780 million. Non-GAAP EPS range of $0.95 to $1.11 on 179 million diluted shares. The first quarter guidance excludes amortization of acquired intangibles, and the non-cash imputed interest on convertible debt. First quarter gross margins are estimated at 58% to 59%. First quarter OpEx running at 29% to 31% of first quarter sales is about flat with Q4 at the midpoint of guidance.  The non-GAAP operating profit rate at the midpoint of our first quarter guidance is 29%. Regarding our OpEx plans for 2021, we expect our OpEx to grow 8% to 10% from 2020\u2019s $840 million. Approximately two points of the spend will be in the back half of the year related to travel, which we expect to resume to pre-COVID levels along with trade shows. In our test portfolio, we plan to increase our spending in engineering, sales and marketing, primarily in SemiTests. In IA, we\u2019ll continue to invest to reinforce our competitive product and ecosystem position across the sector. Also in IA, go-to-market investments will be made to support expected revenue growth. Turning to capital expenditures. In 2020, our CapEx was $185 million. This was used primarily for customer demonstration equipment, operations, engineering, and initial spending on new facilities to replace leased ones in locations where we plan to grow over the next several years. We'll continue to invest in these new facilities in 2021. So, CapEx is expected to be similar to 2020. Recall, we're buying land and developing it to eliminate lease costs and enable a more efficient spend profile over the mid-to-long term. 2021 GAAP tax rate is estimated at 15.5%, and our non-GAAP tax rate is estimated at 16% based on current tax laws. Moving to our mid-term earnings model. As you've seen with 2020, our non-GAAP of $4.62, we've exceeded our 2022 earnings model two years early on the strength of our test businesses. We continue to have confidence in the long-term growth outlook for test and we expect IA to return to high growth as the global industrial economy improves. When building our midterm model, given our year-on-year demand swings, we've seen both in [test and IA], we use the average of 2019 and 2020 revenues as the baseline for our growth projections. From that baseline, we expect test revenue to grow 4% to 8% compounded and IA revenues to grow 20% to 35% through 2024. In test, we expect that growth will be driven by steady increase in device complexity across our businesses, along with the high-single-digit semiconductor unit growth trend line, In IA, market penetration of cobots and autonomous mobile robots and forklifts remains low, while the range of applications they economically serve continues to expand, resulting in an attractive long-term growth opportunity for Teradyne. We expect this will drive 2024 company revenue to $3.9 billion and non-GAAP EPS to $6 at the mid-point of our estimates. Gross margin is modeled at 58% to 59%, OpEx as a percentage of sales will decline to 28% to 29%, and non-GAAP operating margin will improve to 30% to 31%. The model assumes the current tax laws are in place.  Shifting to capital allocation. We\u2019ll continue to balance a strong cash position to support our operating investments and potential M&A with direct shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases. We are raising our minimum cash levels from 1 billion to 1.25 billion, with the $250 million increase tied to the increased valuations of potential acquisitions.  Recall, we held $500 million for M&A and $500 million for severe economic downturn. We will also be increasing our cash balance in 2021 through 2023 to service our convertible bond, which comes due in December 2023. To date, $51 million of that bond has been redeemed early, with payment planned in Q1, with the remaining face value of $409 million. Regarding share repurchases, in 2020, we bought back 1.5 million shares for $88 million at an average price of $58.32. Recall, we suspended our share repurchase program in April due to COVID-related uncertainty. We are replacing our prior approved program with a new share repurchase authorization of $2 billion with no fixed end date. We plan a minimum of $600 million of repurchases in 2021. As in the past, the plan has both programmatic and opportunistic components. In summary, 2020 inflicted incredible human and economic hardship on the society across [the globe] and we\u2019re respectful of the widespread pain and loss. When the pandemic hit, I noted our priorities were the safety of our employees, supporting our customers, continued execution, and achieving our financial objectives. The Teradyne community responded with a collaborative and supportive spirit, incredible energy, ingenuity, and purpose, which delivered on all three of these priorities. I'm incredibly proud and thankful to be part of this team. We enter 2021 in the strongest position in our history. The work in 2020 has made us more resilient and prepared us for the strong market demand that we currently see in both test and IA. While our visibility for the full-year is limited. We're confident in the underlying market fundamentals, our competitive diversified portfolio, and our team which will enable long-term growth prospects for the markets we serve. Collectively, we're excited to turn our new financial model into reality.  With that, I'll turn things back to Andy.\nAndy Blanchard: Thanks, Sanjay. Operator, we would now like to take some questions and as a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Krish Sankar with Cowen.\nKrish Sankar: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Mark, I have two of them. First one, thanks for the color on calendar 2021. I'm just kind of curious if you could [peel] the SOC test market a little more to say, how much do you think mobility will be and how much do you think auto test would be this year on SOC? And then I have a follow up.\nMark Jagiela: Yeah. So, good question. Certainly auto is going to be up sequentially in 2020. We've talked about that market being at a normalized, let's say maybe more of a peak run rate in the $400 million to $500 million range, it's been sort of 200 million last year. So, this year that should be up at least 150 million, maybe 200 million. It's really right now a bit of a rush for capacity. And we don't know exactly when the demand profile of orders are going to taper off here. So, it could go higher if this persists. So that's the color on auto. In mobility, I think it's harder for us to see that at the moment because of the significant impact of our largest customer on both us in the market, which doesn't really become solidified until April-ish of the year. So, we're looking at it, sort of, flat plus or minus $100 million in mobility.\nKrish Sankar: Got it, got it. That\u2019s very helpful Mark. And then just as a follow up on the IA side, you mentioned [30% plus] growth, should we assume a big driver of that is going to be UR? In other words, UR should be higher than 30% or do you think UR is going to be in-line with Industrial Automation growth?\nMark Jagiela : Yeah, I think \u2013 that's a good question. I think all other groups are going to be better than 30. And some of them like AutoGuide are small, so I think they'll pull up the average, be ahead of UR and MiR UR should be about the same for the year.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Thank you very much, Mark.\nMark Jagiela: Okay.\nOperator: Next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Just want to go back to your SOC commentary. I'm a little bit surprised with your, kind of flattish outlook. And I say that because millimeter wave is expected to account for a larger mix of 5G phones, and I believe last year was just the early investment. So, why isn't the increased penetration of millimeter wave phone not giving you that incremental confidence? And I have a follow up.\nMark Jagiela: Yeah, I think that's certainly a balloon for the year Mehdi. You know, maybe we're going to double the number of millimeter wave enabled phones in 2021, but yes, last year, if you recall, there was also a significant step up in the hundreds of millions of units of millimeter wave enabled phones were brought to market last year. So, if you add another 200 million to 300 million additional millimeter wave enabled units this year, and let's say that brings the global total to 600 million units out of 1.4 billion, you're essentially adding about as much capacity maybe a little bit more, because there'll be more than let's say last year, added 250, this year might add 350 million units. So yes, there will be a little bit of growth in additional millimeter wave test capacity. But last year was a pretty big year too.\nMehdi Hosseini: Got it. And then looking at the mid-term model 2024, what are the key underlying assumption for market share, especially as you try to capitalize on the synergies between semi and a system test? And in that context, are you accounting for any incremental share shift in the GPU end market?\nSanjay Mehta: Yeah, hi, Mehdi, it's Sanjay. Yeah, so in the earnings model, we see obviously growth in the market. As Mark alluded to, you know, more players are coming into the compute space that we can address. And with that, we feel that with the UltraFLEXplus solution we're very well-positioned, and we are projecting share growth. When we think about from a memory perspective, you know if you go back, let's say 10 years, you know, we've been on this steady increase of memory share growth, where as we continue to execute, we see continued share growth on that perspective as well. So, really growth in market size, as well as continued share growth are our drivers.\nMehdi Hosseini: That includes the synergy between different sectors or segments?\nSanjay Mehta : You want to expand on that question?\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes. Just going back to the question, I see opportunities between your semi and the system test, especially as the system level test diversifies. And I'm just wondering if that's baked into your 2024 model?\nSanjay Mehta : Yeah. Okay. Thanks for the clarification. Yes, it is. You know, with device complexity we're going 5 nanometer and then to 3 nanometer. I think both system level test, as well as ATE test take that into account.\nMehdi Hosseini: Got it. Thank you so much for detail.\nOperator: Next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.\nToshiya Hari: Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the question. Mark, I wanted to ask about your largest customer, I appreciate, you know, things will remain pretty fuzzy or opaque, as you said, until sort of the April-ish timeframe, but can you sort of walk us through the potential range of outcomes you're thinking internally? And obviously you've got units, you've got, you know transistor density as it relates to the new chip. Also curious if there are efforts on the notebooks out of their business, in-sourcing CPUs, could have an impact on your business as well? And then I've got a quick follow up. Thank you.\nMark Jagiela: Okay, you know, I always am a bit reluctant to be too specific on any one customer. So, I'm going to speak more to the segment, a bit, which I'll bundle compute and mobility together here. So, last year was incredibly strong in both our traditional mobility market because of the complexity growth of phones, which we alluded to, and the fact that we did enter compute as a new segment. So, we ended up with additional revenues in compute last year that, you know, north of $50 million for the first year in that market. So, as we think about this year, the issue of smartphone unit growth and complexity growth of the apps processor, the camera systems and such in the phones is part of the equation, and we have a reasonably good read on that. On the compute side, there's a lot of moving parts there. And there's a lot \u2013 since it's a new market for us and a new market for some of our customers that has the bigger range of potential outcomes for the year. You know, so that's the one we're triangulating on. That could be up significantly over last year. It could be up modestly over last year, but at this point, we really can't be too specific.\nToshiya Hari: Got it. Thank you for the color. And then as a quick follow up, on industrial automation, I wanted to ask about, you know, the profit margin profile of the business, you know, where does it stand today, I guess as of 2020? You guys have done a great job in improving gross margin at UR and the other businesses that you've acquired over the past couple of years, and at the same time, you've been aggressively spending from an OpEx perspective. So, in your 2024 model, what sort of margin profile for IA is embedded in your numbers? Thank you.\nSanjay Mehta: Yeah, hi it\u2019s Sanjay. So, IA as a whole this year was roughly just a bit better than breakeven. Obviously, with the COVID impact on multiple businesses, and the contraction in UR, you know, we're just above breakeven, but you know, fundamentally, we continue to invest in the portfolio, the ecosystem, the go to market for product and differentiation, ease of implementation. And so you should expect that to continue over the mid-term and, you know we're focused on driving the revenue growth and the investments. And so, with that we expect the margin profile to be roughly consistent with the current profile, as we \u2013 as AutoGuide is relatively new to the organization, just over a year. We expect that to, you know improve with our, you know our Teradyne supply chain, as well as other quality processes we step in.\nToshiya Hari: Thank you.\nMark Jagiela: Just one thing, I\u2019m going to add on to that commentary around the industrial automation business to remind people that what we focus on right now during the high growth phase of that business is sales growth and gross margin. And the bottom line, as Sanjay mentioned, if we're at breakeven, we're happy as long as we can sort of adhere to or exceed the Rule of 40. And through the mid-term, we think we expect to be close to that kind of up top line growth rates. And what we bring down to the bottom line will, kind of depend on the size of the growth, what we see ahead of us. And if we're growing at 50% and breakeven, we're happy as [indiscernible] and if the growth rates come down below 20%, we'll start dropping more and more down to the bottom line.\nToshiya Hari: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.\nJoe Moore: Great, thank you. Following on the last question, can you just characterize the tone of business for the Universal Robotics business? And I guess in the context of, you know, it feels like a lot of the business activity in the last 12 months is business continuity and supply chain disruption. Maybe that's negative for new technologies in manufacturing. At the same time, I would think social distancing and stuff like that is an opportunity for you to just kind of characterize those puts intakes and just, you know what that tells you about what the trends may look like over the course of this year?\nSanjay Mehta : Yeah, sure. It's Sanjay here. So, you know, in the short run we actually saw a contraction as evidenced by, you know, how our revenues were. However, I think your comments hit home with regards to plant and warehouse decision makers seeking to build resilience into their supply chains. And we view that over the mid-term as a tailwind. We are seeing, we are seeing the market obviously come back with Universal Robots. We've talked in our prepared remarks about the automotive and electronics industry, and then we're also seeing strength in a couple of other verticals.\nJoe Moore: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore.\nC.J. Muse: Yeah, hi, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow up on Mehdi\u2019s question regarding your 2024 model. So, if I look at your implied SemiTest revenues versus 2020 actual, you're up about 250 million to 350 million, which seems conservative, particularly when you reflect on, you know, what you're doing with system level test, new UltraFLEXplus. So, can you, I guess walk through, you know, what assumptions you're making in terms of market share for both SOC and memory implied in that number? And, you know, where you might, you know, point to as areas that might be conservative?\nSanjay Mehta : Yeah, I think that, you know, as I articulated from \u2013 I'll touch on memory first, you know, our share right now, [is in the] low 40s, you know, we see that \u2013 we could see that growing to the mid-40s in the plan, and then from an SOC perspective, Mark talked about our normalized share level of about 50%. And we see that increasing over the mid-term.\nC.J. Muse : But within the implied model, are you assuming the 50% or the 60%, that Mark spoke about back in July as to, you know, what a goal could look like?\nSanjay Mehta: So, yeah, I think what we've been saying C.J. is that we can get about a point to a point and a half a share growth a year. So, by 2024, as I mentioned, I think our normalized share is somewhere around 50, we should be up around 55, 56 by then in SOC. And in memory, share moves a little chunkier, because there's only a few players there. So, on the memory side, you know we could be in the mid-to-upper mid-40s by then, I would say, is one way to think about it. But the other piece of color in terms of aggressive versus conservative that I'd add here is, the recent investment profile of the front-end with CapEx moving up into the $70 billion range is something we haven't modeled into our mid-term plan. We've assumed that incremental fab capacity across the mid-term would be sort of consistent with the rate that it's been added for the prior four years. So, if $70 billion plus of investment in [WFE] is the new normal for the next four years, that's certainly going to drive more tests than we model.\nC.J. Muse: Very helpful. As my follow up, can you speak to what we should be thinking about for SOC test gross margins here in 2021 versus 2020? Trying to get a sense of what uplift might look like, particularly from Eagle test?\nSanjay Mehta: I mean, gross margins, we \u2013 you should expect are relatively consistent with how we've guided Q1 in our long-term model.\nC.J. Muse: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Brian Chin with Stifel.\nBrian Chin: Hi there. Good morning. Thanks for letting us ask a few questions. Maybe the first question that comes up is our industrial automation. Automotive has historically been a key portion of sales here and I was curious, do you expect or even need the auto portion of your sales to grow 30% year-over-year, given sort of the increasing breadth of market adoption that you might be seeing?\nSanjay Mehta: Yeah, I think that, you know with an emerging market, there's still a lot of footprint to cover. So, we expect that to continue in the automotive vertical, as well as electronics and industrials, as well as other verticals.\nBrian Chin: Okay. Yeah, I was just sort of trying to gauge whether you're seeing a lot of adoption outside of auto, and you know, in terms of visibility, you're starting the year with pretty good visibility. Is Auto kind of starting from a similar point, or is it kind of a little bit more than the [whole of the start of] the year, and you're going to expect a bigger snapback later in the year? \nSanjay Mehta: Yeah, we're seeing also \u2013 we're seeing market drivers and verticals, adoption, and education, R&D, pharma, as well as Life Sciences, but from a starting point, obviously, we have a very strong incumbent installed base over the years that we've built in the auto vertical.\nMark Jagiela: And I\u2019d just add to that, that certainly automotive was one of the most hard hit aspects of URs business. You know, automotive has been running in the high 30s, 40% of the business coming into 2020 that contracted dramatically because of COVID, down, you know, to the point that it was in the low-20s. And I would say it's certainly at this point, although back and growing it hasn't come back yet to where it should be in our portfolio.  As issues around the semiconductor supply chain and other things have sort of crimped some of the ambitions of car companies to ramp volumes here, there's a little bit to go still. But our footprint over time since we acquired UR has been reducing in the automotive segment, not so much because automotive is not growing, of course, but it's just that our expansion into the other areas that Sanjay mentioned has been and we expect over time, that automotive component will continue to decline as a percentage of our sales.\nBrian Chin: Great, yeah, I was sort of getting maybe at that and then in the 2024 model, [indiscernible] four years out, but can you give us sort of a rough sense of how much of the [IA sales might be AMR] or mobile vehicle driven? I think the split, roughly is kind of 80% UR, 20% mobile at the moment, could that be sort of like a two-thirds one-third in that timeframe?\nSanjay Mehta: Yeah, I think that obviously, UR we've had for a little bit longer. And it is a larger percentage, but I think you're spot on that the AMR portion will grow with AutoGuide and MiR as a percentage of revenue.\nBrian Chin: Okay, great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Next question comes from Atif Malik with Citi.\nAtif Malik: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions and good job on results in guide. Mark, the first one, following up on the last question AutoGuide, how is the adoption going at larger enterprises and warehouse customers? And then I have a follow up.\nMark Jagiela: Yes. Good question. So, to be frank with you, we had a good year. We grew, you know, 50-ish percent in the year, but we didn't hit our target. And part of this is extended evaluations that the larger accounts that you're referencing, and it's been very difficult in a small business like AutoGuide\u2019s case in a COVID area to acquire new customers and get the pilot production validation work done in the same timeframe that we could have gotten it done in a non-COVID world. So, we've seen some extension of those [eval], but we're in the some of the boutique name brands for [evals] that you would hope we are in both the industrial manufacturing side, as well as the e-commerce side and logistics side of life. So, we're hoping that this year is going to be the big breakout year. It's the kind of business that should at least be doubling, if not more, once these big accounts latch, but we did \u2013 if any place sort of had a big impact from COVID last year, it was AutoGuide because of the whole, you know, new customer acquisition is the whole game there at this point.\nAtif Malik: Great. And then as a follow up, you mentioned the China SOC test to be down this year, which makes sense given the restriction from last year, but some of the front-end peers have talked about maybe flattish China investments on the front-end and back-end is different. Can you just walk us through the components on where China investments are down and why you aren't benefiting on some of the mature technologies and nodes?\nMark Jagiela: Yeah. So, if you look at China, I think you need to separate memory and SOC, because it's quite different. On the memory side, there will be growth in China this year in test as well. And we \u2013 or we expect that at least. And so that's a healthy growing mid-term profile, I'd say for China. On SOC, it's really a little bit more difficult to see growth occurring this year. Because the impact of the trade restrictions on Huawei and HiSilicon are tremendous in terms of their buying power in the market historically. What they buy in both silicon and then test capacity for that silicon has been severely hampered. And then further restrictions on other companies like SMIC and such are much smaller factors, but are headwinds against growth. So, I think SOC is likely to contract, memory is going to grow, but net-net, you know, it's not going to be hugely down, but it'll probably be done a little bit on the test side of life.\nAtif Malik : Thanks.\nOperator: Next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. I have two, one on operating leverage, and the second on M&A. On operating leverage, Sanjay, I believe you mentioned OpEx growth of 8% to 10% this year, do you think there is a potential to still drive leverage with that kind of growth? And then when I look at your 2024 model, you're keeping operating margins at, you know about 30%, 31%, kind of where you are already, even though sales are expected to grow and Mark had outlined a number of interesting growth drivers. So, I was hoping you could talk to operating leverage this year, and then what would be the drivers as you look at your 2024 model?\nSanjay Mehta: Okay, sure. Yeah, so obviously, it's another \u2013 it's an investment year and I think, in my prepared remarks, I noted that we're getting back to travel and trade shows, which is a key point. You know, you really, if you look at it in two portfolios, we've \u2013 for the year, we're going to have leverage in the test business where the growth in OpEx as a percentage will be lower, but the growth in the IA space [with the] OpEx growth is higher. And so, the leverage, you know, from a \u2013 like we're growing in the IA space, but we will see, we should see a degree of leverage in the short-term in the test business.  When you cascade that out to 2024, obviously with the revenues that we're predicting in IA, you know, I think Mark described it well, if we're growing at 50%, and have a forecast to continue to grow, we'll continue to drive the investment, but as the growth starts to go down, let's say below the Rule of 40 then we'll start to drop more to the bottom line. That's how we're thinking about it.\nVivek Arya: But when I look at that 2024 model, right there, you know, you're forecasting overall sales to grow at 6% CAGR, you know, from the 2020 level, so that is below the 16% CAGR you have been at, and you're saying operating margins are going to stay pretty much flattish versus, I'm just puzzled as to, you know, if you're saying sales are not really going to grow as much as they have grown in the last three, four years, and operating margins are not going to expand from here, is that model very conservative or what needs to be done to either grow faster or drive more operating leverage?\nSanjay Mehta: Yeah, I think that we\u2019ll, and that's why in my prepared remarks [I comment], we looked at the model, not just off of a point of 2020, but off of an average of 2019 and 2020, just given the significant balloon in 2020 tied to the mobility space, and then the contraction in IA. And when you look at it from an average of 2019 and 2020, we believe in that growth, overall growth of the 4% to 8%, and then we are during that period going to be growing out the investments in the IA portfolio.\nMark Jagiela: And I would just say, if you go back to what we said, if you look at that pie chart of the mix, when we get up to 2024, IA should be a bigger mix of our revenues and tests. So, test will continue to grow and will have a very high drop through, it'll be very efficient and if that's all you're looking at, yes, bottom line, profitability should increase, but on the IA side it's more likely that we'll be growing more rapidly, and we'll be pulling up gross margins for the enterprise with the IA business. But on the bottom line, you know, we're being a bit conservative on how much we plan to drop through there, because we want to keep investing for more and more growth. So, it kind of just depends on what's the investment profile in IA and we've modeled in, you know we're not going to optimize for profit in the mid-term there, we're optimizing for growth.\nVivek Arya: Understand. And Mark, just a follow up to that, you mentioned the prospects for some additional M&A, I presume it's in the IA side of the business, but I was hoping you would talk to that, do you \u2013 are you contemplating kind of smaller tuck-in, you know, technology type transactions? Are you thinking about something that could be bigger and could require the use of stock? Just how we should think about what the M&A pipeline is and how it could impact this baseline model that you have set for us? Thank you.\nMark Jagiela: Yeah. So, most of what we have in our pipeline is consistent with the kind of things we've been investing in and acquiring in the past five years to six years. Industrial automation, modestly sized investments, let's say relative to our market cap. However, we have expanded our aperture a bit to look in the test space, and areas that are correlated to test, which bring with it potentially some larger, M&A things. It's always governed by the same rich internal rate of return metrics that we always use on these things. So, whatever we do is going to be something that's more attractive to our investors than buying back our stock or, you know, that those kind of \u2013 our internal weighted cost of capital. So, that's about all I think I can say about that.\nVivek Arya: Alright. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks. I had a couple. So for OpEx this year, you're saying it's going to grow about 8% to 10%. So at the mid-point, you're going to grow OpEx about $76 million, I'm wondering, Sanjay, if you can tell us how much of that's going to come in IA? And I guess, you know, another way of asking that is, sort of what sort of op margin do you think you can do this year in IA? I mean, you're basically breakeven last year, can you get to high single digits this year? And is 10 to 15 still the long-term target for that business? I know that Mark\u2019s commenting that if growth slows, you can sort of crank back on OpEx and you can drop more, but just wondering if you can comment there? And then I have a follow up.\nSanjay Mehta: Sure, yeah, I think you hit it spot on. I think when you take out the travel and the trade shows, you know a majority of the spend will come in OpEx from \u2013 on a year-over-year basis. And from a profit perspective, you know, we're assuming growth, and we expect to improve, you know, back to our original growth plans, like if you think about 2020 as the anomaly and you look at the jump off point of 2019, we were about a 10%, you know, profit level with our growth. We should be in that similar level going forward in 2021.\nTimothy Arcuri: Okay, got it. So, you think you can get to 10% op margin this year?\nSanjay Mehta: Yeah, plus or minus, but yeah.\nTimothy Arcuri: Okay. Okay, great. And then I guess, a question for you, Mark. So when you were going to your top customer, you presented a couple scenarios. I know, it's very tough to predict, but the scenarios you presented didn't include that revenue from that customers down, you know, I get that the compute piece is going to be up, but they're also not going to shrink this year. And in the past, that's been sort of a harbinger of a potential decline in the number of testers they buy, unless they're willing to live with a much larger die size, which may or may not be the case. So, I'm just kind of wondering, you know, I'm not asking for any specifics on that customer, I'm just sort of wondering if you can look back in the past and draw on your past experience and say, well, yeah, in the past, when that happens, that is sort of a harbinger of, you know, the potential that it could be down because you didn't present that as a down or as a possible, you know, outcome this year. Thanks.\nMark Jagiela: Yeah, I think it's a possible outcome. But let me go back to what I was outlining in my remarks. When you look at the phone, there's various elements of the phone in terms of technology, apps processors, the modem, the cameras, the memory, those areas of the phone refresh and take leaps of complexity in different cadences. And in 2020, the apps processor and 5G, basically \u2013 the app processor had a big jump in complexity, and 5G proliferated throughout all the phones. So, as you look at 2021, the need for incremental 5G capacity, whereas in 2020, several, let's say 100 million units worth of phones needed 5G capacity. This year, it'll be less because the incremental unit growth there is one factor in incremental 5G capacity, plus complexity growth of the 5G modem itself. So, 5G is big in 2020, not as big in 2021. That leaves what's happening with the cameras, what's happening with power management, what's happening with the screen resolution, other things could be balloons that pull it back up, but I do think you do have that. 5G has happened for that one area of our mobility customer base.\nTimothy Arcuri: Yeah, agreed. Okay. Thank you.\nAndy Blanchard: And operator, we have time for just one more question please.\nOperator: Okay. The last question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.\nJohn Pitzer: Hey, Andy, thanks for sneaking me in and congratulations, guys. Mark, my first question is just on the whole China dynamic, you're clearly guiding if for them to be down this year. I'm kind of curious if there is a date on between U.S. China relations is that a zero sum game, an exercise in market shift or do you think it would be accretive? And I guess more importantly, we're now seeing the U.S. government kind of incentivize domestic production of Semi\u2019s. I'm just kind of curious as to whether or not you could benefit that from that either indirectly, as some of your customers build capacity domestically or directly as we think about your long term tax rate? And then I've got a quick follow up.\nMark Jagiela: Okay. So, you know, China, if for some reason, the restrictions on China ease and more indigenous Chinese makers start to grow again. I think it's neutral. You know, as business shifted out of China in 2020, it was pretty much neutral to us. There was \u2013 the customers that picked up the manufacturing of, let's say, applications, processors, or modems that would have been done by indigenous Chinese suppliers, or Teradyne customers and advanced test customers in a proportion that isn't that different than it was in China. So it ebbs and flows back and forth. I wouldn't say there's a big ramification. On the U.S. domestic supply question, you know, I think it's going to take a long time, and many, many years of a steadfast set of incentives from the government for that to mature to something significant to our business. You know, if we stick it that in the U.S. for seven, eight years, and really build up an infrastructure to manufacture semiconductors, domestically, I think it could have a bit of a positive impact. But I think it's small, I don't think because semiconductors might be manufactured in the U.S. All of a sudden, there's a propensity that they're going to buy more Teradyne equipment. It's at the margin, but nothing I would bake in as a trend line to count on.\nJohn Pitzer: That's helpful. Then just as my follow up going back to the 2024 model, your explanation is to kind of how you're getting to the op profit targets you're getting to, it makes a ton of sense. I'm just kind of curious, to the extent that the top line proves to be conservative, how should we think about incremental operating margins above, sort of the high-end of the target model or maybe another way of thinking about it as IA gets scale, you know, where do we think the longer-term op margin of the business can go?\nSanjay Mehta: Yeah, I think that if the test business, if what drives the incremental revenue of the test businesses come to fruition, I think you'll see, you know, higher drop through if \u2013 and again, just to repeat myself, if we're growing and we see continued growth, and we're going to continue to invest in IA that dropped through, maybe lower, but let's say it comes, let's say the revenues grow significantly over the first couple of years, and then at the end, they start to \u2013 the growth starts to tail down. You may see a little bit more leverage, but it's really, you know, we have to see how the market unfolds in IA, but you know, over the short-term, we are planning a significant investment.\nJohn Pitzer: Helpful guys. Thank you.\nAndy Blanchard : Alright folks, that wraps us up for today. Look forward to talking to you in the days ahead and those that are still in the queue, I'll get back to you straight away. Thanks so much.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark Jagiela",
            "content": "Good morning and thanks for joining us. In our call today, I'll summarize our Q4 and 2020 full-year highlights and provide some initial comments on our outlook for 2021. Sanjay will then provide the financial details, Q1 outlook, and review our updated earnings model and capital allocation plans. Fourth quarter capped off an amazing year for Teradyne with sales up 16% from the fourth quarter of 2019, and non-GAAP earnings per share up 25%. That brought our full-year sales to just over 3.1 billion, up 36% and non-GAAP EPS to $4.62, up 62% versus 2019. These annual results, driven by strength in all of our test businesses, more than made up for a soft industrial automation market that was impacted by COVID. For the full-year, our SemiTest business was especially strong driven by investments in smartphone related test capacity, our expansion into the compute sector of SOC with our new UltraFLEXplus product, and the ramp of our Magnum EPIC product for DRAM test. In smartphones, global unit shipments contracted in 2020, but the growth in chipset complexity continued driving tester demand higher. Each subsystem on the phone, cellular power management, conductivity, display, cameras, and application processing has its own cycle. And in 2020 both the processor and the cellular areas took big steps up in complexity. We use transistor count as a proxy for complexity and the leading phone applications processors now exceed 10 billion transistors, growing double-digits each generation. In 2020, we also saw the beginning of meaningful 5G silicon content, which necessitated a build-out of new tester capacity. Together these lifted the mobility test market in 2020, roughly $200 million to about 1.7 billion. This continuous refresh of smartphone silicon should be a tailwind for the semiconductor test business for the foreseeable future. In 2020, we also ramped our UltraFLEXplus product in the compute portion of the SOC market.  Recall, this has historically been a $500 million to $600 million market, where we've had relatively low share. With the emergence of more players and applications in the processor market, including hyper scalars and AI, we expect this sector to outgrow the general market. The plus, brings a powerful value proposition in managing the unique complexity, power dynamics, yield learning, and time to market requirements of this segment. For 2020, we estimate the SOC market was in the range of $3.4 billion to $3.5 billion, up from about $3.3 billion in 2019. We estimate our SOC test market share moved up 15 points to about 54%. However, our internal view of share smooths out year-on-year swings due to the unique timing of investment cycles of both our and our competitors' customers. By that measure, we estimate our normalized 2020 SOC share at about 50%. Another notable growth segment of our SemiTest business in 2020 was memory. In this call, a year ago, we noted a significant design win for Magnum EPIC product and LPDDR5 portion of the DRAM market. This new entry into DRAM test ramped through the year and combined with healthy growth in our [traditional band business], drove a 41% increase in memory sales from 2019. We estimate the market was about $900 million in 2020, up from $600 million in 2019, and our normalized 2020 memory share at about 42%. Beyond SemiTest, our System Test Group also had a great year delivering 43% growth, with the storage test business more than doubling from 2019. This is the second consecutive year of hyper growth and storage test driven by steady test intensity growth of terabyte HDD drives and similar growth in the system level test of complex semiconductor devices. In our wireless test business at light point sales grew by 10% from 2019 with solid demand from both our conductivity and cellular end markets. WiFi 6, ultra-wideband test, and increased investments in 5G related handset tests all contributed. The performance of our test businesses more than offset the weaker results in our industrial automation business, which contracted 6% for the year. The global slowdown in manufacturing activity led to a 12% decline in sales at our Universal Robots unit. MiR on the other hand grew 1% as makers of ultraviolet disinfecting products recognize the value of an easier to deploy fully autonomous mobile robot. On a pro forma basis, auto guide also grew for the year. While the environment in IAA was weaker than expected, the business troughed in the second quarter of 2020 and has improved dramatically in the second half, including record sales at UR in the fourth quarter. Collectively, the businesses returned to year-over-year growth in Q4 with UR growing 6% year-over-year and 41% sequential growth. With tests showing continued strength and industrial automation returning to growth we are set up for another exciting year in 2021. Specifically, we are expecting a strong start to the year across all our businesses with Q1 showing greater than 6% growth at the midpoint, compared to Q1 of 2020. As you know, full-year visibility is always a challenge as evidenced by our missing the strength of the test market and the decline of the IAA market and our forecast just one-year ago. That said, let me describe how we see things today. And of course we'll keep you updated in future calls. I will preface my remarks with a note that the well publicized surge in the forecasted semiconductor CapEx in 2021 is a very bullish sign. However, the impact on test is likely to be felt in 2020 and beyond as fab capacity built this year will drive additional testers in future years aligned to fab commissioning and ramping volumes and yields. In SOC test, the dynamics that made 2020 such a strong year continue into 2021. In addition, we have strengthening demand in the long dormant automotive test market with orders for our Eagle test product lines surging. Smartphone shipments are expected to grow in 2021 after contracting about 10% in 2020 and 5G content should increase. On the other hand, the SOC test market in China will likely be down in 2021 due to the expanded and full-year effects of trade restrictions that were widened in 2020. Also, as always, tester demand from our largest customer will remain opaque until sometime in Q2. Additionally, the global economic impact of COVID and its impact on electronics demand after a surge in 2020, it's hard to forecast with the arguments for both positive and negative effects. Taking all of that into account, we have a bit wider range in our SOC market size estimate for 2021 at 3.3 billion to 3.8 billion, up slightly from 2020 at the midpoint. In memory tests, the transition to LPDDR-5 and DDR5 should gain momentum in 2021 and beyond. After growing about 50% in 2020, we view the memory market to be in the $800 billion to $1 billion range in 2021, about even with 2020 at the midpoint. In storage tests, the underlying demand drivers of increased density and HDD, and increased complexity and semi devices driving system level tests remain in place. However, visibility is limited and annual shipments can be very lumpy. After more than tripling over the last three years, we expect 2021 sales to be in a band of plus or minus 20% from the 2020 level. For the rest of our test businesses, we expect growth in the 5% to 10% range in 2021. In Industrial Automation, 2021 is starting off on a strong footing. Barring any additional COVID-related manufacturing sector shutdowns, we expect to deliver the highest ever first quarter sales in each of our automation businesses and we are well-positioned to grow in excess of 30% for the year. 2020s results reflect well on Teradyne's strategy, execution, and efficiency. Our test businesses show the successful results of R&D bets made in years past and enable us to increase those bets for the future. Our Industrial Automation investments continue undeterred by short-term impacts of COVID, and we are well-positioned to capitalize on a world emerging to invest even more in automation to improve resilience and productivity. Equally significant, 2020 showed the resilience of Teradyne employees, our global suppliers, and our operating model. In the face of unimaginable challenges across communities worldwide, the team dealt with health, safety, and operation obstacles daily, met R&D milestones, executed steep new product ramps, and delivered record shipments of SOC, memory, and storage text products to meet our customer's needs. We get all this while exercising the cost and schedule discipline expected to Teradyne. This is truly extraordinary, and I'm very grateful to be part of such a powerful team. As we move into 2021, the outlook appears bright across all our markets. As Sanjay will detail, we are returning to our share repurchase program and have an active M&A pipeline. As 2020 taught us, no matter what comes our way in the short-term, I am confident our global team and market strategy will deliver exciting long-term returns for our customers, investors, and employees. Sanjay will now take you through the financial and modeling details. Sanjay? Yeah. So, good question. Certainly auto is going to be up sequentially in 2020. We've talked about that market being at a normalized, let's say maybe more of a peak run rate in the $400 million to $500 million range, it's been sort of 200 million last year. So, this year that should be up at least 150 million, maybe 200 million. It's really right now a bit of a rush for capacity. And we don't know exactly when the demand profile of orders are going to taper off here. So, it could go higher if this persists. So that's the color on auto. In mobility, I think it's harder for us to see that at the moment because of the significant impact of our largest customer on both us in the market, which doesn't really become solidified until April-ish of the year. So, we're looking at it, sort of, flat plus or minus $100 million in mobility. Yeah, I think \u2013 that's a good question. I think all other groups are going to be better than 30. And some of them like AutoGuide are small, so I think they'll pull up the average, be ahead of UR and MiR UR should be about the same for the year. Okay. Yeah, I think that's certainly a balloon for the year Mehdi. You know, maybe we're going to double the number of millimeter wave enabled phones in 2021, but yes, last year, if you recall, there was also a significant step up in the hundreds of millions of units of millimeter wave enabled phones were brought to market last year. So, if you add another 200 million to 300 million additional millimeter wave enabled units this year, and let's say that brings the global total to 600 million units out of 1.4 billion, you're essentially adding about as much capacity maybe a little bit more, because there'll be more than let's say last year, added 250, this year might add 350 million units. So yes, there will be a little bit of growth in additional millimeter wave test capacity. But last year was a pretty big year too. Okay, you know, I always am a bit reluctant to be too specific on any one customer. So, I'm going to speak more to the segment, a bit, which I'll bundle compute and mobility together here. So, last year was incredibly strong in both our traditional mobility market because of the complexity growth of phones, which we alluded to, and the fact that we did enter compute as a new segment. So, we ended up with additional revenues in compute last year that, you know, north of $50 million for the first year in that market. So, as we think about this year, the issue of smartphone unit growth and complexity growth of the apps processor, the camera systems and such in the phones is part of the equation, and we have a reasonably good read on that. On the compute side, there's a lot of moving parts there. And there's a lot \u2013 since it's a new market for us and a new market for some of our customers that has the bigger range of potential outcomes for the year. You know, so that's the one we're triangulating on. That could be up significantly over last year. It could be up modestly over last year, but at this point, we really can't be too specific. Just one thing, I'm going to add on to that commentary around the industrial automation business to remind people that what we focus on right now during the high growth phase of that business is sales growth and gross margin. And the bottom line, as Sanjay mentioned, if we're at breakeven, we're happy as long as we can sort of adhere to or exceed the Rule of 40. And through the mid-term, we think we expect to be close to that kind of up top line growth rates. And what we bring down to the bottom line will, kind of depend on the size of the growth, what we see ahead of us. And if we're growing at 50% and breakeven, we're happy as [indiscernible] and if the growth rates come down below 20%, we'll start dropping more and more down to the bottom line. And I'd just add to that, that certainly automotive was one of the most hard hit aspects of URs business. You know, automotive has been running in the high 30s, 40% of the business coming into 2020 that contracted dramatically because of COVID, down, you know, to the point that it was in the low-20s. And I would say it's certainly at this point, although back and growing it hasn't come back yet to where it should be in our portfolio.  As issues around the semiconductor supply chain and other things have sort of crimped some of the ambitions of car companies to ramp volumes here, there's a little bit to go still. But our footprint over time since we acquired UR has been reducing in the automotive segment, not so much because automotive is not growing, of course, but it's just that our expansion into the other areas that Sanjay mentioned has been and we expect over time, that automotive component will continue to decline as a percentage of our sales. Yes. Good question. So, to be frank with you, we had a good year. We grew, you know, 50-ish percent in the year, but we didn't hit our target. And part of this is extended evaluations that the larger accounts that you're referencing, and it's been very difficult in a small business like AutoGuide's case in a COVID area to acquire new customers and get the pilot production validation work done in the same timeframe that we could have gotten it done in a non-COVID world. So, we've seen some extension of those [eval], but we're in the some of the boutique name brands for [evals] that you would hope we are in both the industrial manufacturing side, as well as the e-commerce side and logistics side of life. So, we're hoping that this year is going to be the big breakout year. It's the kind of business that should at least be doubling, if not more, once these big accounts latch, but we did \u2013 if any place sort of had a big impact from COVID last year, it was AutoGuide because of the whole, you know, new customer acquisition is the whole game there at this point. Yeah. So, if you look at China, I think you need to separate memory and SOC, because it's quite different. On the memory side, there will be growth in China this year in test as well. And we \u2013 or we expect that at least. And so that's a healthy growing mid-term profile, I'd say for China. On SOC, it's really a little bit more difficult to see growth occurring this year. Because the impact of the trade restrictions on Huawei and HiSilicon are tremendous in terms of their buying power in the market historically. What they buy in both silicon and then test capacity for that silicon has been severely hampered. And then further restrictions on other companies like SMIC and such are much smaller factors, but are headwinds against growth. So, I think SOC is likely to contract, memory is going to grow, but net-net, you know, it's not going to be hugely down, but it'll probably be done a little bit on the test side of life. And I would just say, if you go back to what we said, if you look at that pie chart of the mix, when we get up to 2024, IA should be a bigger mix of our revenues and tests. So, test will continue to grow and will have a very high drop through, it'll be very efficient and if that's all you're looking at, yes, bottom line, profitability should increase, but on the IA side it's more likely that we'll be growing more rapidly, and we'll be pulling up gross margins for the enterprise with the IA business. But on the bottom line, you know, we're being a bit conservative on how much we plan to drop through there, because we want to keep investing for more and more growth. So, it kind of just depends on what's the investment profile in IA and we've modeled in, you know we're not going to optimize for profit in the mid-term there, we're optimizing for growth. Yeah. So, most of what we have in our pipeline is consistent with the kind of things we've been investing in and acquiring in the past five years to six years. Industrial automation, modestly sized investments, let's say relative to our market cap. However, we have expanded our aperture a bit to look in the test space, and areas that are correlated to test, which bring with it potentially some larger, M&A things. It's always governed by the same rich internal rate of return metrics that we always use on these things. So, whatever we do is going to be something that's more attractive to our investors than buying back our stock or, you know, that those kind of \u2013 our internal weighted cost of capital. So, that's about all I think I can say about that. Yeah, I think it's a possible outcome. But let me go back to what I was outlining in my remarks. When you look at the phone, there's various elements of the phone in terms of technology, apps processors, the modem, the cameras, the memory, those areas of the phone refresh and take leaps of complexity in different cadences. And in 2020, the apps processor and 5G, basically \u2013 the app processor had a big jump in complexity, and 5G proliferated throughout all the phones. So, as you look at 2021, the need for incremental 5G capacity, whereas in 2020, several, let's say 100 million units worth of phones needed 5G capacity. This year, it'll be less because the incremental unit growth there is one factor in incremental 5G capacity, plus complexity growth of the 5G modem itself. So, 5G is big in 2020, not as big in 2021. That leaves what's happening with the cameras, what's happening with power management, what's happening with the screen resolution, other things could be balloons that pull it back up, but I do think you do have that. 5G has happened for that one area of our mobility customer base. Okay. So, you know, China, if for some reason, the restrictions on China ease and more indigenous Chinese makers start to grow again. I think it's neutral. You know, as business shifted out of China in 2020, it was pretty much neutral to us. There was \u2013 the customers that picked up the manufacturing of, let's say, applications, processors, or modems that would have been done by indigenous Chinese suppliers, or Teradyne customers and advanced test customers in a proportion that isn't that different than it was in China. So it ebbs and flows back and forth. I wouldn't say there's a big ramification. On the U.S. domestic supply question, you know, I think it's going to take a long time, and many, many years of a steadfast set of incentives from the government for that to mature to something significant to our business. You know, if we stick it that in the U.S. for seven, eight years, and really build up an infrastructure to manufacture semiconductors, domestically, I think it could have a bit of a positive impact. But I think it's small, I don't think because semiconductors might be manufactured in the U.S. All of a sudden, there's a propensity that they're going to buy more Teradyne equipment. It's at the margin, but nothing I would bake in as a trend line to count on."

            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Today I'll cover the financial highlights of Q4 and review the financial details of 2020. Looking forward, I'll provide our Q1 outlook. An update to our mid-term earnings model and our capital allocation plans. Now to Q4, revenues were $759 million, which were $19 million above the high-end of the guidance range. We delivered a non-GAAP operating profit of 30% and EPS of $1.10. SemiTest revenue of $524 million was driven by SOC and memory test demand enabling 5G handsets and higher speed flash and DRAM devices. System Test Group had revenue of $104 million down quarter-over-quarter driven by lower storage test shipments. Industrial Automation or IA, revenue of $92 million had a seasonal increase over Q3 and delivered year-over-year growth for the first time in 2020. LitePoint revenue of $40 million was approximately flat with Q3, and down year-over-year with a decline in trailing edge conductivity products, partially offset by new sales of new conductivity technology like WiFi 6 and emerging UWB technology. Non-GAAP gross margins were 59% on plan and quarter-over-quarter due to product mix. You'll see our non-GAAP operating expenses were up 14 million to $224 million from the third quarter, due to increased test spending to support design wins, higher payroll, due to four extra days in the quarter, and ongoing IA investments. We generated $222 million in free cash in the fourth quarter. The tax rate, excluding discrete items for the quarter was 13% on a GAAP basis and 14.5% on a non-GAAP basis. For the full-year it is 14.75% on a GAAP basis, and 15.25% on a non-GAAP basis. We ended the year with cash and marketable securities of $1.55 billion. Turning to the full-year results of 2020, Teradyne revenues of $3.12 billion grew $826 million, or 36% year-over-year. $845 million of the growth was from our test portfolio, while IA contracted $18 million, due to the pandemic related slowdown. We had one customer that accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in 2020, which we'll disclose in our 10-K filing. Gross margins for the year were 57%, and operating profit was 30%, which is up from 25% in 2019. Non-GAAP EPS was $4.62, an increase of 62% over 2019. We generated $684 million in free cash in 2020. Breaking down the components of 2020 revenues, as outlined by Mark, SOC test revenues grew $595 million or 46% on strength and mobility, market driven by increase by device complexity and new standards like 5G along with growth in computing. In memory, revenues were $383 million, up 41%. While LPDDR related DRAM revenues were a significant contributor to our results, we also continue to see strong NAND test demand through the year. In system test, sales grew for the fourth year running. Revenue of $410 million grew $122 million or 43% year-over-year, primarily on growth and storage test for both hard disk drive and system level test. Storage test sales were $242 million, up from $115 million in 2019. We also saw annual growth in our defense and aerospace components of STG. At LitePoint sales grew for the fourth consecutive year to $173 million, 10% above 2019. In 2020, IA revenue was $280 million, a decline of 6% from 2019 on an as reported basis, or 9% on a pro forma basis.  As Mark noted, the COVID related driven slowdown in manufacturing impacted Universal Robots, reducing revenue to $219 million, down 12% year-over-year. After troughing in Q2, UR grew in the second half 2020 versus the first half of the year. In Q4, revenue grew 6% year-over-year, giving confidence heading into 2021. MiR grew slightly year-over-year, with annual sales of $45 million and AutoGuide full-year sales grew on a pro forma basis.  Now to our outlook for Q1. Sales are expected to be between $720 million and $780 million. Non-GAAP EPS range of $0.95 to $1.11 on 179 million diluted shares. The first quarter guidance excludes amortization of acquired intangibles, and the non-cash imputed interest on convertible debt. First quarter gross margins are estimated at 58% to 59%. First quarter OpEx running at 29% to 31% of first quarter sales is about flat with Q4 at the midpoint of guidance.  The non-GAAP operating profit rate at the midpoint of our first quarter guidance is 29%. Regarding our OpEx plans for 2021, we expect our OpEx to grow 8% to 10% from 2020's $840 million. Approximately two points of the spend will be in the back half of the year related to travel, which we expect to resume to pre-COVID levels along with trade shows. In our test portfolio, we plan to increase our spending in engineering, sales and marketing, primarily in SemiTests. In IA, we'll continue to invest to reinforce our competitive product and ecosystem position across the sector. Also in IA, go-to-market investments will be made to support expected revenue growth. Turning to capital expenditures. In 2020, our CapEx was $185 million. This was used primarily for customer demonstration equipment, operations, engineering, and initial spending on new facilities to replace leased ones in locations where we plan to grow over the next several years. We'll continue to invest in these new facilities in 2021. So, CapEx is expected to be similar to 2020. Recall, we're buying land and developing it to eliminate lease costs and enable a more efficient spend profile over the mid-to-long term. 2021 GAAP tax rate is estimated at 15.5%, and our non-GAAP tax rate is estimated at 16% based on current tax laws. Moving to our mid-term earnings model. As you've seen with 2020, our non-GAAP of $4.62, we've exceeded our 2022 earnings model two years early on the strength of our test businesses. We continue to have confidence in the long-term growth outlook for test and we expect IA to return to high growth as the global industrial economy improves. When building our midterm model, given our year-on-year demand swings, we've seen both in [test and IA], we use the average of 2019 and 2020 revenues as the baseline for our growth projections. From that baseline, we expect test revenue to grow 4% to 8% compounded and IA revenues to grow 20% to 35% through 2024. In test, we expect that growth will be driven by steady increase in device complexity across our businesses, along with the high-single-digit semiconductor unit growth trend line, In IA, market penetration of cobots and autonomous mobile robots and forklifts remains low, while the range of applications they economically serve continues to expand, resulting in an attractive long-term growth opportunity for Teradyne. We expect this will drive 2024 company revenue to $3.9 billion and non-GAAP EPS to $6 at the mid-point of our estimates. Gross margin is modeled at 58% to 59%, OpEx as a percentage of sales will decline to 28% to 29%, and non-GAAP operating margin will improve to 30% to 31%. The model assumes the current tax laws are in place.  Shifting to capital allocation. We'll continue to balance a strong cash position to support our operating investments and potential M&A with direct shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases. We are raising our minimum cash levels from 1 billion to 1.25 billion, with the $250 million increase tied to the increased valuations of potential acquisitions.  Recall, we held $500 million for M&A and $500 million for severe economic downturn. We will also be increasing our cash balance in 2021 through 2023 to service our convertible bond, which comes due in December 2023. To date, $51 million of that bond has been redeemed early, with payment planned in Q1, with the remaining face value of $409 million. Regarding share repurchases, in 2020, we bought back 1.5 million shares for $88 million at an average price of $58.32. Recall, we suspended our share repurchase program in April due to COVID-related uncertainty. We are replacing our prior approved program with a new share repurchase authorization of $2 billion with no fixed end date. We plan a minimum of $600 million of repurchases in 2021. As in the past, the plan has both programmatic and opportunistic components. In summary, 2020 inflicted incredible human and economic hardship on the society across [the globe] and we're respectful of the widespread pain and loss. When the pandemic hit, I noted our priorities were the safety of our employees, supporting our customers, continued execution, and achieving our financial objectives. The Teradyne community responded with a collaborative and supportive spirit, incredible energy, ingenuity, and purpose, which delivered on all three of these priorities. I'm incredibly proud and thankful to be part of this team. We enter 2021 in the strongest position in our history. The work in 2020 has made us more resilient and prepared us for the strong market demand that we currently see in both test and IA. While our visibility for the full-year is limited. We're confident in the underlying market fundamentals, our competitive diversified portfolio, and our team which will enable long-term growth prospects for the markets we serve. Collectively, we're excited to turn our new financial model into reality.  With that, I'll turn things back to Andy. Yeah, hi, Mehdi, it's Sanjay. Yeah, so in the earnings model, we see obviously growth in the market. As Mark alluded to, you know, more players are coming into the compute space that we can address. And with that, we feel that with the UltraFLEXplus solution we're very well-positioned, and we are projecting share growth. When we think about from a memory perspective, you know if you go back, let's say 10 years, you know, we've been on this steady increase of memory share growth, where as we continue to execute, we see continued share growth on that perspective as well. So, really growth in market size, as well as continued share growth are our drivers. You want to expand on that question? Yeah. Okay. Thanks for the clarification. Yes, it is. You know, with device complexity we're going 5 nanometer and then to 3 nanometer. I think both system level test, as well as ATE test take that into account. Yeah, hi it's Sanjay. So, IA as a whole this year was roughly just a bit better than breakeven. Obviously, with the COVID impact on multiple businesses, and the contraction in UR, you know, we're just above breakeven, but you know, fundamentally, we continue to invest in the portfolio, the ecosystem, the go to market for product and differentiation, ease of implementation. And so you should expect that to continue over the mid-term and, you know we're focused on driving the revenue growth and the investments. And so, with that we expect the margin profile to be roughly consistent with the current profile, as we \u2013 as AutoGuide is relatively new to the organization, just over a year. We expect that to, you know improve with our, you know our Teradyne supply chain, as well as other quality processes we step in. Yeah, sure. It's Sanjay here. So, you know, in the short run we actually saw a contraction as evidenced by, you know, how our revenues were. However, I think your comments hit home with regards to plant and warehouse decision makers seeking to build resilience into their supply chains. And we view that over the mid-term as a tailwind. We are seeing, we are seeing the market obviously come back with Universal Robots. We've talked in our prepared remarks about the automotive and electronics industry, and then we're also seeing strength in a couple of other verticals. Yeah, I think that, you know, as I articulated from \u2013 I'll touch on memory first, you know, our share right now, [is in the] low 40s, you know, we see that \u2013 we could see that growing to the mid-40s in the plan, and then from an SOC perspective, Mark talked about our normalized share level of about 50%. And we see that increasing over the mid-term. So, yeah, I think what we've been saying C.J. is that we can get about a point to a point and a half a share growth a year. So, by 2024, as I mentioned, I think our normalized share is somewhere around 50, we should be up around 55, 56 by then in SOC. And in memory, share moves a little chunkier, because there's only a few players there. So, on the memory side, you know we could be in the mid-to-upper mid-40s by then, I would say, is one way to think about it. But the other piece of color in terms of aggressive versus conservative that I'd add here is, the recent investment profile of the front-end with CapEx moving up into the $70 billion range is something we haven't modeled into our mid-term plan. We've assumed that incremental fab capacity across the mid-term would be sort of consistent with the rate that it's been added for the prior four years. So, if $70 billion plus of investment in [WFE] is the new normal for the next four years, that's certainly going to drive more tests than we model. I mean, gross margins, we \u2013 you should expect are relatively consistent with how we've guided Q1 in our long-term model. Yeah, I think that, you know with an emerging market, there's still a lot of footprint to cover. So, we expect that to continue in the automotive vertical, as well as electronics and industrials, as well as other verticals. Yeah, we're seeing also \u2013 we're seeing market drivers and verticals, adoption, and education, R&D, pharma, as well as Life Sciences, but from a starting point, obviously, we have a very strong incumbent installed base over the years that we've built in the auto vertical. Yeah, I think that obviously, UR we've had for a little bit longer. And it is a larger percentage, but I think you're spot on that the AMR portion will grow with AutoGuide and MiR as a percentage of revenue. Okay, sure. Yeah, so obviously, it's another \u2013 it's an investment year and I think, in my prepared remarks, I noted that we're getting back to travel and trade shows, which is a key point. You know, you really, if you look at it in two portfolios, we've \u2013 for the year, we're going to have leverage in the test business where the growth in OpEx as a percentage will be lower, but the growth in the IA space [with the] OpEx growth is higher. And so, the leverage, you know, from a \u2013 like we're growing in the IA space, but we will see, we should see a degree of leverage in the short-term in the test business.  When you cascade that out to 2024, obviously with the revenues that we're predicting in IA, you know, I think Mark described it well, if we're growing at 50%, and have a forecast to continue to grow, we'll continue to drive the investment, but as the growth starts to go down, let's say below the Rule of 40 then we'll start to drop more to the bottom line. That's how we're thinking about it. Yeah, I think that we'll, and that's why in my prepared remarks [I comment], we looked at the model, not just off of a point of 2020, but off of an average of 2019 and 2020, just given the significant balloon in 2020 tied to the mobility space, and then the contraction in IA. And when you look at it from an average of 2019 and 2020, we believe in that growth, overall growth of the 4% to 8%, and then we are during that period going to be growing out the investments in the IA portfolio. Sure, yeah, I think you hit it spot on. I think when you take out the travel and the trade shows, you know a majority of the spend will come in OpEx from \u2013 on a year-over-year basis. And from a profit perspective, you know, we're assuming growth, and we expect to improve, you know, back to our original growth plans, like if you think about 2020 as the anomaly and you look at the jump off point of 2019, we were about a 10%, you know, profit level with our growth. We should be in that similar level going forward in 2021. Yeah, plus or minus, but yeah. Yeah, I think that if the test business, if what drives the incremental revenue of the test businesses come to fruition, I think you'll see, you know, higher drop through if \u2013 and again, just to repeat myself, if we're growing and we see continued growth, and we're going to continue to invest in IA that dropped through, maybe lower, but let's say it comes, let's say the revenues grow significantly over the first couple of years, and then at the end, they start to \u2013 the growth starts to tail down. You may see a little bit more leverage, but it's really, you know, we have to see how the market unfolds in IA, but you know, over the short-term, we are planning a significant investment."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Andy Blanchard, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nAndy Blanchard: Thank you, Josh. Good morning everyone, and welcome to our discussion of Teradyne's most recent financial results. I'm joined this morning by our CEO, Mark Jagiela; and our CFO, Sanjay Mehta. Following our opening remarks, we'll provide details of our performance for 2020's third quarter, along with our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2020. The press release containing our third quarter results was issued last evening. We're providing slides on the Investor page of the website that may be helpful to you in following the discussion. Replay of this call will be available via the same page after the call ends. The matters that we discuss today will include forward-looking statements. They involve Risk Factors that could cause Teradyne's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statements contained in the earnings release as well as our most recent SEC filings. Additionally, those forward-looking statements are made as of today and we take no obligation to update them as a result of developments occurring after this call. During today's call, we'll make reference to non-GAAP financial measures. We have posted additional information concerning these non-GAAP financial measures including the reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, where available on the Investor page of our website. Also, please take special note of the Safe Harbor Statement in the press release and slide deck for risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic and changes to U.S. export regulations. Looking ahead between now and our next earnings call, Teradyne expects to participate in technology or industrial focused Investor Conferences hosted by Baird, Wolfe Research, Credit Suisse, and UBS. Now, let's get on with the rest of the agenda. First, Mark, will comment on our recent results, current market conditions, trade regulations, and our future outlook. Sanjay will then offer more details on our quarterly results, along with our guidance for the fourth quarter. We will then answer your questions. And this call is scheduled for one hour. Mark?\nMark Jagiela: Thanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. My prepared remarks today will cover three topics. First, the highlights of our third quarter and first nine months of the year; second, the impacts of the latest trade regulations on Teradyne; and third, I'll share with you how we're thinking about the test and automation markets as we closeout 2020 and look into the next year and beyond. Our third quarter results were above guidance and reflect the continued strength of our test businesses. Additionally, our industrial automation businesses grew 17% from the Q2 trough and we are now operating at 2019 quarterly levels as manufacturing activities in Europe and North America improve. At the company level sales in Q3 were 41% above Q3 2019 and non-GAAP EPS grew 53% from the year ago level. Throughout 2020, we have seen increased short-term upside demand across our Semi Test end markets. The impact of this is clear in both our above guidance results in Q3, and in our Q4 guidance, which at the mid-point is substantially higher than we forecast in July. Throughout 2020, the semiconductor ecosystem has seen somewhat cautious initial forecasts, which were replaced with better than expected actual demand, and tests has been no exception. We continue to run a manufacturing pipeline that allows us to respond to this upside. Stepping back and looking at our performance to the first nine months of the year, the results show the success of our new products and related designing efforts and the resilience of our employees, supply line partners, and operating model. Teradyne sales through nine months are up 44% and our non-GAAP earnings per share are up 79%. Our test businesses collectively grew 52% year-to-date, while industrial automation revenue on a as reported basis contracted 10% reflecting the pandemic impact. In Semi Test, we estimate the SOC market will be about $3.3 billion, roughly flat with 2019's level as automotive, industrial, and linear markets remain depressed. However, our SOC test business is up 53% year-to-date due to strong investments in mobility test, and the shipment of our new UltraFLEXplus platform which is ramping significant design wins. The principal driver of mobility test demand continues to be increases in complexity of cell phone silicon. This is especially notable in 2020, when smartphone unit shipments are expected to decline about 10% to 1.2 billion. Yet the collective test intensity of each unit continues to grow at a rate in excess of this unit decline. Within smartphones, the mid to high tier is the place to be in test and that's where Teradyne is solidly positioned. These phones are seeing disproportionate growth and complexity related to multiple high density camera arrays and the associated processing power and storage to manage this data. Another complexity driver is 5G. And these high tier phones are early adopters of the extra silicon needed to enable these features. Less than 250 million phones are expected to be 5G-enabled in 2020 and only a fraction of those will support millimeter wave communication. So despite the bump in 2020, we are still in the very early stages of 5G adoption. Memory test is another bright spot. The market is likely to be up about 50% from 600 million in 2019 to about 900 million in 2020. The shipment ramp of our Magnum EPIC product LPDDR5 win last year, combined with continued strength in flash demand has driven our year-to-date memory revenues up 70% from 2019. In System Test, revenues are up nearly 50% through nine months on growth in storage test and defense-related investments. Recall storage tests served HDD and System Level Test markets and we expect sales to more than double in 2020 to over $200 million. And at LitePoint, sales are up 18% year-to-date due to increasing adoption of advanced connectivity standards like WiFi, 6E, and our growing share in 5G production test. As noted earlier in industrial automation we saw a significant uptick in demand in Q3 with growth of 17% off the second quarter trough. UR grew 23% as demand in Europe, North America and China showed steady gains. AutoGuide continues to win new accounts and we expect over 50% growth in 2020 on a pro forma basis. Regarding trade, as we noted last quarter, the China military end user restrictions require increased compliance work and costs. But we do not expect any material impact on our sales into China. In the case of Huawei restrictions, the fleet of testers previously installed at OSAT to support their device tests are already being reabsorbed into the market to test the alternative sources of silicon supply that's growing to fill in the gap created by these regulations at Huawei. For example, in the third quarter, we have seen an increase in upgrade orders at these OSAT customers to reconfigure installed testers to meet the unique needs of new customers. This upgrading and repurposing continues into fourth quarter. Shifting to the future, it's difficult to make the call on how 2021 will shape up as it's been difficult to predict 2020 even on a quarterly basis. Customers will likely continue to forecast conservatively and respond close in to demand. However, semiconductor complexity growth has proven itself resilient to COVID and is the fundamental driver of our test business. With that in mind, I'll comment on a few of the key indicators that we will be watching. In SOC test, we will be watching the smartphone market for complexity increases to support higher performance video and still photography, the adoption rate of 5G and Millimeter Wave, AI integration, enhance that unit growth. We'll also be watching the automotive and analog markets for signs of a sustainable recovery in test demand. Longer-term the increase in edge AI devices should drive billions of additional complex chip units into the market by 2025, so early design wins in that area are key. In memory, the transition to higher performance DDR5 standards is just underway and should accelerate in 2021, along with newer high speed UFS and NVMe flash interface. The roadmaps for both flash and DRAM show continued growth in interface speeds, which is another driver of test intensity beyond the traditional bid growth and should drive healthy memory test demand over the mid-term. At LitePoint, the continued growth of WiFi 6, 6E, and ultra-wideband connectivity standards, along with 5G will be drivers for continued growth. A bit further out we expect the next-generation WiFi 7 standard will require another refresh of the entire existing connectivity install base of testers. Consistent test, storage test is the interesting wildcard. After a torrid growth in 2020, the underlying demand drivers remain in place. In HDD both increasing complexity and 30% plus annual exabyte growth. And in system level tests increasing device complexity and higher quality requirements are driving the additional test intensity. However, both are narrow markets and prone to swings in investment levels at individual customers. Our industrial automation businesses are well-aligned to long-term economic and technical trends in manufacturing and material handling so we are confident in their ability to return to high growth. The only question is how quick do the manufacturing economy returns to help. We continue to scale our distribution capability and invest in R&D to widen our leading position. Among other things, AutoGuide adoption by key logistics, e-commerce, retail, and automotive customers in 2021 will set the stage for multiple years of double-digit growth. Despite these comments, as I've noted in the past, we do not spend too much time trying to predict the various short-term demand drivers as they generally don't affect our investment plans. We do spend a lot of time trying to predict the underlying long-term growth drivers. We want to be positioned with the right products at the right customers at the right time. We believe the use of semiconductors across the global economy will continue to expand and chip complexity will grow along with that expansion. Similarly, in industrial automation, the cost performance of the sensor software and mechanical building blocks of advanced automation continues to improve making our products economically attractive to an expanding universe of customers. We have built our strategy on these fundamental beliefs and built our operating model with the flexibility to deal efficiently with the inevitable ups and downs of economic cycles. So while we can't predict what lies ahead in 2021, we finished 2020 on an optimistic note, the company -- across the company, our employees delivered remarkable results under very difficult circumstances. Our new test and AI products are seen strong market acceptance, and our R&D pipelines are well-stocked with future products to drive future growth. With that, I'll turn things over to Sanjay for the financial details.\nSanjay Mehta: Thank you, Mark, and hello everyone. In my remarks I'll review our Q3 financial results, comments on how COVID is impacting our business, provide Q4 guidance, and comment on our full-year financial outlook at the mid-point of our Q4 guidance. Our third quarter sales of $819 million were just above the high-end of the guidance range, which enabled a 30% non-GAAP operating margin and a $1.18 non-GAAP EPS, which is also above the high-end of our range. Strengthen in Semi Test and storage test were the revenue highlight. Improved profit was a result of higher sales, partially offset by a higher than forecasted tax rate. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $211 million and our non-GAAP diluted share count in the quarter was $175 million. In Q3, our non-GAAP tax rate was 17.4%, which included a year-to-date catch-up as our estimated 2020 annual non-GAAP tax rate increase to 15.5% from our prior forecast of 14.5%. The increased tax rate is driven by higher foreign earnings, which resulted in an increase in the U.S. minimum tax on foreign earnings. We generated $280 million in free cash flow in Q3. We paid $17 million in dividends, had capital expenses of $63 million, and ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $1.3 billion and no short-term debt. Inventory decreased to $191 million. DSO in the quarter decreased to 65 days. We had one 10% customer in the quarter. At the business unit level, Semi Test sales were $592 million, up 49% from Q3 2019. SOC shipments were $449 million and memory test had record shipments at $143 million. Semi Test saw strength in mobility and compute applications in SOC where we continued to ramp our UltraFLEXplus test system. In Memory, we saw broad shipments across flash and our Magnum EPIC solution enabled continued strength in DRAM. We expect these products to continue to gain new applications as market acceptance has been very encouraging to-date, and they're well-aligned to technology trends in both SOC and memory tests. As Mark noted, the automotive microcontroller and analog markets remained at historically low levels in 2020. But we did see some pickup in the analog markets in Q3 versus our expectations. Several analog companies have outperformed their expected results, and we are seeing some unexpected short lead time demand as a result. Shifting to System Test. Sales in the quarter were up 61%, from Q3 2019 to $118 million. Storage test was the star at $76 million as both HDD and system level test delivered strong results. Defence and aerospace and production board test combined to deliver $43 million in the quarter. Rounding out the test portfolio, after a very strong second quarter, LitePoint sales softened to $41 million down 4% from the Q3 2019 level. Industrial Automation revenue was $69 million flat from Q3 2019 and growth of 17% quarter-over-quarter. UR contributed $53 million, MiR $10 million, and AG and Energid made up the remainder. While the COVID pandemic has negatively impacted our go-to-market efforts in industrial automation, we are seeing signs of improvement in several geographies across the globe, and some seeing year-over-year increases in sales. These positive signs in different territories should be balanced by a continued uncertainty tied to COVID-19 in predicting the pace of the global recovery and IA over the short-term. Turning to the impact of COVID-19. At Teradyne, our priorities remain consistent during the coronavirus pandemic: safety of our employees, supporting our customers, and a focus on execution to achieve our financial objectives. In line with my prior earnings call remarks; I want to acknowledge the continued challenges during the pandemic that our employees, customers, suppliers, and their families are going through. Operationally we continue to work through supply line issues in the quarter. And again, I must recognize the incredible work and skill of our operations team and our supplier partners to successfully overcome a wide variety of challenges to meet our customer requirements. Great execution also by our engineering teams in introducing new products and delivering products during the quarter, while overcoming significant supply chain issues along the way. In late October, we're in a much better spot than six months ago. That said there's still uncertainty of how this pandemic will impact global supply chains and market demand going forward. We still expect to encounter spot shortages and other issues through the remainder of the year and likely into 2021. Our guidance range continues to be wider than typical to reflect the potential impacts of these uncertainties and some short-lead time business noted earlier. Our test portfolio continues to execute, grow share and revenues. As a result, we are investing alongside our contract manufacturers to increase capacity and resilience in our supply chain. Specific actions include building larger buffer stocks and some components and increasing the geographic diversity of our supply and contract manufacturing. During the pandemic, we reduced our OpEx spending, types to travel, Trade Shows, and other go-to-market activities. The savings were approximately $8 million to $10 million per quarter. Post the pandemic, when returning to normal, we expect these expenditures to come back to our P&L. Moving to the outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect revenue of $680 million to $740 million and a non-GAAP EPS of $0.90 to $1.06 on 175 million diluted shares. This guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles, and non-cash imputed interest on convertible debt. In prior guidance, I noted headwinds on gross margin in the second half of the year before returning to historical levels in 2021. I'm happy to report we're ahead of that plan and gross margins are now expected to be 58% to 59% in Q4, up from 56% in Q3. The earlier than expected improvement in margins is driven by increased volume, improved mix, and supply chain execution in our new product ramps. In Q4, we expect operating expenses to be 29% to 31% of sales. The operating profit at the mid-point of our Q4 guidance is 29%. As Mark noted, you can see we've been positively surprised by both SOC and memory test demand since our last call. Continued strength in mobility test solutions for several customers was the primary driver, but we've also seen unforecasted demand with expedited lead times elsewhere in our test portfolio. For example, analog solutions utilizing our Eagle test systems and DRAM memory applications for our Magnum EPIC systems have also driven up demand in Q4. We have seen this pattern play out over the last several months. Looking at the full-year from a financial perspective, short-term slowdown in IA has been more than offset by the growth in our test businesses. At the mid-point of our Q4 guidance, our 2020 revenues should be above $3.1 billion and non-GAAP EPS will be approximately $4.50. Gross margin for the full-year should be above 57%, down from 58% in 2019, reflecting the impact of high semiconductor shipments for mobility, along with a short-term impact of faster than expected ramps of new products. Our 2020 non-GAAP operating profit rate will be in the high 20s, up from 25% in 2019. And our full-year tax rate is expected to be 15.5%. Through nine months, we spent $147 million on CapEx and we expect we'll spend $193 million for the full-year. At the start of the pandemic it was unclear as to the depth and the duration of the economic consequences. As a result, we took actions to strengthen our liquidity and cash position. For example, we suspended share buybacks on April 1, and expect to end the year with approximately 175 million diluted shares. Given that share repurchases have historically been a part of our balanced capital allocation strategy we'll update you in our January call on our Capital Return Plan for 2021. Looking ahead, at 2021, from a modeling perspective, macroeconomic conditions, timing of pandemic recovery, and political environment all add uncertainty. The environment and demand uncertainty prevents us from speculating on 2021 market sizes. But at a high-level we expect gross margins to return to historical levels and OpEx to grow. From a longer term model perspective, you can see that at the mid-point of our Q4 guidance will be inside the revenue range and above the EPS range of our 2022 earnings model. We'll provide you an update of the earnings model in our January call. To summarize, we closeout Q3 with outstanding financial and operational performance in a difficult working environment, and I again, thank our employees and partners for their incredible efforts. We entered Q4 with a forecast of higher than expected sales and earnings on the strength of mobility and memory. For the full-year share gains in Semi Test and increased traction in our storage business enable us to exit the year stronger than when we entered. The industrial automation market is showing early signs of improvement and we continue to invest in this segment as we monitor the market progress closely. While we're not immune to the macroeconomic shocks and our market visibility is limited, as you've seen since early July, overall, we feel good about our execution during 2020 in a challenging environment. It's too early to estimate demand in 2021, but we'll be prepared from a product, operation, and balance sheet perspective for whatever comes our way. With that, I'll turn things back to Andy.\nAndy Blanchard: Thanks, Sanjay. Josh we would now like to take some questions. And as a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. Please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question or comment comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nVivek Arya: All right. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the strong results and your execution. Mark, I'm curious how much did 5G contribute to your results in calendar 2020 versus what you thought at the start of the year? And the context says that your large mobility customer now already has all their models with 5G and I think the U.S. ones already feature Millimeter Wave. So does it mean that going forward, you're more dependent on unit growth rather than content growth at least when it comes to mobility-related functions? So just what -- what is the 5G TAM as you see it now and where are you in that journey?\nMark Jagiela: Yes. So just to refresh on the 5G TAM, we've been talking about a $400 million adder to the market. And we're roughly 200, 250 into that $400 million adder and we expect that will peak out in the 2023/2024 timeframe as the -- in that timeframe, we would expect most greater than 50% of cell phones would have Millimeter Wave capability built-in. And that would run at that $400 million level for three or four years. So that -- that's sort of a baseline. Where we are this year was, just on the 5G content of cell phones, it's probably about $50 million higher than we expected this year, so certainly, more than we expected, but not dramatically more. So instead of the market being at what we might have thought a $200 million market it may be closer to $250 million. Now, the other point you make about, without speaking to any specific customer situation, the market in terms of test equipment for 5G is facilitated to support about 300 million -- maybe 250 million units of 5G capability. And so it's still a small fraction of what will happen over the next few years. So now, Teradyne's concentration is a different matter. But I do think, for the market that remains out there, the other 1.25 billion phones that are going to move to 5G over the next few years, you can assume that our market share in that space is roughly 50%. So we're pretty concentrated in what happened this year, but we have a very good position in what's happening over the next few.\nVivek Arya: And for my follow-up, I know you're not giving, specific 2021 outlook, but I'm curious after this very strong year that you had across the board in almost every division and outside of IA, what -- of those markets do you think face a tougher comparison next year. But was there -- were there any one-offs, either from end market or customer or product perspective that you think face tougher comparisons year-on-year as you look into next year, just trend wise. Thank you.\nMark Jagiela: Yes. And it probably sounds like a cop-out, but, no, I don't. All the markets that in test showed growth this year have their own story. And the one thing I would maybe cite that I said in the script that's a bit of a wildcard is the storage test piece where we had a phenomenal year doub -- more than doubling of sales there. If again, if we listen to what customers are telling us, we think that still has room to run, but it's a thin market in terms of the customer base. And that one's a bit more of a wildcard than the others. But I don't see any other one-off issue with what we've seen in 2020 that would sort of say, boy, that's going to be tough to beat next year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Brian Chin from Stifel. Your line is now open.\nBrian Chin: Hi. Good morning, and thanks for letting us ask a few questions. I guess, first, but maybe for you, Mark. Yes, just curious again, is those what you're seeing from a test utilization and/or market breadth standpoint could you at least say a degree of confidence that these stronger market conditions are likely to sustain into next year. And I realize that again, it's early to provide any official outlook on the test TAM, but can you at least give us a directional sense because in a vacuum, if smartphone unit demand growth, say 5% to 10% next year instead of contracting 10% and 5G mix continues to shoot up, is there a reason to think that yours and the market TAM would not grow next year?\nMark Jagiela: Yes. I think in that scenario that you cite, it would hard -- it would be hard to imagine if the market TAM wouldn't grow. And so, but there's so many variables. We've proven to ourselves and to you that we're not even that good at predicting the current quarter or the next one out. And so we're a little more gun shy about speculation I could say. But the issues that you cite around the suppressed unit demand for automotive, cell phones, both are significantly down in units this year, yet test is still jumping out of the gym. So a recovery next year in those two unit volume areas should bode well. But COVID is still out there, the economic situation of the world is unknown. So we're just -- we're not going to go too far out on a limb here and try to speculate.\nBrian Chin: Okay. That's fair enough. And maybe second, just citing the recovery you're seeing in UR sales in 3Q and sounds like that's ongoing into 4Q. I would assume maybe this is occurring absent any real sizable recovery in key markets such as auto. And maybe you can provide more color on the applications and markets that have begun to exhibit some improvement?\nSanjay Mehta: Yes. Hi, it's Sanjay. So just, obviously, we've seen growth quarter-over-quarter and a little bit more color. In UR we grew, in IA 23%, and actually was one of the reasons why we exceeded our guidance this quarter. What we've seen as manufacturing kind of comes back online, we've seen the U.S., Europe and China bode strength. And really it's a function of both growth in the quarter and a couple of those markets we're actually seeing year-over-year growth. And so -- and then also from an AG perspective that continues to grow.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Toshiya Hari Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nToshiya Hari: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the strong quarter and guidance. Mark, I wanted to ask you on market share in both SOC test and memory test. You're clearly executing really well in both segments. On the SOC test side I guess the question is, is the growth that you're seeing in market share this year, primarily due to your largest customer having strong year or are you picking up share elsewhere within SOC test? And then, similarly, on the memory test side, again, very big quarter in Q3. How should we think about sustainability into 2021? Are you seeing when that would support continuity in the current trajectory or should we consider this to be more of a one-off? And I've got a quick follow-up.\nMark Jagiela: Yes. It's a good question because the whole market share year-to-year is very volatile so how do you make any sense out of it. Just to give you an example, Teradyne's market share last year in SOC was probably around 40%, this year it's going to be somewhere in the mid-50s. So what's real? So here's how I would characterize it. Last year's 40% wasn't real, it's probably -- it was probably in terms of real market share closer to the mid-40s. We have -- in this year it'll probably be in, like I said, the mid-50s. But what we have done is pick up real non-customer buying patterns share year-over-year due to designs we had last year and that's to the tune of, let's say, five or six points of real market share. So off that base of 45 last year, this year we're probably really normalized running at -- in the low 50 -- 50 to low 50s is the market share position I'd say we're at today. And there's been a lot going on that influences that. Some buyers of equipment have exited the market like Huawei that causes some systemic shift in share. And in Teradyne's case, we certainly was a huge customer of Teradyne's, but we were -- it was a bit below our average share point. And as that silicon supplier redistributes, that helps us. The UltraFLEXplus has designed into some new segments that we've really not participated in for the past decade, that's real new share. It's also designed into some other segments that are new to us. So under the covers of what looks like mathematically a 40 to 55, let's say, point share gain in 2020, what's really I would say happen as we've gone from mid 40s to 50 to low 50s based on that. In memory, now memory is a market where we see the TAM growing significantly this year, it's gone up $300 million from $600 million to $900 million, about $200 million of that's in DRAM and about $100 million is in flash. And fortunately, we were successful in entering that DRAM segment last year with our new Magnum EPIC. And so we've been able to grow as that DRAM segment has grown this year. And that brings us to -- I'd say our true market share and our reported market share are going to really be close in memory in the low 40s. And what we've said is that given our footprint now with our products and customer base, we legitimately see a way to get that to that 50% level over the next few years. So maybe that's a longwinded answer. But those are the two touch points I can give you.\nToshiya Hari: Thank you for the color. And then, as a quick follow-up, I wanted to ask on industrial automation profitability. I suppose over the past several years, you've been in investment mode in the business growing your distribution network, investing in R&D. I think currently, you're around break-even given muted revenue levels. But how should we think about kind of through cycle profitability in IA and if you could remind us what your long-term margin target is for the IA business, that would be super helpful. Thank you.\nSanjay Mehta: Sure. Hi, it's Sanjay. So one question there, but maybe I'll give you a little bit of color. Recall in 2019, our IA a business had an operating profit of about 10%. We entered the year in 2020 a big investment year, but we expected to be around that same operating profit. COVID hit a lot of the go-to-market OpEx; we reduced obviously, because it was run rated towards the higher revenue levels. And in the first half of the year, we lost money. In Q3, we were slightly profitable and as we've said in Q -- or in Q4, we expect revenues to continue to increase and to grow that profit level. We haven't concluded on our 2021 plan, but my expectation assuming that revenue continues, we're going to then obviously increase some of the go-to-market, obviously, with travel, Trade Shows, et cetera. But the engineering investment has not really wavered from that standpoint. And so we expect to continue to heavily invest in industrial automation. So over the next several years, you would expect that our profitability wouldn't be at kind of a company average because it's still in investment mode as we grow. And then what we said over the horizon is that or -- sorry, over the mid-term, is that we expect the revenues to grow between 20% to 35%.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your line is open.\nC.J. Muse: Yes. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, Mark, wanted to, I guess, go back in time and use your memory because I can't remember. But if you look back to AP, and all of mobility in the kind of 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 period, despite, I guess, some constant issue around, Apple, fully buying your testers, you continue to see strength in that businesses as other players came in. So curious, as you look back in time, around the 4G ramp, and then look forward to 5G, and what you're seeing in terms of silicon content, on the RF side in particular Millimeter Wave as well as some of the processing capabilities required, how does that make you feel around what you think the trajectory of mobility test could look like, over the coming one, two, three years relative to the strength that you're seeing here in 2020?\nMark Jagiela: Yes. Good question. So just put a little bit in perspective. So the TAM, or the test market for mobility, if you go back to, let's say, 2017, 2016 timeframe was roughly a billion dollars of test equipment for mobility. This year, we estimate it will be close to 1.6 billion and that's one data point. And that's in light of lower unit volumes. Another data point I'll give you is that if you look at a 4G phone and add up all the silicon in a typical 4G phone from a few years ago, and say, how -- how much time does it take to test all that silicon? And then you take, let's say, a high-end 5G phone today that are just coming on the market and ask the question, how long does it take to test all of that silicon and all I'm talking about now is the RF content in the apps processor. I'm not talking about the cameras and the power management and all that other stuff. It's up about 60% on a per unit phone basis, and we're just getting into 5G content phones. So you can see that there should be as long as the units stay reasonable on cell phones and 5G keeps rolling out a lot of tailwinds around continued growth of the mobility TAM.\nC.J. Muse: It's very helpful. I guess, as a follow-up question you talked about mid 50's share here in 2020. On the last earnings call, you talked about a target of 60%. And I guess can you kind of speak to what can bridge those five points, particularly around anything you can say around wins with UltraFLEXplus as well as the fact that auto and linear are probably down 35% this year versus last year? So I would say simply right there that could bridge you to 60 in 2021. Thank you.\nMark Jagiela: Yes. So just on the shift. First of all, I'm not going to use -- as I mentioned earlier, 55 as our normalized share right now, I'd say it's somewhere around 50 plus or minus. So how do we get 10 more points, this is probably the right way to think about it. And there's a clear path there in my mind. So one piece of it is, as you cited, when automotive and linear comes back that's a place where we have higher than normal market share and that will be a bit of inflator to our share. The UltraFLEXplus though is a key component of the strategy. We've already secured some segments that we've not participated in in a long time; they're just beginning to ramp this year. So that platform designing into those segments alone should bring us halfway at least to that 60 or to extra 10 points you need to get there. So if analog brings us a couple of points and the UltraFLEXplus brings us maybe another five, now we're talking -- we're up in that sort of seven-ish range. And then the last piece that I alluded to in my script is there's this and this is another UltraFLEXplus story, I think. But edge AI devices are growing, our position there is encouraging. And I see that that segment has it establishes itself, if we can get that early design wins to kind of ramp with that growth of devices at the 60% share kind of level that can pull us the rest of the way. But we're talking -- by the way, we're talking maybe this is five years, six year journey, it's not something that's around the corner.\nAndy Blanchard: Can we have the next question, please? Operator?\nOperator: Yes, sir. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. Your line is open.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes, sir. Thanks for taking the question. Couple of follow-ups regarding your Q3. So if upgrading some of the install testers that last year were useful, Huawei helped with the semi services, how should I think about looking forward and its impact on the SOC tester. To what extent system upgrades of the past six months would have an adverse impact on new SOC tests demand? And as a second question or follow-up, can you elaborate on the mix of HDD system and to what extent a strength in advanced packaging like chiplets have impacted, any detailed color that would help us separate HDD from system level test would be great. Thank you.\nSanjay Mehta: Yes. Hi, Mehdi. It's Sanjay. I'll take the first one. So from a services perspective, yes, in the quarter we did see some drop in our surprise [ph] demand and really some of it was tied to the upgrade of kind of existing testers that are being reconfigured at OSATs to test other silicon providers, silicon. And it was very high quarter from a services perspective. We did have some increases on new testers as well. But we expect that business to kind of continue at or -- once we get through I would say the migration or repurposing of existing testers at the OSATs for other customers. So we expect that to be a little bit up in the very short-term to get back to normal over the mid-term.\nMehdi Hosseini: And then the HDD and SLT?\nMark Jagiela: Yes. So on HDD and SLT, so roughly the way to think about it is, today the revenue split there is almost 50-50, it fluctuates, but roughly 50-50. Going forward, there's a lot -- there's actually upside on both sides of this. So on the HDD side, what really has been driving that business historically has been exabyte growth rates. But the -- this is a similar story to test intensity. These 18 plus giga -- terabyte plus drives that are being produced and the roadmaps that we have, have rather sophisticated electronics to allow for high density, error-free read-write operations that require more test intensity. So we're getting a multiplicative effect on the HDD side a bit on top of exabyte growth. So we are optimistic that that leg of the stool in storage test can continue to grow. SLT is a little more of our hardest to --\nAndy Blanchard: Operator, we're getting some noise here, by the way.\nMark Jagiela: And so the -- on the other side of it, the SLT side, chiplets and things like that, certainly, that complexity presents an opportunity for more system level tests, testing the module, so to speak, before they go into a higher value-added sub-assembly is going to be a premium. So that's good theory. And we're in various trials around various customers to see if economically it makes sense to -- for those class apart add a test insertion. It's made sense for some mobility parts, but remember those are billions of units a year. So the question really that we didn't -- we haven't gone out on a limb yet and really answered for ourselves is how far down the unit volume equation can SLT go to make sense. So that one I'd say it's still a bit of a wildcard.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question and comment comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citi. Your line is open.\nAtif Malik: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one for Mark. Mark, if you can remind us about your opportunity on the compute side. There's a discussion that the buy side is for the CPUs for North American customer notebooks next year could be three to five times larger than what's used in tablets. Can you just talk us -- talk about the compute opportunity for Teradyne this year, next year?\nMark Jagiela: Well, compute is an area that Teradyne really hasn't participated in since the '90s. The UltraFLEXplus was specifically designed to give us that opportunity to break back into that segment. And again, roughly just to give you numbers, you can think of compute as somewhere in that $600 million a year TAM in the total market right now. I expect that's going to grow because the diversity of suppliers of compute devices is growing. There's a bit of a disaggregation of the supply chain for compute devices. So the UltraFLEXplus is targeted there. It's had some success already in that mission and we expect that will continue. So I do think it's a rich area for us, but to put it in perspective, it's a market that's about maybe around $600 million on average now could grow to $800 million in the next year or two.\nAtif Malik: Great. And then, Sanjay, there was no material impact to your sales from military end-use China restrictions like you talked about. But can you talk about if the demand from domestic China's semiconductors memory and logic was higher than what you expected in both Q3 and Q4, and how big is domestic China's semiconductors as percentage of the total sales?\nSanjay Mehta: Yes. So maybe I'll start with the end. So roughly 15% in Q3 of our sales we're trying to base. And so it's true that with the regulations either tied to Huawei or discussions about SMIC or the military end-use. Really from a military end-use perspective, there's a tremendous amount of internal compliance work that we're doing to ensure that we are compliant with the regulations and it has not had a material impact on our revenue stream. And I think in earlier remarks, we've made is that as the end-market remained the same and the silicon -- different silicon providers are providing solution for that end market, we feel good about our position on that front. So it's a -- there are some short-term disruptions, we talked about service upgrades for testers that are being redeployed at the OSATs that we're servicing high silicon solutions and now we're going to be servicing other solutions. So that's the type of stuff we're seeing in the short-term. But in the long-term, we feel good about our position because we see it as a share shift where we're positioned well. Operator Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Krish Sankar from Cowen and Company. Your line is open.\nKrish Sankar: Yes. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. Mark thanks for the qualitative color on calendar 2021. And I understand it's very hard to quantify it at this time. But if you look at the SOC test market, it's kind of grown for the last four or five years, a lot of it is because of increased complexity, but the memory test market in the last four years has been more cyclical up and down. Do you think memory is at an inflection where you could see as LPDDR5 and everything else comes along that you might be in a prolonged strength for memory like SOC? And then I had a follow-up.\nMark Jagiela: Yes. So on memory, you're right. Absolutely, it's been cyclical for the past two years. There are good compelling arguments that it could be pretty less volatile and more sustained high-level investments over the next few. Certainly our memory team believes that. And because of LPDDR5 and DDR5 transitions that are eminent, that's going to compel a lot of investment on the DRAM side. So I just don't see the downside in memory nearly as typical as we've seen in the past decade. I think the DRAM story alone is going to keep the memory market pretty healthy. So then the question is flash. And flash is a tougher one to read. The only thing I'd say that's encouraging is this relentless innovation around the interface speeds of flash drives a lot of tester demand and drives obsolescence of the fleet and the roadmaps there are pretty robust. These cell phones and the camera systems in the cell phones just generate an incredible amount of data that needs to be quickly moved in and out of flash. So I'm kind of optimistic that memory in the next four years won't be as volatile as it's been, let's say, in the last four or five.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Thanks Mark. It's helpful. And then as a follow-up, on the industrial automation side how much of your IA revenues are from the auto vertical and how much are coming from small and medium businesses?\nMark Jagiela: 35%.\nSanjay Mehta: Yes, so from an -- Sanjay here. So from the auto perspective, it's in the neighbourhood of 35%. And sorry, your second question?\nKrish Sankar: How much from SMB?\nAndy Blanchard: Small and medium sized businesses.\nSanjay Mehta: I don't know. We'd have to dig that one out. But it's been running in that sort of, I'd say, 75% range, so it's still the vast majority of our sales. The larger enterprises have been a growing percentage over the past three to four years, but that's a rough number.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nJohn Pitzer: Yes. Good morning, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Mark, just a follow-up to Mehdi's earlier question on Huawei. Now to the extent that they were historically a large customer and a lot of those testers here sitting at OSATs and can be repurposed, I'm just kind of curious do you -- how much insight you have into kind of that installed base and its ability to move to additional customers or new customers? And, I guess, are you putting up these results, despite the fact of that or is that something that we need to kind of worry about in future quarters?\nMark Jagiela: So we have decent visibility into the utilization of those testers, but the high-level picture I give you is, let's say there's 100 testers out there for Huawei that we're testing a billion parts a year. As Huawei ends up unable to supply those billion parts the first -- the jerk reaction is, oh, that's 100 idle testers, they got to go somewhere. But the fact of the matter is that somebody else has to supply those billion parts because the end user demand isn't changing that much because of this. So -- and typically by the way those suppliers at the moment are outside of China suppliers that are filling in that billion unit gap to do this analogy. So that we -- and then those testers that are idle, just sort of shift from testing parts that had the high silicon Huawei brand stamp on them to testing parts that have these other suppliers' brands on them, but they're very similar in nature. So the upgrades to facilitate that shift of the fleet over to those new sources of supply started in earnest in Q3. And so despite the fact that there's already repurposing happening at a pretty good clip of those testers, we're putting up the numbers we put up and we're guiding the numbers we're guiding, and we expect that will continue in Q4. When will that entire fleet get repurposed is kind of the last ending question in that, and that's hard to tell. We may end up not seeing that fully flushed out until somewhere in the second quarter of next year.\nJohn Pitzer: That's really helpful. And then, Mark, as my follow-up, in the quarter, you guys created a new role at the IA division and to put in place there a very credible guy in the form of Greg Smith. I'm wondering if you could spend a little bit of time just kind of helping us understand the rationale and how we should think about this Greg's sort of efforts in IA and what it means the overall strategy there.\nMark Jagiela: Yes. Thank you for asking that because Greg is a very proven exceptional leader who has since driven our semiconductor test business here for the past five years. And it's a significant testament to both what we as a company and Greg personally believes the opportunities are in IA for future growth. And Greg's mission really is in looking at the portfolio we have is to look for areas where we can get leverage, enhance our M&A strategy, look for common investments that will give us both in software and hardware further differentiation and sort of bring more the resources that company to bear on those businesses. Most of them are now through their earn-out phase which gave us a little bit of -- there were little bit of handcuffs on there of how we could think about operating those businesses. But now that that's behind us, we have a lot more degrees of freedom and Greg is going to be a great resource to figure that out for us.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Sidney Ho from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nSidney Ho: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I have two. My first question is on the SOC test market, the mobility is roughly half of the SOC TAM today. I think, Mark, you mentioned 1.6 billion of the 3.3 this year. Can you remind us what are the other main buckets within the SOC test markets and which segments are still below the normal run rate? Maybe help us decide how much below the normal levels in some of those markets be?\nMark Jagiela: Okay. I'll give you the -- sort of the rough numbers. So there's a compute segment that is CPUs and FPGAs, and AI and all that good stuff. That's roughly 600 million that we just spoke about. And it's actually a little bit hot too. I'd say its running. It's another growth segment for some of the reasons I talked about earlier. There's automotive and linear and microcontrollers that this year again, these are rough estimates, but it's roughly around a $200 million to $250 million market. That's less than half of its normal run rate. Now, a normal run rate for that business would be 500-ish million. So that one is certainly and it's down from last year as well. So it's trending down and it's half. And then the last one we track is industrial. Industrial is somewhere like around 300 and it's also down from a normal run rate that might be closer to -- it's not as volatile, but it's probably up in the high 3s to 400 million.\nSidney Ho: Great. That's super helpful. My follow-up question is you talked about an increase in demand for short-term lead time -- lead time businesses in Q3. Does that -- does your 4Q guidance assume any kind of headwinds from any kind of supply constraints in any of the [indiscernible]?\nSanjay Mehta: Right now -- it's Sanjay here. So right now, we're not -- we're -- we believe that there could be some issues that arise. But the last six months has clearly shown us that we can overcome what those hurdles are. Nothing is perfect. But we feel that we're in a very good spot in replenishing our components and manufacturing. And if there are things that come up, we've got some capability to solve those problems. So at this point there's no supply constraint on.\nAndy Blanchard: And operator, we're going to sneak one -- one more in, please.\nOperator: Okay. Sir, our final question or comment comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your line is open.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks for fitting me in, Andy. Thanks. So I have two. The first thing, Mark, I'm still trying to figure out on the SOC SharePoint. The TAM of 3.3, it's not a whole lot different than what you thought it would be at the start of the year. And at that time you thought your share would go from roughly 40% to mid -- to roughly mid-40s. Here we are we're kind of mid-50s this year. So I guess I'm trying to understand where the incremental thousand basis points of share came from. Was this your biggest customer ordering more? Was this something else? If you can double click on that a little bit? And I had a follow-up because it sounds like it's not really 5G; you said that 5G is only like 50 million swing factor for the whole market. So I'm still trying to figure out where that share came from versus your expectations.\nMark Jagiela: Yes. So at the highest, highest level it's just that the market -- the supply side of the semiconductor market has shifted more favorably to our customers. But underneath that, why is that? Well, one thing we didn't see happening when the year started was that further regulations would come in to place on Huawei and drive them out of the market for silicon and test. And since that occurred, what happened as I described a bit earlier was, other suppliers have had to step in and fill the void and were better positioned at those other suppliers. So that is an upside. Our customers, our traditional customers, independent of that particular situation are also buying more than we had forecast. So that is absolutely another piece of the upside. I'd say those are the two most significant ones. And then the third one, which isn't an SOC thing, but I think is a total company thing, is on the memory side, the fact that the market has been so high and that our LPDDR5 ramp has been probably better than we expected, has helped on that side as well.\nTimothy Arcuri: Got it. And then I just -- the -- for my second question. Just on the point about Huawei. So you saw the original bump in the capacity required for Huawei from the OSATs and now you're seeing some boost from upgrades to that fleet. Can you sort of quantify how much of a boost these upgrades are giving you? So I guess how much of the 449 SOC revenue is related to the upgrade of this fleet for non-Huawei OEMs?\nMark Jagiela: Yes. It's less than 10%, but more than 5%.\nAndy Blanchard: Okay. Folks, we are out of time. Thanks so much for joining us again this quarter. And I'll follow-up with folks individually that are still in the queue. Again, thanks so much. Take care.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark Jagiela",
            "content": "Thanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. My prepared remarks today will cover three topics. First, the highlights of our third quarter and first nine months of the year; second, the impacts of the latest trade regulations on Teradyne; and third, I'll share with you how we're thinking about the test and automation markets as we closeout 2020 and look into the next year and beyond. Our third quarter results were above guidance and reflect the continued strength of our test businesses. Additionally, our industrial automation businesses grew 17% from the Q2 trough and we are now operating at 2019 quarterly levels as manufacturing activities in Europe and North America improve. At the company level sales in Q3 were 41% above Q3 2019 and non-GAAP EPS grew 53% from the year ago level. Throughout 2020, we have seen increased short-term upside demand across our Semi Test end markets. The impact of this is clear in both our above guidance results in Q3, and in our Q4 guidance, which at the mid-point is substantially higher than we forecast in July. Throughout 2020, the semiconductor ecosystem has seen somewhat cautious initial forecasts, which were replaced with better than expected actual demand, and tests has been no exception. We continue to run a manufacturing pipeline that allows us to respond to this upside. Stepping back and looking at our performance to the first nine months of the year, the results show the success of our new products and related designing efforts and the resilience of our employees, supply line partners, and operating model. Teradyne sales through nine months are up 44% and our non-GAAP earnings per share are up 79%. Our test businesses collectively grew 52% year-to-date, while industrial automation revenue on a as reported basis contracted 10% reflecting the pandemic impact. In Semi Test, we estimate the SOC market will be about $3.3 billion, roughly flat with 2019's level as automotive, industrial, and linear markets remain depressed. However, our SOC test business is up 53% year-to-date due to strong investments in mobility test, and the shipment of our new UltraFLEXplus platform which is ramping significant design wins. The principal driver of mobility test demand continues to be increases in complexity of cell phone silicon. This is especially notable in 2020, when smartphone unit shipments are expected to decline about 10% to 1.2 billion. Yet the collective test intensity of each unit continues to grow at a rate in excess of this unit decline. Within smartphones, the mid to high tier is the place to be in test and that's where Teradyne is solidly positioned. These phones are seeing disproportionate growth and complexity related to multiple high density camera arrays and the associated processing power and storage to manage this data. Another complexity driver is 5G. And these high tier phones are early adopters of the extra silicon needed to enable these features. Less than 250 million phones are expected to be 5G-enabled in 2020 and only a fraction of those will support millimeter wave communication. So despite the bump in 2020, we are still in the very early stages of 5G adoption. Memory test is another bright spot. The market is likely to be up about 50% from 600 million in 2019 to about 900 million in 2020. The shipment ramp of our Magnum EPIC product LPDDR5 win last year, combined with continued strength in flash demand has driven our year-to-date memory revenues up 70% from 2019. In System Test, revenues are up nearly 50% through nine months on growth in storage test and defense-related investments. Recall storage tests served HDD and System Level Test markets and we expect sales to more than double in 2020 to over $200 million. And at LitePoint, sales are up 18% year-to-date due to increasing adoption of advanced connectivity standards like WiFi, 6E, and our growing share in 5G production test. As noted earlier in industrial automation we saw a significant uptick in demand in Q3 with growth of 17% off the second quarter trough. UR grew 23% as demand in Europe, North America and China showed steady gains. AutoGuide continues to win new accounts and we expect over 50% growth in 2020 on a pro forma basis. Regarding trade, as we noted last quarter, the China military end user restrictions require increased compliance work and costs. But we do not expect any material impact on our sales into China. In the case of Huawei restrictions, the fleet of testers previously installed at OSAT to support their device tests are already being reabsorbed into the market to test the alternative sources of silicon supply that's growing to fill in the gap created by these regulations at Huawei. For example, in the third quarter, we have seen an increase in upgrade orders at these OSAT customers to reconfigure installed testers to meet the unique needs of new customers. This upgrading and repurposing continues into fourth quarter. Shifting to the future, it's difficult to make the call on how 2021 will shape up as it's been difficult to predict 2020 even on a quarterly basis. Customers will likely continue to forecast conservatively and respond close in to demand. However, semiconductor complexity growth has proven itself resilient to COVID and is the fundamental driver of our test business. With that in mind, I'll comment on a few of the key indicators that we will be watching. In SOC test, we will be watching the smartphone market for complexity increases to support higher performance video and still photography, the adoption rate of 5G and Millimeter Wave, AI integration, enhance that unit growth. We'll also be watching the automotive and analog markets for signs of a sustainable recovery in test demand. Longer-term the increase in edge AI devices should drive billions of additional complex chip units into the market by 2025, so early design wins in that area are key. In memory, the transition to higher performance DDR5 standards is just underway and should accelerate in 2021, along with newer high speed UFS and NVMe flash interface. The roadmaps for both flash and DRAM show continued growth in interface speeds, which is another driver of test intensity beyond the traditional bid growth and should drive healthy memory test demand over the mid-term. At LitePoint, the continued growth of WiFi 6, 6E, and ultra-wideband connectivity standards, along with 5G will be drivers for continued growth. A bit further out we expect the next-generation WiFi 7 standard will require another refresh of the entire existing connectivity install base of testers. Consistent test, storage test is the interesting wildcard. After a torrid growth in 2020, the underlying demand drivers remain in place. In HDD both increasing complexity and 30% plus annual exabyte growth. And in system level tests increasing device complexity and higher quality requirements are driving the additional test intensity. However, both are narrow markets and prone to swings in investment levels at individual customers. Our industrial automation businesses are well-aligned to long-term economic and technical trends in manufacturing and material handling so we are confident in their ability to return to high growth. The only question is how quick do the manufacturing economy returns to help. We continue to scale our distribution capability and invest in R&D to widen our leading position. Among other things, AutoGuide adoption by key logistics, e-commerce, retail, and automotive customers in 2021 will set the stage for multiple years of double-digit growth. Despite these comments, as I've noted in the past, we do not spend too much time trying to predict the various short-term demand drivers as they generally don't affect our investment plans. We do spend a lot of time trying to predict the underlying long-term growth drivers. We want to be positioned with the right products at the right customers at the right time. We believe the use of semiconductors across the global economy will continue to expand and chip complexity will grow along with that expansion. Similarly, in industrial automation, the cost performance of the sensor software and mechanical building blocks of advanced automation continues to improve making our products economically attractive to an expanding universe of customers. We have built our strategy on these fundamental beliefs and built our operating model with the flexibility to deal efficiently with the inevitable ups and downs of economic cycles. So while we can't predict what lies ahead in 2021, we finished 2020 on an optimistic note, the company -- across the company, our employees delivered remarkable results under very difficult circumstances. Our new test and AI products are seen strong market acceptance, and our R&D pipelines are well-stocked with future products to drive future growth. With that, I'll turn things over to Sanjay for the financial details. Yes. So just to refresh on the 5G TAM, we've been talking about a $400 million adder to the market. And we're roughly 200, 250 into that $400 million adder and we expect that will peak out in the 2023/2024 timeframe as the -- in that timeframe, we would expect most greater than 50% of cell phones would have Millimeter Wave capability built-in. And that would run at that $400 million level for three or four years. So that -- that's sort of a baseline. Where we are this year was, just on the 5G content of cell phones, it's probably about $50 million higher than we expected this year, so certainly, more than we expected, but not dramatically more. So instead of the market being at what we might have thought a $200 million market it may be closer to $250 million. Now, the other point you make about, without speaking to any specific customer situation, the market in terms of test equipment for 5G is facilitated to support about 300 million -- maybe 250 million units of 5G capability. And so it's still a small fraction of what will happen over the next few years. So now, Teradyne's concentration is a different matter. But I do think, for the market that remains out there, the other 1.25 billion phones that are going to move to 5G over the next few years, you can assume that our market share in that space is roughly 50%. So we're pretty concentrated in what happened this year, but we have a very good position in what's happening over the next few. Yes. And it probably sounds like a cop-out, but, no, I don't. All the markets that in test showed growth this year have their own story. And the one thing I would maybe cite that I said in the script that's a bit of a wildcard is the storage test piece where we had a phenomenal year doub -- more than doubling of sales there. If again, if we listen to what customers are telling us, we think that still has room to run, but it's a thin market in terms of the customer base. And that one's a bit more of a wildcard than the others. But I don't see any other one-off issue with what we've seen in 2020 that would sort of say, boy, that's going to be tough to beat next year. Yes. I think in that scenario that you cite, it would hard -- it would be hard to imagine if the market TAM wouldn't grow. And so, but there's so many variables. We've proven to ourselves and to you that we're not even that good at predicting the current quarter or the next one out. And so we're a little more gun shy about speculation I could say. But the issues that you cite around the suppressed unit demand for automotive, cell phones, both are significantly down in units this year, yet test is still jumping out of the gym. So a recovery next year in those two unit volume areas should bode well. But COVID is still out there, the economic situation of the world is unknown. So we're just -- we're not going to go too far out on a limb here and try to speculate. Yes. It's a good question because the whole market share year-to-year is very volatile so how do you make any sense out of it. Just to give you an example, Teradyne's market share last year in SOC was probably around 40%, this year it's going to be somewhere in the mid-50s. So what's real? So here's how I would characterize it. Last year's 40% wasn't real, it's probably -- it was probably in terms of real market share closer to the mid-40s. We have -- in this year it'll probably be in, like I said, the mid-50s. But what we have done is pick up real non-customer buying patterns share year-over-year due to designs we had last year and that's to the tune of, let's say, five or six points of real market share. So off that base of 45 last year, this year we're probably really normalized running at -- in the low 50 -- 50 to low 50s is the market share position I'd say we're at today. And there's been a lot going on that influences that. Some buyers of equipment have exited the market like Huawei that causes some systemic shift in share. And in Teradyne's case, we certainly was a huge customer of Teradyne's, but we were -- it was a bit below our average share point. And as that silicon supplier redistributes, that helps us. The UltraFLEXplus has designed into some new segments that we've really not participated in for the past decade, that's real new share. It's also designed into some other segments that are new to us. So under the covers of what looks like mathematically a 40 to 55, let's say, point share gain in 2020, what's really I would say happen as we've gone from mid 40s to 50 to low 50s based on that. In memory, now memory is a market where we see the TAM growing significantly this year, it's gone up $300 million from $600 million to $900 million, about $200 million of that's in DRAM and about $100 million is in flash. And fortunately, we were successful in entering that DRAM segment last year with our new Magnum EPIC. And so we've been able to grow as that DRAM segment has grown this year. And that brings us to -- I'd say our true market share and our reported market share are going to really be close in memory in the low 40s. And what we've said is that given our footprint now with our products and customer base, we legitimately see a way to get that to that 50% level over the next few years. So maybe that's a longwinded answer. But those are the two touch points I can give you. Yes. Good question. So just put a little bit in perspective. So the TAM, or the test market for mobility, if you go back to, let's say, 2017, 2016 timeframe was roughly a billion dollars of test equipment for mobility. This year, we estimate it will be close to 1.6 billion and that's one data point. And that's in light of lower unit volumes. Another data point I'll give you is that if you look at a 4G phone and add up all the silicon in a typical 4G phone from a few years ago, and say, how -- how much time does it take to test all that silicon? And then you take, let's say, a high-end 5G phone today that are just coming on the market and ask the question, how long does it take to test all of that silicon and all I'm talking about now is the RF content in the apps processor. I'm not talking about the cameras and the power management and all that other stuff. It's up about 60% on a per unit phone basis, and we're just getting into 5G content phones. So you can see that there should be as long as the units stay reasonable on cell phones and 5G keeps rolling out a lot of tailwinds around continued growth of the mobility TAM. Yes. So just on the shift. First of all, I'm not going to use -- as I mentioned earlier, 55 as our normalized share right now, I'd say it's somewhere around 50 plus or minus. So how do we get 10 more points, this is probably the right way to think about it. And there's a clear path there in my mind. So one piece of it is, as you cited, when automotive and linear comes back that's a place where we have higher than normal market share and that will be a bit of inflator to our share. The UltraFLEXplus though is a key component of the strategy. We've already secured some segments that we've not participated in in a long time; they're just beginning to ramp this year. So that platform designing into those segments alone should bring us halfway at least to that 60 or to extra 10 points you need to get there. So if analog brings us a couple of points and the UltraFLEXplus brings us maybe another five, now we're talking -- we're up in that sort of seven-ish range. And then the last piece that I alluded to in my script is there's this and this is another UltraFLEXplus story, I think. But edge AI devices are growing, our position there is encouraging. And I see that that segment has it establishes itself, if we can get that early design wins to kind of ramp with that growth of devices at the 60% share kind of level that can pull us the rest of the way. But we're talking -- by the way, we're talking maybe this is five years, six year journey, it's not something that's around the corner. Yes. So on HDD and SLT, so roughly the way to think about it is, today the revenue split there is almost 50-50, it fluctuates, but roughly 50-50. Going forward, there's a lot -- there's actually upside on both sides of this. So on the HDD side, what really has been driving that business historically has been exabyte growth rates. But the -- this is a similar story to test intensity. These 18 plus giga -- terabyte plus drives that are being produced and the roadmaps that we have, have rather sophisticated electronics to allow for high density, error-free read-write operations that require more test intensity. So we're getting a multiplicative effect on the HDD side a bit on top of exabyte growth. So we are optimistic that that leg of the stool in storage test can continue to grow. SLT is a little more of our hardest to -- And so the -- on the other side of it, the SLT side, chiplets and things like that, certainly, that complexity presents an opportunity for more system level tests, testing the module, so to speak, before they go into a higher value-added sub-assembly is going to be a premium. So that's good theory. And we're in various trials around various customers to see if economically it makes sense to -- for those class apart add a test insertion. It's made sense for some mobility parts, but remember those are billions of units a year. So the question really that we didn't -- we haven't gone out on a limb yet and really answered for ourselves is how far down the unit volume equation can SLT go to make sense. So that one I'd say it's still a bit of a wildcard. Well, compute is an area that Teradyne really hasn't participated in since the '90s. The UltraFLEXplus was specifically designed to give us that opportunity to break back into that segment. And again, roughly just to give you numbers, you can think of compute as somewhere in that $600 million a year TAM in the total market right now. I expect that's going to grow because the diversity of suppliers of compute devices is growing. There's a bit of a disaggregation of the supply chain for compute devices. So the UltraFLEXplus is targeted there. It's had some success already in that mission and we expect that will continue. So I do think it's a rich area for us, but to put it in perspective, it's a market that's about maybe around $600 million on average now could grow to $800 million in the next year or two. Yes. So on memory, you're right. Absolutely, it's been cyclical for the past two years. There are good compelling arguments that it could be pretty less volatile and more sustained high-level investments over the next few. Certainly our memory team believes that. And because of LPDDR5 and DDR5 transitions that are eminent, that's going to compel a lot of investment on the DRAM side. So I just don't see the downside in memory nearly as typical as we've seen in the past decade. I think the DRAM story alone is going to keep the memory market pretty healthy. So then the question is flash. And flash is a tougher one to read. The only thing I'd say that's encouraging is this relentless innovation around the interface speeds of flash drives a lot of tester demand and drives obsolescence of the fleet and the roadmaps there are pretty robust. These cell phones and the camera systems in the cell phones just generate an incredible amount of data that needs to be quickly moved in and out of flash. So I'm kind of optimistic that memory in the next four years won't be as volatile as it's been, let's say, in the last four or five. 35%. So we have decent visibility into the utilization of those testers, but the high-level picture I give you is, let's say there's 100 testers out there for Huawei that we're testing a billion parts a year. As Huawei ends up unable to supply those billion parts the first -- the jerk reaction is, oh, that's 100 idle testers, they got to go somewhere. But the fact of the matter is that somebody else has to supply those billion parts because the end user demand isn't changing that much because of this. So -- and typically by the way those suppliers at the moment are outside of China suppliers that are filling in that billion unit gap to do this analogy. So that we -- and then those testers that are idle, just sort of shift from testing parts that had the high silicon Huawei brand stamp on them to testing parts that have these other suppliers' brands on them, but they're very similar in nature. So the upgrades to facilitate that shift of the fleet over to those new sources of supply started in earnest in Q3. And so despite the fact that there's already repurposing happening at a pretty good clip of those testers, we're putting up the numbers we put up and we're guiding the numbers we're guiding, and we expect that will continue in Q4. When will that entire fleet get repurposed is kind of the last ending question in that, and that's hard to tell. We may end up not seeing that fully flushed out until somewhere in the second quarter of next year. Yes. Thank you for asking that because Greg is a very proven exceptional leader who has since driven our semiconductor test business here for the past five years. And it's a significant testament to both what we as a company and Greg personally believes the opportunities are in IA for future growth. And Greg's mission really is in looking at the portfolio we have is to look for areas where we can get leverage, enhance our M&A strategy, look for common investments that will give us both in software and hardware further differentiation and sort of bring more the resources that company to bear on those businesses. Most of them are now through their earn-out phase which gave us a little bit of -- there were little bit of handcuffs on there of how we could think about operating those businesses. But now that that's behind us, we have a lot more degrees of freedom and Greg is going to be a great resource to figure that out for us. Okay. I'll give you the -- sort of the rough numbers. So there's a compute segment that is CPUs and FPGAs, and AI and all that good stuff. That's roughly 600 million that we just spoke about. And it's actually a little bit hot too. I'd say its running. It's another growth segment for some of the reasons I talked about earlier. There's automotive and linear and microcontrollers that this year again, these are rough estimates, but it's roughly around a $200 million to $250 million market. That's less than half of its normal run rate. Now, a normal run rate for that business would be 500-ish million. So that one is certainly and it's down from last year as well. So it's trending down and it's half. And then the last one we track is industrial. Industrial is somewhere like around 300 and it's also down from a normal run rate that might be closer to -- it's not as volatile, but it's probably up in the high 3s to 400 million. Yes. So at the highest, highest level it's just that the market -- the supply side of the semiconductor market has shifted more favorably to our customers. But underneath that, why is that? Well, one thing we didn't see happening when the year started was that further regulations would come in to place on Huawei and drive them out of the market for silicon and test. And since that occurred, what happened as I described a bit earlier was, other suppliers have had to step in and fill the void and were better positioned at those other suppliers. So that is an upside. Our customers, our traditional customers, independent of that particular situation are also buying more than we had forecast. So that is absolutely another piece of the upside. I'd say those are the two most significant ones. And then the third one, which isn't an SOC thing, but I think is a total company thing, is on the memory side, the fact that the market has been so high and that our LPDDR5 ramp has been probably better than we expected, has helped on that side as well. Yes. It's less than 10%, but more than 5%."

            "name": "Sanjay Mehta",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark, and hello everyone. In my remarks I'll review our Q3 financial results, comments on how COVID is impacting our business, provide Q4 guidance, and comment on our full-year financial outlook at the mid-point of our Q4 guidance. Our third quarter sales of $819 million were just above the high-end of the guidance range, which enabled a 30% non-GAAP operating margin and a $1.18 non-GAAP EPS, which is also above the high-end of our range. Strengthen in Semi Test and storage test were the revenue highlight. Improved profit was a result of higher sales, partially offset by a higher than forecasted tax rate. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $211 million and our non-GAAP diluted share count in the quarter was $175 million. In Q3, our non-GAAP tax rate was 17.4%, which included a year-to-date catch-up as our estimated 2020 annual non-GAAP tax rate increase to 15.5% from our prior forecast of 14.5%. The increased tax rate is driven by higher foreign earnings, which resulted in an increase in the U.S. minimum tax on foreign earnings. We generated $280 million in free cash flow in Q3. We paid $17 million in dividends, had capital expenses of $63 million, and ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities of approximately $1.3 billion and no short-term debt. Inventory decreased to $191 million. DSO in the quarter decreased to 65 days. We had one 10% customer in the quarter. At the business unit level, Semi Test sales were $592 million, up 49% from Q3 2019. SOC shipments were $449 million and memory test had record shipments at $143 million. Semi Test saw strength in mobility and compute applications in SOC where we continued to ramp our UltraFLEXplus test system. In Memory, we saw broad shipments across flash and our Magnum EPIC solution enabled continued strength in DRAM. We expect these products to continue to gain new applications as market acceptance has been very encouraging to-date, and they're well-aligned to technology trends in both SOC and memory tests. As Mark noted, the automotive microcontroller and analog markets remained at historically low levels in 2020. But we did see some pickup in the analog markets in Q3 versus our expectations. Several analog companies have outperformed their expected results, and we are seeing some unexpected short lead time demand as a result. Shifting to System Test. Sales in the quarter were up 61%, from Q3 2019 to $118 million. Storage test was the star at $76 million as both HDD and system level test delivered strong results. Defence and aerospace and production board test combined to deliver $43 million in the quarter. Rounding out the test portfolio, after a very strong second quarter, LitePoint sales softened to $41 million down 4% from the Q3 2019 level. Industrial Automation revenue was $69 million flat from Q3 2019 and growth of 17% quarter-over-quarter. UR contributed $53 million, MiR $10 million, and AG and Energid made up the remainder. While the COVID pandemic has negatively impacted our go-to-market efforts in industrial automation, we are seeing signs of improvement in several geographies across the globe, and some seeing year-over-year increases in sales. These positive signs in different territories should be balanced by a continued uncertainty tied to COVID-19 in predicting the pace of the global recovery and IA over the short-term. Turning to the impact of COVID-19. At Teradyne, our priorities remain consistent during the coronavirus pandemic: safety of our employees, supporting our customers, and a focus on execution to achieve our financial objectives. In line with my prior earnings call remarks; I want to acknowledge the continued challenges during the pandemic that our employees, customers, suppliers, and their families are going through. Operationally we continue to work through supply line issues in the quarter. And again, I must recognize the incredible work and skill of our operations team and our supplier partners to successfully overcome a wide variety of challenges to meet our customer requirements. Great execution also by our engineering teams in introducing new products and delivering products during the quarter, while overcoming significant supply chain issues along the way. In late October, we're in a much better spot than six months ago. That said there's still uncertainty of how this pandemic will impact global supply chains and market demand going forward. We still expect to encounter spot shortages and other issues through the remainder of the year and likely into 2021. Our guidance range continues to be wider than typical to reflect the potential impacts of these uncertainties and some short-lead time business noted earlier. Our test portfolio continues to execute, grow share and revenues. As a result, we are investing alongside our contract manufacturers to increase capacity and resilience in our supply chain. Specific actions include building larger buffer stocks and some components and increasing the geographic diversity of our supply and contract manufacturing. During the pandemic, we reduced our OpEx spending, types to travel, Trade Shows, and other go-to-market activities. The savings were approximately $8 million to $10 million per quarter. Post the pandemic, when returning to normal, we expect these expenditures to come back to our P&L. Moving to the outlook for the fourth quarter. We expect revenue of $680 million to $740 million and a non-GAAP EPS of $0.90 to $1.06 on 175 million diluted shares. This guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles, and non-cash imputed interest on convertible debt. In prior guidance, I noted headwinds on gross margin in the second half of the year before returning to historical levels in 2021. I'm happy to report we're ahead of that plan and gross margins are now expected to be 58% to 59% in Q4, up from 56% in Q3. The earlier than expected improvement in margins is driven by increased volume, improved mix, and supply chain execution in our new product ramps. In Q4, we expect operating expenses to be 29% to 31% of sales. The operating profit at the mid-point of our Q4 guidance is 29%. As Mark noted, you can see we've been positively surprised by both SOC and memory test demand since our last call. Continued strength in mobility test solutions for several customers was the primary driver, but we've also seen unforecasted demand with expedited lead times elsewhere in our test portfolio. For example, analog solutions utilizing our Eagle test systems and DRAM memory applications for our Magnum EPIC systems have also driven up demand in Q4. We have seen this pattern play out over the last several months. Looking at the full-year from a financial perspective, short-term slowdown in IA has been more than offset by the growth in our test businesses. At the mid-point of our Q4 guidance, our 2020 revenues should be above $3.1 billion and non-GAAP EPS will be approximately $4.50. Gross margin for the full-year should be above 57%, down from 58% in 2019, reflecting the impact of high semiconductor shipments for mobility, along with a short-term impact of faster than expected ramps of new products. Our 2020 non-GAAP operating profit rate will be in the high 20s, up from 25% in 2019. And our full-year tax rate is expected to be 15.5%. Through nine months, we spent $147 million on CapEx and we expect we'll spend $193 million for the full-year. At the start of the pandemic it was unclear as to the depth and the duration of the economic consequences. As a result, we took actions to strengthen our liquidity and cash position. For example, we suspended share buybacks on April 1, and expect to end the year with approximately 175 million diluted shares. Given that share repurchases have historically been a part of our balanced capital allocation strategy we'll update you in our January call on our Capital Return Plan for 2021. Looking ahead, at 2021, from a modeling perspective, macroeconomic conditions, timing of pandemic recovery, and political environment all add uncertainty. The environment and demand uncertainty prevents us from speculating on 2021 market sizes. But at a high-level we expect gross margins to return to historical levels and OpEx to grow. From a longer term model perspective, you can see that at the mid-point of our Q4 guidance will be inside the revenue range and above the EPS range of our 2022 earnings model. We'll provide you an update of the earnings model in our January call. To summarize, we closeout Q3 with outstanding financial and operational performance in a difficult working environment, and I again, thank our employees and partners for their incredible efforts. We entered Q4 with a forecast of higher than expected sales and earnings on the strength of mobility and memory. For the full-year share gains in Semi Test and increased traction in our storage business enable us to exit the year stronger than when we entered. The industrial automation market is showing early signs of improvement and we continue to invest in this segment as we monitor the market progress closely. While we're not immune to the macroeconomic shocks and our market visibility is limited, as you've seen since early July, overall, we feel good about our execution during 2020 in a challenging environment. It's too early to estimate demand in 2021, but we'll be prepared from a product, operation, and balance sheet perspective for whatever comes our way. With that, I'll turn things back to Andy. Yes. Hi, it's Sanjay. So just, obviously, we've seen growth quarter-over-quarter and a little bit more color. In UR we grew, in IA 23%, and actually was one of the reasons why we exceeded our guidance this quarter. What we've seen as manufacturing kind of comes back online, we've seen the U.S., Europe and China bode strength. And really it's a function of both growth in the quarter and a couple of those markets we're actually seeing year-over-year growth. And so -- and then also from an AG perspective that continues to grow. Sure. Hi, it's Sanjay. So one question there, but maybe I'll give you a little bit of color. Recall in 2019, our IA a business had an operating profit of about 10%. We entered the year in 2020 a big investment year, but we expected to be around that same operating profit. COVID hit a lot of the go-to-market OpEx; we reduced obviously, because it was run rated towards the higher revenue levels. And in the first half of the year, we lost money. In Q3, we were slightly profitable and as we've said in Q -- or in Q4, we expect revenues to continue to increase and to grow that profit level. We haven't concluded on our 2021 plan, but my expectation assuming that revenue continues, we're going to then obviously increase some of the go-to-market, obviously, with travel, Trade Shows, et cetera. But the engineering investment has not really wavered from that standpoint. And so we expect to continue to heavily invest in industrial automation. So over the next several years, you would expect that our profitability wouldn't be at kind of a company average because it's still in investment mode as we grow. And then what we said over the horizon is that or -- sorry, over the mid-term, is that we expect the revenues to grow between 20% to 35%. Yes. Hi, Mehdi. It's Sanjay. I'll take the first one. So from a services perspective, yes, in the quarter we did see some drop in our surprise [ph] demand and really some of it was tied to the upgrade of kind of existing testers that are being reconfigured at OSATs to test other silicon providers, silicon. And it was very high quarter from a services perspective. We did have some increases on new testers as well. But we expect that business to kind of continue at or -- once we get through I would say the migration or repurposing of existing testers at the OSATs for other customers. So we expect that to be a little bit up in the very short-term to get back to normal over the mid-term. Yes. So maybe I'll start with the end. So roughly 15% in Q3 of our sales we're trying to base. And so it's true that with the regulations either tied to Huawei or discussions about SMIC or the military end-use. Really from a military end-use perspective, there's a tremendous amount of internal compliance work that we're doing to ensure that we are compliant with the regulations and it has not had a material impact on our revenue stream. And I think in earlier remarks, we've made is that as the end-market remained the same and the silicon -- different silicon providers are providing solution for that end market, we feel good about our position on that front. So it's a -- there are some short-term disruptions, we talked about service upgrades for testers that are being redeployed at the OSATs that we're servicing high silicon solutions and now we're going to be servicing other solutions. So that's the type of stuff we're seeing in the short-term. But in the long-term, we feel good about our position because we see it as a share shift where we're positioned well. Operator Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from the line of Krish Sankar from Cowen and Company. Your line is open. Yes, so from an -- Sanjay here. So from the auto perspective, it's in the neighbourhood of 35%. And sorry, your second question? I don't know. We'd have to dig that one out. But it's been running in that sort of, I'd say, 75% range, so it's still the vast majority of our sales. The larger enterprises have been a growing percentage over the past three to four years, but that's a rough number. Right now -- it's Sanjay here. So right now, we're not -- we're -- we believe that there could be some issues that arise. But the last six months has clearly shown us that we can overcome what those hurdles are. Nothing is perfect. But we feel that we're in a very good spot in replenishing our components and manufacturing. And if there are things that come up, we've got some capability to solve those problems. So at this point there's no supply constraint on."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Andy Blanchard, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAndy Blanchard: Thank you, Vincent. Good morning everyone, and welcome to our discussion of Teradyne's most recent financial results. I'm joined this morning by our CEO, Mark Jagiela; and the CFO, Sanjay Mehta. Following our opening remarks, we'll provide details of our performance for 2020's second quarter along with our outlook for the third quarter of 2020. The press release containing our second quarter results was issued last evening. We're providing slides on the Investor page of the website that may be helpful to you in following the discussion. Replay of this call will be available via the same page after the call ends. The matters that we discuss today will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause Teradyne's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statements contained in the earnings release as well as our most recent SEC filings. Additionally, those forward-looking statements are made as of today and we take no obligation to update them as a result of developments occurring after this call. During today's call, we'll make reference to non-GAAP financial measures. We have posted additional information concerning these non-GAAP financial measures including reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, where available on the Investor page of our website. Also, please take special note of the Safe Harbor Statement in the press release and slide deck for risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic and changes to U.S. export regulations. Looking ahead between now and our next earnings call, Teradyne expects to participate in technology or industrial focused investor conferences hosted by KeyBanc, Citibank and Deutsche Bank. Now, let's get on to the rest of the agenda. First, Mark will comment on our recent results and the market conditions including comments on the COVID-19 pandemic and expanded trade regulations. Sanjay will then offer more details on our quarterly results, along with our guidance for the third quarter. We'll then answer your questions. And this call is scheduled for one hour. Mark?\nMark Jagiela: Good morning, everyone. Today I'll summarize our results for the second quarter and the first half of 2020, comment on the impact of current environmental conditions, including new trade regulations and then describe our view of the second half of the year. Sanjay will then provide the financial details on the quarter and our guidance for Q3. Despite the pandemic trade issues and shutdown related headwinds and industrial automation, Teradyne is performing exceptionally well. In the second quarter \u2013 our second quarter results affirmed the trend of growing test intensity and the efficiency of our business model. As you can see from our Q3 guidance, the market demand remains robust. While Q2 saw record SOC shipments, 3Q is being driven by growth in memory test and system level test. Industrial automation continues to pull out of the effects of global industrial shutdowns as we saw sequential monthly growth in sales throughout second quarter. We expect second quarter to be the bottom for IA and 3Q sales to be back close to 2019 levels. Superb execution by the global Teradyne team was on full display in second quarter as we managed to deliver new shipment records and test. Supply line constraints were largely mitigated and remote technical collaboration with both within Teradyne and with our customers continues to show success. It takes dozens to hundreds of engineers working in concert to develop new test products. It takes similar numbers working with customers to launch test programs for new silicon. Flipping a switch to do this remotely without missing a beat is a fantastic accomplishment. And I congratulate and thank all the employees of Teradyne for this achievement. On the trade front, new regulations related to both Huawei and China military end users were announced in the second quarter. We expect the China military end-user restrictions to increase our compliance work and costs, but we currently do not expect any material impact on our sales into China. In the case of Huawei, while the new regulations do not impose any new restrictions on our business with Huawei directly, we expect it will likely impact our business with sub-com customers who test Huawei devices using our test equipment. However, we expect the macro global test demand to be minimally impacted as alternative sources of silicon supply grow to fill in whatever gap is created by these regulations. This alternative supplies should absorb any idled test capacity as well as drive new demand in the future. Shifting to the highlights. As we reached the midpoint of the year, our January forecast for a $3.1 billion to $3.4 billion SOC test market is playing out about as planned while our memory test market estimate has moved up to about $800 million to $850 million. In SOC, our sales grew 60% in the first half and 82% compared to 2Q of 2019 as our participation in this year's mobility tooling cycle is significantly stronger than in the last two years. As expected 5G infrastructure related capacity as remains weak after a strong 2019, while handset related silicon is driving the bulk of the demand. While 5G related silicon is beginning to add a small piece to the mobility handset market, the vast majority of the test demand is complexity growth in non-5G related handset silicon. Weather related to high resolution still or video photography, artificial intelligence, augmented reality, gaming, location sensing, or advanced wireless connectivity, there is a rich set of features in addition to 5G that we expect will continue to drive mobility demand for the foreseeable future. Specific to 5G, we are still in the early innings of a multi-year rollout and expect it to be an incremental demand driver going forward. Additionally, our new UltraFLEXplus platform will continue ramping in 3Q providing new revenue sources in mobility and computing going forward. Beyond mobility, the automotive and industrial segments of the SOC test market remain weak and we do not expect to see recovery until 2021. In memory, our 2Q sales were about flat with Q1, but up 45% from Q2 of 2019. Flash package tests and DRAM wafer tests combined with ramping shipments of LPDDR5 package testers drove Q2 results. DRAM test is growing faster than flash test in 2020 due to the LPDDR5 transition. And our design win in DRAM should allow us to hold our share position in the low 40s this year. In the system test group, sales were up 43% for the first half compared to 2019 due to strong storage test demand. We expect storage test shipments to grow sequentially and substantially in Q3 driven by both HDD demand and semiconductor at system level test shipments. System level test is a great example of derivative products opening new markets for Teradyne. By combining silicon test instruments with our HDD test product, we've grown the combined sales from $60 million in 2017 to over $200 million this year. At LitePoint, sales were up 32% for the first half and 19% compared with 2Q of 2019. Demand is being driven by WiFi 6 and growing shipments are 5G test sets. Wifi 6 has recently been allocated additional frequency spectrum in the 6 to 7 gigahertz range. Testing this expanded standard called Wifi 6E will require new testers, which we expect will be a positive force in 2021 and beyond. Moving to Industrial Automation, the environment is mixed, but improving. At UR, the biggest unit of our IA segment, sales in Q2 contracted 32% compared with the same period last year. Manufacturing shutdowns in Europe and North America had a significant impact on UR. MiR sales on the other hand grew 7% from last year\u2019s Q2 level as they benefited from exposure to healthcare and mobile disinfectant markets. AutoGuide, our newest IA business saw sales more than double from the same 2Q period last year. Overall, IA sales for the first half were down 15% from 2019. We have seen positive indications of improvement as we move through second quarter. For example, all three businesses had sequential monthly sales growth across Q2, as customers began to reopen. While we expect IA demand will improve in the third quarter, we don't expect to return to year-on-year growth until Q4 or Q1. Our longer term growth outlook for IA remains unchanged at 20% to 35%. Social distancing and the need for more resilient manufacturing flow should add additional drivers for our collaborative automation products. Our R&D and distribution investments in the IA business continue as these macro dividends slowdowns provide opportunities to widen our competitive lead. We continue to add distributors in the second quarter, expanded our UR plus stable of certified plug and play products to over 250 items. We also introduced UR plus applications moving to complete solutions for specific customer requirements like industrial bin-picking and welding. Stepping back to look at the full year at the company level, our latest estimates have revenue front half loaded at about 54% to 55%. This is similar to what we experienced in 2016 and 2017 when we saw especially strong investments for smartphone test capacity. In summary, the first half of the year showed Teradyne\u2019s strengths in familiar test markets and demonstrated our ability to grow in new ones with differentiated products and exemplary execution. Our business model is efficient and driving the planned drop through on incremental sales. Our investments to broaden our competitive moats in IA amidst a global industrial downturn showed the value of Teradyne\u2019s financial strength in these nascent industrial automation markets. While our short-term visibility remains limited, we are confident that our long-term strategy will continue to deliver outstanding results for our customers, employees, and investors. Now, I\u2019ll turn things over to Sanjay for additional color and the financial details.\nSanjay Mehta: Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. This morning, I\u2019ll review how the pandemic is impacting us from a financial supply line management perspective. I will then summarize our Q2 financial results and Q3 outlook. Our priorities remain consistent during the coronavirus pandemic, safety of our employees, supporting our customers and crisp execution to achieve our financial objectives. In line with my Q1 earnings call remarks, I wanted to acknowledge the continued challenges, our employees, customers, suppliers, and their families going through during this pandemic. From a financial point of view, Teradyne is stronger than ever. We generated $178 million of free cash flow in Q2 and ended the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion in cash and marketable securities and no short-term debt. During the quarter, we established a $400 million revolving line of credit for added security against future uncertainty and opportunities. The strength of our balance sheet, business model and business execution enabled us to put the revolver in place during a very uncertain time. Our long-term debt is a $460 million face value convert, which matures in December of 2023. From an operations perspective, our team and partners have done a great job so far this year. Over many years, Teradyne has built a global supply line management team second to none and the value of that team has never been more evident. COVID-related supply line issues did not have a material impact on our revenues in Q2. Our combined teams produce the highest number of UltraFLEX systems ever in the second quarter, ramped new products in SOC, memory and across our IA businesses all while operating in a very challenging environment. This included overcoming numerous part and labor shortages along with logistical constraints. In one case, the shortage of scheduled air cargo capacity led us to charter a dedicated 747 to deliver, quite literally, plane load of testers to a customer to ensure timely delivery. While operationally executing very well, we continue to take a critical view of how to strengthen our supply chain operations. We have identified potential weaknesses and are taking actions to strengthen our operations further. The short-term COVID-19 related actions along with these long-term actions have a small impact on margins. While the operations team clearly shined in the quarter, they were not alone. I\u2019d also like to extend thanks to the entire organization from HR to facilities and environmental health, to engineering, repair services, finance, legal, our global field and applications teams, which collectively allowed us to meet our delivery commitments at a revolver, introduce new products, maintain our R&D programs and run the company safely and productively with combination of at-home and on-site staffing. Well done. Very well done. Now on to the details of the quarter. Revenue in Q2 was $839 million, up 49% from Q2 of 2019, and up 46% for the first half of the year. Q2 revenue was 5% above the high end of the range driven by accelerated shipments in SOC test. Also while IA contracted year-over-year, IA revenue was higher than expected in Q2. Semi Test revenue was $659 million, up 76% from a year ago, driven by; one, SOC revenue was $575 million, up 82% from a year ago on broad strength and mobility. And two, memory revenue of $85 million, up 45% from a year ago, due to continued strength in flash test and ramp up of our Magnum Epic solution for DRAM. In System Test, revenues were $72 million, which included storage test shipments of $36 million, which were down sequentially, but up 6% from Q2 of 2019. Recall our storage test business tends to have lumpy shipments. First half storage test revenue was up 106% over the first half of 2019 on strengthen in both system level test and HDD product lines. Growth in SLT was driven primarily by processor demand while HDD shipments were driven by strong exabyte growth for hard drives. LitePoint revenue was $49 million in the quarter, up 19% from Q2 of 2019 on 5G WiFi 6 and next generation WiFi 6E demand. In industrial automation, revenue was $59 million, down 21% from Q2 of 2019 due to the coronavirus and down 3% from Q1 2020, but above our plan entering the quarter. UR contributed $43 million of revenue, near $11 million. AG and Energid made up the remainder. We believe in our IE segment revenue bottomed out in Q2, and is on the road to a sequential growth in Q3. We had one 10% customer in the quarter. As a reminder, we disclosed customers who contribute 10% or more of full year company revenue in our annual 10-K. Non-GAAP gross margins in the quarter were 56.2%, down 130 basis points from Q2 of 2019 as forecasted. Margins reflect the impact of concentrated mobility shipments in Semi Test and the added logistics and operations costs due to the pandemic. Non-GAAP operating expenses were up $11 million to $207 million from Q1 due to company performance causing higher variable compensation. Inventory increased to $206 million to support Q3 shipments and buffer against potential COVID-related supply disruptions. DSO in the quarter increased to 75 days due to the timing of shipments in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin was 31.5% and non-GAAP EPS was $1.33. Both are tracking ahead of our 2022 model. Tax rate in Q2 2020 was 13% on a GAAP basis and 14.1% on a non-GAAP basis. Our full year GAAP tax rate is expected to be 14%, down from our prior estimate of 14.5%. Our full year non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 14.5%, down from our prior estimate of 15%. The decrease in tax rate is due to product mix. We generated $178 million in free cash flow in Q2. We paid $17 million in dividends in the quarter. We bought back 173,000 shares for $9.4 million at an average price of $54.49 in the first few days of the quarter. As noted in April, we suspended our share repurchase program as of April 1. We look at our share repurchase and the entire capital allocation program regularly and we\u2019ll update you next quarter. Looking ahead at Q3, revenues will include a significant ramp in shipments of our new UltraFLEXplus SOC test system supporting recent design wins. In memory, we expect continued strong momentum for our Magnum product line for flash and DRAM applications. LPDDR5 test shipments are expected to grow significantly in Q3. In our system test group, storage test demand driven by system level tests and hard disk drive markets continue to see end market demand exceeding our expectations for the year. While this business fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter, Q3 is expected to more than double the Q2 level. I\u2019ll also note that while we expect multiple waves of 5G-related demand for both handsets and infrastructure in the years ahead, we are not planning on significant infrastructure test shipments in the second half, like we experienced in 2019. As a result, we expect to revert back to pre-2019 pattern of lower Q4 SOC shipments. In industrial automation, we are seeing incremental improvements in UR\u2019s business. As the U.S. and Europe start to open up, we are seeing signs of increased momentum in quarter-over-quarter. Recall the U.S. and Europe typically represent greater than 70% of UR\u2019s revenue. MiR continues to execute and in the first half of the year, grew by 4% year-over-year driven by ultraviolet light disinfectant demand. In Q3, we are guiding a revenue range of $745 million to $805 million and a non-GAAP EPS of $1.01 to $1.17 on 175 million of diluted shares. The ranges reflect continued coronavirus supply risks and potential impact on end market demand. The guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles and non-cash imputed interest on convertible debt. In April, we previewed expected gross margin headwinds in the second half of 2020 due to new product ramps. While the ramps continue as planned, our latest view is the impact will be less severe than earlier expected. Q3 gross margins will be 55% to 56%. We expect to be back to historical gross margin levels in 2021. In Q3, operating expenses are expected to be 26% to 28% of sales and are on track with our revised April full-year plan to grow 7% to 8% from 2019. The operating profit at the midpoint of our third quarter guidance is 29%. CapEx investments year-to-date are $84 million. And we expect full year investments with total approximately $175 million. We\u2019re investing more in CapEx this year to support new product rollouts, strengthening our supply chain and new facility projects. To summarize, we close out Q2 with outstanding financial and operational performance in a difficult working environment. We enter Q3 with a bright outlook on the strength of new product ramps and an industrial automation market that is showing signs of early improvement. While our visibility is limited and we\u2019re not immune to macroeconomic shocks. I\u2019m confident that we have the products, people and processes to thrive in the quarters ahead. With that, I\u2019ll turn things back to Andy.\nAndy Blanchard: Thanks, Sanjay. Vincent, we\u2019d now like to take some questions. And as a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini from SIG. Your line is now open. Please ask your question.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thank you for taking my question. Two questions. First, I want to better understand how to think about the earning power. I think it was two quarters ago that you highlighted a $3.5 to $4.25 earnings by 2022. And your recent execution suggests that you\u2019re already at that run rate. And my question to you is given the share gains in memory and other areas, do you think there is an upside to that earning scenario that you laid out six months ago or perhaps a $4 earning is sustainable and it shouldn\u2019t be viewed as a onetime event. And my follow up question has to do with China. How much of a revenue contribution did China provide? Thank you.\nSanjay Mehta: Hi, it\u2019s Sanjay here. Yes, I think this year; we\u2019ll come close or be in the range of hitting our earnings model out in 2022, and on the top line and the bottom line. And obviously there\u2019s many puts and takes relative to what we published in the earnings model, specifically strengthened Semi Test and storage business offsetting the near term impacts of COVID and the IA portfolio. What we\u2019ll plan on doing is in January updating that earnings model and provide guidance for the future then.\nMark Jagiela: And I think just, I\u2019ll add Mehdi that, as you know very well, we have a very volatile market that we play in. And so to sustain linear growth throughout a decade is not the kind of business we\u2019re in, but the trend lines we do believe support, certainly reaching and exceeding that mid-term earning model that in no way is going to be a peak for Teradyne.\nMehdi Hosseini: Great. Congrats. And then just quickly on China. What\u2019s the revenue contribution of China?\nMark Jagiela: So in the quarter, China was about 12.5% of revenue.\nMehdi Hosseini: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please ask your question.\nVivek Arya: Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on the strong results and the execution. Mark, you have bought up the test intensity factor a few times, but we honestly do not know how to put that in our model. When I look at your SOC test business, it\u2019s up, I think on track for over 30% growth, but overall phone volumes are down according to TSMC in mid teens, even though the 5G part has been relatively strong. So how do you quantify this test intensity factor per unit? Is it a 5G versus 4G comparison? And importantly, how will this test intensity factor evolve as you go into 2021? Will it be 5% better or 10% better? How do we size that because without knowing that it\u2019s very difficult to size what your SOC sales will do going forward?\nMark Jagiela: Yes, I appreciate the difficulty because if we had a formula, believe me, we would be using it and advertising it. But I do think what we\u2019ve said is when we look at the big, big picture, we see that the growth in transistors is what drives complexity. And that over an average trend line gives us test growth, market growth in that 6% to 8% range. Now, there\u2019s many puts and takes to go on every year. It depends if people are making a major transition from a note like a seven to five nanometer node that enables more transistors and typically has a lower yields that come with it. So it\u2019s very lumpy year-to-year and very hard to model year-to-year. But the net effects when you look back historically for the past five to seven years and at our projections are that sort of 6% to 8% trend line growth for test. So I don\u2019t think anything changing in that. But it\u2019s not going to be smooth. It\u2019s going to be lumpy. And the other thing is that affects this. If you look at this year, for example, the market for SOC test is really flat with last year. It\u2019s about a three \u2013 and we said $3.1 billion to $3.4 billion market and the underlying economic effects of what\u2019s going on in the world and cell phone unit declines and such as all and automotive being off and industrial being off is netting out to a flat market. Teradyne on the other hand is obviously picking up a lot of market share this year. That\u2019s both good news and bad news. I think the bad news is we\u2019d love to see the market grow every year, but in a very difficult macro year like this, the fact that it\u2019s holding its own, despite the weaknesses and the pockets I just mentioned is encouraging. And then we expect as we come out of this pandemic and the global economy start growing again, those markets will continue to grow along those trend lines. So I wish I had the formula, I don\u2019t, but I think the evidence is sort of speaking for itself.\nVivek Arya: Got it. And for my follow-up, Mark, when I look at again on the business as it relates to 5G, can you give us a sense for how much of your business is infrastructure versus handsets? And as part of that, let\u2019s say if 5G handsets triple next year right, what does that do to your SOC test business intensity being same or better? Does it mean your tester business will triple or how do we, give us some sense for how we kind of try and correlate your \u2013 the growth prospects to the number of 5G handsets and the demand for infrastructure? Thank you.\nMark Jagiela: Okay. So 5G is a piece of a phone. It\u2019s \u2013 the silicon-related to 5G in a phone is one part of a phone. So there\u2019s no way the tripling of 5G triples our tester business. But to give you some sense, the infrastructure piece of 5G was very robust last year, and we talked about it all year long, and you saw that our business level grew toward the back end of the year due to infrastructure investments. And then we talked about the fact that those investments would taper off in 2020, which they have, and what would come into the market would be handset related growth. But we\u2019re still talking about, and we\u2019ve also said 5G in aggregate should add to our test business somewhere between $400 million to $500 million of market. And if Teradyne is at 50% of the market that should add, let\u2019s say $250-ish million to Teradyne\u2019s business, and when it\u2019s peaking, but we\u2019re not peaking. We\u2019re not near peaking. This year, we\u2019re \u2013 maybe a couple hundred million dollars into that $500 million envelope. So that will give you the sort of calibration on how much you might think 5G could mean to us over the next four to five years on an annual basis. When we get to that mature $500 million level, hopefully we\u2019re running at that $250 million plus or minus additional revenue level.\nVivek Arya: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Brian Chin from Stifel. Your line is now open. Please ask your question.\nBrian Chin: Hi, Mark and Sanjay, great results, and thanks for letting us ask a few questions. First, as was just discussed in the last question there, but the company \u2013 and clearly company and industry-specific factors contributing to your 50%, 60% year-over-year, year-to-date growth rate in Semi Tests. However, do you think a layer of this growth could reflect your customers or customers\u2019 customers attempt to put some inventory in place, be it wafer, chip or even end device, the safeguard against future supply chain and demand uncertainties? I would appreciate any thoughts.\nSanjay Mehta: Yes. Hi, it\u2019s Sanjay. So, we do a lot of work and trying to triangulate our shipments and then trying to understand utilization and inventory levels of testers out there. And I think what you saw in 2019 as Mark articulated earlier was a buildup of infrastructure test tooling and which kind of built the capacity. So they could have a run rate. From an end market and inventory perspective, we\u2019re not seeing test or inventory build. We\u2019re always on the lookout for it and concerned about it. But from the analysis we\u2019ve done, we actually don\u2019t see that inventory buildup.\nBrian Chin: Okay, great. And you\u2019re talking more about the equipment versus further downstream in terms of that activity.\nSanjay Mehta: Yes. Mainly from the tester equipment, it\u2019s very hard from an end market perspective, be it smartphone or industrial or automotive to think about those inventories.\nBrian Chin: Sure. Okay. Yes. I was kind of geared at more further downstream, but I appreciate the commentary. Maybe one last one, I know, you are not guiding fourth quarter per se here, but based on your 54% \u2013 I think the 55% first half weighted revenue comment, does that roughly suggest 4Q sales would be down something like 30%, 35% sequential. And would you expect Semi Test sales decline as similar or higher, lower rate?\nSanjay Mehta: Yes, we\u2019re effectively guiding down 35% to 40% versus Q3 mid.\nMark Jagiela: Yes, I think what we\u2019re \u2013 when you do the math, it is exactly what you just did. And now the decomposition of the various businesses in that, there\u2019s a lot still in flux. So IA tends to be up in the fourth quarter and we expect that will continue. So I think last year with atypical with the strong semiconductors. So I think if you looked at prior years, you get essentially the same kind of mix.\nBrian Chin: Okay, great. Great. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Please ask your question.\nJohn Pitzer: Yes, good morning guys. Congratulations on the solid results. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Mark, you said in your kind of prepared comments that as the next wave of Huawei bands come into effect, you don\u2019t see much of an impact to global test capacity as other suppliers fill the void. I\u2019m just kind of curious, and I know it\u2019s a little bit of a guessing game, but when you look at the potential suppliers to fill that void, how does your share with those suppliers look vis-\u00e0-vis Huawei? And I guess importantly, do you think the test capacity that\u2019s out there just gets repurposed for these different suppliers? Or do you think it might actually cause some incremental buying?\nMark Jagiela: Well, I think over the long haul, meaning let\u2019s say a year. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s going to be \u2013 I think there\u2019ll be repurposed and there could be incremental buy in early on. We\u2019re in a period right now where the testers are still very full up being used through this September 15 date until we get past the sort of grace period and into the embargo. So post that period of time, there could be some spot buying because they\u2019re not completely fungible. But over time, they\u2019ll work their way into the supply and demand balance. So there\u2019s no long-term consequence here that we see. And our share position in the alternative sources of supply, it\u2019s some are better, some are a little lower, but I think when we\u2019ve analyzed it overall, I think, we\u2019re neutral. We don\u2019t see that we\u2019re going to be overly benefited or a detriment because of the shift in who\u2019s going to make the silicon for those products.\nJohn Pitzer: And then Mark, just going back to the implied guidance for the calendar fourth quarter, that kind of implied sequential decline is not without precedence in your business model. And if I go back to like the 2012, 2013, 2014 period, you saw that kind of fall off in Q4, but I\u2019m just kind of curious, given how uncertain the environment is today, is that your attempt at a conservative placeholder, or do you actually have visibility out to the December quarter that informs kind of that view of 55%, 45% half-on-half split?\nMark Jagiela: Yes. What I would say is that, if even more recently you looked at 2016 and 2017. One of the differences we were seeing right now is that those were also heavy tooling years for smartphones for us. We saw pretty significant drops from Q2 to Q3 in those years, maybe on the order of 20% to 25% followed by another 5% to 7% in Q4. So this year instead of the 2Q to 3Q drop, we\u2019re kind of seeing it all coming Q4 is our forecast. Our visibility is actually quite limited out there.  We \u2013 obviously, when you look at what we\u2019ve been doing this year, and if you followed us a long time, there\u2019s quite a bit of variability in the out quarter in terms of what might materialize. So we don\u2019t have a lot of backlog that extends out that far and what will actually happen. There\u2019s quite a wide range around it, but it\u2019s based on the modeling we can do, the customer conversations we\u2019re having and those kinds of things.\nJohn Pitzer: Helpful guys. Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line from Atif Malik from Citi. Your line is now open. Please ask your question.\nAtif Malik: Yes. Thank you for taking my questions and good job in the results and guide. Mark, can you talk about the timing of the Millimeter Wave opportunity when you expect the infrastructure part of the investments to evolve and also on the mobility side?\nMark Jagiela: Millimeter Wave, frankly, I think is quite a ways off from being a big part of the infrastructure and then subsequently handset story. It\u2019s a big test intensive event when it occurs, but it\u2019s likely, none of the geographies are moving aggressively with Millimeter Wave. In the U.S., there\u2019s some boutique deployments, I would say, in urban areas and some high-density areas. But it appears most of the U.S. carriers are going to do is rollout sub 6G in some flavor first and then slowly move toward Millimeter Wave. So our view is, there certainly will be handsets at the premium tier that have that capability to run on those scarce networks and there\u2019ll be some bump, and we\u2019ve seen it already this year. Our Millimeter Wave shipments of test equipment at both LitePoint and Semi Test are tens and tens of millions of dollars. So it\u2019s not insignificant even if the miniscule volumes we\u2019re talking about. But it\u2019s probably not until 2022, 2023 before it starts to matter would be my estimate.\nAtif Malik: Great. And then you talked about design wins in computing, which is a relatively new area for you guys with UltraFLEXplus. We also heard that one of your customers\u2019 customers moving to ARM-based CPUs for their notebooks. And those CPUs have much larger die size than the apps processor using smartphone. So how do you look at your computing share gain opportunity over the next 12 months to 18 months?\nSanjay Mehta: Yes. Hi, it\u2019s Sanjay here. So the compute market is roughly annually $500 million to $600 million. And our share has been roughly 30% give or take historically. Our new UltraFLEXplus product will help us grow that share. And this initial design win will help along that journey. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it in the near term.\nAtif Malik: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please ask your question.\nToshiya Hari: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the strong results. Mark, I wanted to ask about your System Test business both on the HDD side as well as the SLT side. In terms of your HDD business, you\u2019ve been speaking to this business and the strength there for a couple of quarters now, how are you thinking about sustainability of that strength into, I guess Q4, since you\u2019re guiding up Q3? And on the SLT side, your nearest competitor here, I guess that they\u2019ve been pretty vocal about this specific application as well over the past couple of quarters. How are you sizing the opportunity in SLT? And how should we think about your competitive position relative to not just Advantest, but also some of the other players that play here? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nMark Jagiela: The whole storage test business, whether it\u2019s HDD or SLT, has been a tremendous story, and it\u2019s surprised us. And it seems as though the sustainability of it is pretty robust. It doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not volatile even in this year. You can see the quarter-to-quarter we can swing on shipments, 20%, 30% a quarter. So it\u2019s quarter-to-quarter volatile, but the overall underlying demand is very strong for both HDD and SLT. The SLT side of it, as we\u2019ve described before, it\u2019s still somewhat of a nascent market. This is an additional test step that some high volume \u2013 manufacturers of some high volume digital centric devices are using to further reduce defects per million. And the economics of this insertion are something that both customers and equipment suppliers like ourselves and others are working to try to make more attractive for other classes of devices, lower volume devices, more mixed signal with RF and analog content and such. So how the rate of adoption of SLT is just a big unknown in this, but even with the limited adoption that exists today, you can see that from last year when the early adoption occurred outside of compute, which has been doing this for quite some time, it's grown to be pretty significant. It might be a $300 million tester market, something like that this year. And we're probably splitting it roughly 50:50 or so with Advantest tests and just sort of the test area. So I do think it's got legs. I do think that the underlying complexity issues, we're talking about compel these additional test steps in the very high end of complex devices. And so, it's going to be a growth industry. It's going to be volatile though. And until we get a dozen customers adopting this wildly, you're likely to see these quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year fluctuations that we've seen up till now.\nToshiya Hari: Thanks for that. And then as my follow-up, I wanted to ask about the industrial automation business and how you're thinking about the long-term growth profile there. I think in your prepared remarks, you reiterated your long-term growth target, but curious just given COVID-19 and the potential impact it could have on how your customers and customer\u2019s customers think about their factory footprint, I guess. Could this drive a significant increase in adoption rates of things like UR cobots and MiR robots? Or is it a little early to make that call? Thank you.\nSanjay Mehta: Yes. Hi, Sanjay here. So I think over since 2015, we've experienced significant growth in UR than adding MiR in 2018 and then as well as AutoGuide in 2019. And that growth we expected to continue in 2020. Obviously, COVID hit, and we're looking at potentially a contraction year depending on how the market shakes out in the second half. However, our belief is that we're going to continue over the long run to grow at the 20% to 35% as Mark stated in his prepared remarks. And really I think that you consider over the short-term, I think there's going to need to be a balance of getting people back to work versus industrial automation. However, in the business development activities, we're seeing a lot of activity in this plant managers and decision makers looking to harden their production lines and social distance. So, we are seeing activity even in the short-term. I think in the long-term, it will provide a tailwind. However, we're still in the mid-term around the 20% to 35% growth, and we still continue to invest in product differentiation and application differentiation in those businesses.\nToshiya Hari: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore. Your line is now open. Please ask your question.\nC.J. Muse: Yes, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, first question in your prepared remarks, I just want to double check here. I think I heard you say that system test would double from $72 million in Q2 into Q3. Is that correct? And as part of that, can you give us an idea of where we should be thinking about the growth balancing storage versus a traditional system test?\nMark Jagiela: Yes, you're right. I did say that we would double and more than double in Q3, but it was off of baseline of $36 million in storage.\nSanjay Mehta: In storage.\nMark Jagiela: Yes, in storage.\nC.J. Muse: So that was just the storage comment, not overall system test.\nMark Jagiela: Correct.\nC.J. Muse: Okay. Great. And then I guess as my follow up question thinking through the SOC market, it looks like your share is probably going from 40% to low 50s year-on-year. And I guess was hoping for you to parse through the drivers there. Obviously, mix plays a role. And you do have your largest customer turning on. They're also bringing on arm-based processors, I believe, embedded AI that that really helps you guys. You have new UltraFLEXplus. And then, you talked 5G being only a minimal driver. So, amidst that backdrop, what are the key drivers of that share shift? And more importantly, how should we think about the sustainability of that share looking into 2021?\nMark Jagiela: So you're right. We think probably our share in SOC moves up around 50% this year and much of it \u2013 the majority of it is due to the shift of who's buying. So in the last couple of years, our share kind of came down. It wasn't customers defecting. It was who was buying. And this year, the biggest piece of the 10 point or so share gain in SOC will be opposite effect of our customers are buying more. However, there's also this component. We've talked about the UltraFLEXplus and the designs wins we've had in mobility and compute. Those are going to in the back half of the year add additional new revenue streams for us. And so, we are picking up real customers to on this. So that's not insignificant and that won't completely mature in 2020. It's going to be more of the beginning. And so that will grow throughout 2021 and 2022. So we do have a lot of headroom to continue to move our share north of 50% based on those design wins other ones in the pipeline. But as you know the underlying sort of core buying will fluctuate year-to-year. So if you go back to 2016 and 2017, we had some very big years of tooling for our customers around smartphone silicon. 2018 and 2019 was a bit down. We picked up new business in infrastructure to sort of offset part of that. Now, we come back, it's gangbusters. And that could persist for a while, but it's going to still be volatile, I'm sure. But riding on top of that is this little new wedge of new revenue streams in SOC based on real design wins. That gives us that ability to keep on average moving our share north. And we've talked about long-term getting to 60% share of this market is reasonable. Once you're past 60%, there'll be a little bit more difficult perhaps, but 60% is certainly within a line of sight.\nC.J. Muse: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. Your line is now open. Please ask your question.\nTimothy Arcuri: Hi, thanks. First of all, I wanted to get what the 5G portion of the SOC TAM of this year. Let's say you're saying $3.1 million to $3.4 million, I'm just wondering how much of that's 5G and then I had another one. Thanks.\nMark Jagiela: Yes. We struggled to estimate that one precisely, but again, what I \u2013 I'll just give you the context and give you my best guess of the numbers. So we said that at peak, 5G should represent about $400 million adder to SOC tests and about $100 million adder to LitePoint test. So of that SOC $400 million max envelope, this year 5G is probably somewhere in the $200-ish million range for TAM.\nTimothy Arcuri: Got it. And for wireless, Mark, there's \u2013 I mean, how much of the wireless piece is coming in the current year?\nMark Jagiela: Yes, in wireless, the 100 \u2013 and we've actually seen that wireless may grow to be a bit bigger than $100 million adder. It could be a $150 million adder or so. But this year, the wireless is probably in that \u2013this is production test, not R&D test, but it's probably in that $70 million \u2013 $60 million to $70 million range for the market.\nTimothy Arcuri: Got it. Okay, awesome. And then I just wanted to follow up on the last question. So I mean, there's a lot of stuff going on beyond your big customer. And certainly, you have the UltraFLEXplus ramping. But usually, I mean, a significant portion will say of your share gain this year, you're going to gain 13, 14 points a share is because your big customers having an on year. And usually, they don't have 2 straight on years. So I'm just sort of wondering if you strip away all the other stuff going on and you look at how sustainable that low 50 shares into next year, why would it be different this time where they would have 2 straight big on years versus history where they've had one on year and then they've had an off year? Thanks.\nMark Jagiela: Well, I think history is interesting in this. If you look at 2016 and 2017, actually our smartphone related business was pretty flat and consistent and hot. Those were peak years in the past, and it was 2 successive year. So I think the on/off, on/off pattern goes back to the earlier part of the decade, but I think 2016 and 2017 are equally valid thoughts and models around that. So that's one thought. It doesn't necessarily mean up and down, but at some point it's not going to be what's norm in baseline I think is a judgment, but I'd go back to that sort of trend line of the market. We expect to grow 6% to 7%. So if the SOC market this year is again, let's say, $3.3 billion, nominally, we're talking about a market that should be $3.4 billion, $3.5 billion, everything else being equal next year. So I do think we can have two sequential strong years because we've had them in the past, and there's nothing wrong with that. Plus we have these new design wins coming online that haven't matured yet. And then the thing we haven't talked about that's out there is memory. Memory is having a pretty strong year this year. And if you look into 2021, the 2021 era is going to see this large shift from DDR4 to DDR5. This year, we're at the very early innings of the LPDDR5 shift for more mobile devices, but the DDR5 shift is coming. And as we said, that obsoletes the installed base of DRAM test equipment for final test. So there's a big retooling coming there as well.\nTimothy Arcuri: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. Please ask your question.\nKrish Sankar: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I had two of them. First one, Mark, to just follow up on your comments from the previous question. You said a couple of sequential growth years. It looks like you had like from a SOC test market standpoint, you had like five years of continuous growth. So I'm kind of curious, understand the test intensity is going up and 5G seems to be a longer and a stronger cycle. So if going forward, should a $3 plus billion be a decent bogey to use for the SOC market size? And I have a follow up.\nMark Jagiela: Go a bogey, I think is \u2013 so let me just add a few more comments about where we are. So you're right. We've seen the market show sequential annual growth for quite some length of time here. This year, it's maybe going to be about flat, but it may show a 4%, 5% growth as well by the time the year is over. And that's absent any real interesting participation of automotive and industrial buying. This is heavy, heavy mobility. And it's also in the midst of a pandemic. And it's also in the midst of all the regulations coming in around China. So I'll go back and say, I would model in a 6% to 8% TAM growth rate for SOC over the mid-term, four to five years. That is what we should be tracking at.\nKrish Sankar: Got it, got it. That's helpful. And then as a follow-up, Mark, can you just tell us how much of your revenue was from LPDDR5? And when I look at your memory market size, you\u2019re talking about $800 million to $850 million, six months ago it is more like $650 million to $750 million. Clearly, the upside is coming from DRAM. And so, I'm just trying to figure out on the market size how much of the upside is coming from the LPDDR5? And within that, how much of your revenue is coming from LPDDR5?\nMark Jagiela: Yes, I'm not going to break out our LPDDR5 revenue, but I will say that the increase in the market size is both flash and DRAM. It's about two thirds DRAM and one third flash compared to our estimate in January. So we are seeing upside on flash too. And much of the upside in DRAM is related to LPDDR5. So you would expect \u2013 and because our share is kind of going to be flat, you can derive a close estimate of maybe how much revenue is coming out of that for us this year. And we're working on design wins to hopefully capture more of the DRAM market. We just introduced that product in Q4 of last year and we're ramping it this year. So that's what gives us upside going into next year, we think around DDR5, and we talked in earlier calls about our sort of 40% to 45% market share that we have should \u2013 with the products we have today and the competitive position we have today, we should be able to move that into the 50% \u2013 low 50% range here in the next couple of years, if we really execute well. So that's what we're focused on in planning.\nKrish Sankar: Thanks for that, Mark. Very helpful.\nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman from Baird. Your line is now open. Please ask your question.\nRichard Eastman: Oh, yes. Good morning. Good morning Mark and Sanjay. Very nice, very nice quarter to be sure. Just a couple of questions. I'm just going to kind of focus for a second or two on the IA business. Could you talk about how the business progressed? You talked perhaps a little bit about some upside in the quarter here relative to your expectations, but could you talk maybe geographically what you're seeing in IA around universal robots and maybe just discuss any successes you might have. You talked about some self-help initiatives around distribution and around some new product applications coming to market. So maybe just provide a little bit of color on there because it seems like that business has at least stabilized, if not maybe getting back towards growth mode.\nSanjay Mehta: Hi. It's Sanjay here. So I'll talk a little bit about kind of the GO and kind of monthly profile. So for UR, when I take a look at China, first to go into COVID and first to kind of come out, and when we take a look at kind of the monthly profile, we saw improvement in March and then sequentially we saw improvement throughout the quarter and really kind of coming back strong. And when we take a look at not back to last year's levels, but improving Q2 over Q1 and based on the forecast we see that improvement continuing. But when we take that recipe of opening up and we look at the data and look at the U.S. and Europe, which is over 70% of the historical UR business, we're very encouraged. And so, we are seeing business development activities. We are seeing growth coming, but really the baseline is China and the business activity in the U.S. as well as Europe. And from a product perspective from the applications, we're continuing to invest. We've recently have launched in April our ActiNav for bin picking. And we continue to drive for ease of implementation activities and really growing the ecosystem.\nRichard Eastman: And at that \u2013 just as a follow-up, at that $59 million revenue for IA in the quarter, how did you manage \u2013 again, if I do the math quickly and your gross margin is still hanging out in the high 50s, maybe to 60%, how did you manage the OpEX in the quarter for IA? And was that \u2013 how far from profitability were we in the quarter\u2026\nSanjay Mehta: Yes, so I think I mentioned earlier in 2019, we were profitable and our full year plan in 2020 pre-COVID was a heavy investment year in IA, both on the engineering side as well as the go-to market side. And we still plan in IA to be profitable at similar levels in 2020. COVID hits and then you \u2013 we\u2019re faced with a situation of not having the revenue growth. So we meet or down a lot of the go-to-market spends and that was a significant reduction. However, we continued forward with the engineering and application spend significantly. So, what you're seeing in the immediate short-term aside from kind of the re-vectoring that we did in metering down kind of the selling and marketing or go-to market spending is you're seeing more and more online marketing, more and more virtual trade shows, et cetera, and kind of restricted travel, obviously. So, you're seeing a short-term reduction in selling and marketing spend. However, you are seeing a little bit of travel and those types of costs within the engineering ranks, but we're continuing to significantly invest on that front.\nRichard Eastman: As far as that\u2019s close to profitability\u2026\nSanjay Mehta: We are \u2013 I don't believe in 2020, we will \u2013 it's very uncertain depending on the revenue levels in the back half of the year.\nMark Jagiela: Okay.\nSanjay Mehta: But we're teetering on. It just really depends on the top line, but we are \u2013 I want to reiterate that we are encouraged by the activity of Q3 and \u2013 as well as the ramp up in China for UR in Q2 and we expect that to continue.\nRichard Eastman: Thank you.\nA - Mark Jagiela: Okay. And operator, we are out of time. So those in the queue, I will get back to you at the conclusion of this call and thanks everyone for joining us today. And we look forward to talking to you in the days and weeks ahead. Bye-bye.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",

            "name": "Mark Jagiela",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone. Today I'll summarize our results for the second quarter and the first half of 2020, comment on the impact of current environmental conditions, including new trade regulations and then describe our view of the second half of the year. Sanjay will then provide the financial details on the quarter and our guidance for Q3. Despite the pandemic trade issues and shutdown related headwinds and industrial automation, Teradyne is performing exceptionally well. In the second quarter \u2013 our second quarter results affirmed the trend of growing test intensity and the efficiency of our business model. As you can see from our Q3 guidance, the market demand remains robust. While Q2 saw record SOC shipments, 3Q is being driven by growth in memory test and system level test. Industrial automation continues to pull out of the effects of global industrial shutdowns as we saw sequential monthly growth in sales throughout second quarter. We expect second quarter to be the bottom for IA and 3Q sales to be back close to 2019 levels. Superb execution by the global Teradyne team was on full display in second quarter as we managed to deliver new shipment records and test. Supply line constraints were largely mitigated and remote technical collaboration with both within Teradyne and with our customers continues to show success. It takes dozens to hundreds of engineers working in concert to develop new test products. It takes similar numbers working with customers to launch test programs for new silicon. Flipping a switch to do this remotely without missing a beat is a fantastic accomplishment. And I congratulate and thank all the employees of Teradyne for this achievement. On the trade front, new regulations related to both Huawei and China military end users were announced in the second quarter. We expect the China military end-user restrictions to increase our compliance work and costs, but we currently do not expect any material impact on our sales into China. In the case of Huawei, while the new regulations do not impose any new restrictions on our business with Huawei directly, we expect it will likely impact our business with sub-com customers who test Huawei devices using our test equipment. However, we expect the macro global test demand to be minimally impacted as alternative sources of silicon supply grow to fill in whatever gap is created by these regulations. This alternative supplies should absorb any idled test capacity as well as drive new demand in the future. Shifting to the highlights. As we reached the midpoint of the year, our January forecast for a $3.1 billion to $3.4 billion SOC test market is playing out about as planned while our memory test market estimate has moved up to about $800 million to $850 million. In SOC, our sales grew 60% in the first half and 82% compared to 2Q of 2019 as our participation in this year's mobility tooling cycle is significantly stronger than in the last two years. As expected 5G infrastructure related capacity as remains weak after a strong 2019, while handset related silicon is driving the bulk of the demand. While 5G related silicon is beginning to add a small piece to the mobility handset market, the vast majority of the test demand is complexity growth in non-5G related handset silicon. Weather related to high resolution still or video photography, artificial intelligence, augmented reality, gaming, location sensing, or advanced wireless connectivity, there is a rich set of features in addition to 5G that we expect will continue to drive mobility demand for the foreseeable future. Specific to 5G, we are still in the early innings of a multi-year rollout and expect it to be an incremental demand driver going forward. Additionally, our new UltraFLEXplus platform will continue ramping in 3Q providing new revenue sources in mobility and computing going forward. Beyond mobility, the automotive and industrial segments of the SOC test market remain weak and we do not expect to see recovery until 2021. In memory, our 2Q sales were about flat with Q1, but up 45% from Q2 of 2019. Flash package tests and DRAM wafer tests combined with ramping shipments of LPDDR5 package testers drove Q2 results. DRAM test is growing faster than flash test in 2020 due to the LPDDR5 transition. And our design win in DRAM should allow us to hold our share position in the low 40s this year. In the system test group, sales were up 43% for the first half compared to 2019 due to strong storage test demand. We expect storage test shipments to grow sequentially and substantially in Q3 driven by both HDD demand and semiconductor at system level test shipments. System level test is a great example of derivative products opening new markets for Teradyne. By combining silicon test instruments with our HDD test product, we've grown the combined sales from $60 million in 2017 to over $200 million this year. At LitePoint, sales were up 32% for the first half and 19% compared with 2Q of 2019. Demand is being driven by WiFi 6 and growing shipments are 5G test sets. Wifi 6 has recently been allocated additional frequency spectrum in the 6 to 7 gigahertz range. Testing this expanded standard called Wifi 6E will require new testers, which we expect will be a positive force in 2021 and beyond. Moving to Industrial Automation, the environment is mixed, but improving. At UR, the biggest unit of our IA segment, sales in Q2 contracted 32% compared with the same period last year. Manufacturing shutdowns in Europe and North America had a significant impact on UR. MiR sales on the other hand grew 7% from last year's Q2 level as they benefited from exposure to healthcare and mobile disinfectant markets. AutoGuide, our newest IA business saw sales more than double from the same 2Q period last year. Overall, IA sales for the first half were down 15% from 2019. We have seen positive indications of improvement as we move through second quarter. For example, all three businesses had sequential monthly sales growth across Q2, as customers began to reopen. While we expect IA demand will improve in the third quarter, we don't expect to return to year-on-year growth until Q4 or Q1. Our longer term growth outlook for IA remains unchanged at 20% to 35%. Social distancing and the need for more resilient manufacturing flow should add additional drivers for our collaborative automation products. Our R&D and distribution investments in the IA business continue as these macro dividends slowdowns provide opportunities to widen our competitive lead. We continue to add distributors in the second quarter, expanded our UR plus stable of certified plug and play products to over 250 items. We also introduced UR plus applications moving to complete solutions for specific customer requirements like industrial bin-picking and welding. Stepping back to look at the full year at the company level, our latest estimates have revenue front half loaded at about 54% to 55%. This is similar to what we experienced in 2016 and 2017 when we saw especially strong investments for smartphone test capacity. In summary, the first half of the year showed Teradyne's strengths in familiar test markets and demonstrated our ability to grow in new ones with differentiated products and exemplary execution. Our business model is efficient and driving the planned drop through on incremental sales. Our investments to broaden our competitive moats in IA amidst a global industrial downturn showed the value of Teradyne's financial strength in these nascent industrial automation markets. While our short-term visibility remains limited, we are confident that our long-term strategy will continue to deliver outstanding results for our customers, employees, and investors. Now, I'll turn things over to Sanjay for additional color and the financial details. And I think just, I'll add Mehdi that, as you know very well, we have a very volatile market that we play in. And so to sustain linear growth throughout a decade is not the kind of business we're in, but the trend lines we do believe support, certainly reaching and exceeding that mid-term earning model that in no way is going to be a peak for Teradyne. So in the quarter, China was about 12.5% of revenue. Yes, I appreciate the difficulty because if we had a formula, believe me, we would be using it and advertising it. But I do think what we've said is when we look at the big, big picture, we see that the growth in transistors is what drives complexity. And that over an average trend line gives us test growth, market growth in that 6% to 8% range. Now, there's many puts and takes to go on every year. It depends if people are making a major transition from a note like a seven to five nanometer node that enables more transistors and typically has a lower yields that come with it. So it's very lumpy year-to-year and very hard to model year-to-year. But the net effects when you look back historically for the past five to seven years and at our projections are that sort of 6% to 8% trend line growth for test. So I don't think anything changing in that. But it's not going to be smooth. It's going to be lumpy. And the other thing is that affects this. If you look at this year, for example, the market for SOC test is really flat with last year. It's about a three \u2013 and we said $3.1 billion to $3.4 billion market and the underlying economic effects of what's going on in the world and cell phone unit declines and such as all and automotive being off and industrial being off is netting out to a flat market. Teradyne on the other hand is obviously picking up a lot of market share this year. That's both good news and bad news. I think the bad news is we'd love to see the market grow every year, but in a very difficult macro year like this, the fact that it's holding its own, despite the weaknesses and the pockets I just mentioned is encouraging. And then we expect as we come out of this pandemic and the global economy start growing again, those markets will continue to grow along those trend lines. So I wish I had the formula, I don't, but I think the evidence is sort of speaking for itself. Okay. So 5G is a piece of a phone. It's \u2013 the silicon-related to 5G in a phone is one part of a phone. So there's no way the tripling of 5G triples our tester business. But to give you some sense, the infrastructure piece of 5G was very robust last year, and we talked about it all year long, and you saw that our business level grew toward the back end of the year due to infrastructure investments. And then we talked about the fact that those investments would taper off in 2020, which they have, and what would come into the market would be handset related growth. But we're still talking about, and we've also said 5G in aggregate should add to our test business somewhere between $400 million to $500 million of market. And if Teradyne is at 50% of the market that should add, let's say $250-ish million to Teradyne's business, and when it's peaking, but we're not peaking. We're not near peaking. This year, we're \u2013 maybe a couple hundred million dollars into that $500 million envelope. So that will give you the sort of calibration on how much you might think 5G could mean to us over the next four to five years on an annual basis. When we get to that mature $500 million level, hopefully we're running at that $250 million plus or minus additional revenue level. Yes, I think what we're \u2013 when you do the math, it is exactly what you just did. And now the decomposition of the various businesses in that, there's a lot still in flux. So IA tends to be up in the fourth quarter and we expect that will continue. So I think last year with atypical with the strong semiconductors. So I think if you looked at prior years, you get essentially the same kind of mix. Well, I think over the long haul, meaning let's say a year. I don't think there's going to be \u2013 I think there'll be repurposed and there could be incremental buy in early on. We're in a period right now where the testers are still very full up being used through this September 15 date until we get past the sort of grace period and into the embargo. So post that period of time, there could be some spot buying because they're not completely fungible. But over time, they'll work their way into the supply and demand balance. So there's no long-term consequence here that we see. And our share position in the alternative sources of supply, it's some are better, some are a little lower, but I think when we've analyzed it overall, I think, we're neutral. We don't see that we're going to be overly benefited or a detriment because of the shift in who's going to make the silicon for those products. Yes. What I would say is that, if even more recently you looked at 2016 and 2017. One of the differences we were seeing right now is that those were also heavy tooling years for smartphones for us. We saw pretty significant drops from Q2 to Q3 in those years, maybe on the order of 20% to 25% followed by another 5% to 7% in Q4. So this year instead of the 2Q to 3Q drop, we're kind of seeing it all coming Q4 is our forecast. Our visibility is actually quite limited out there.  We \u2013 obviously, when you look at what we've been doing this year, and if you followed us a long time, there's quite a bit of variability in the out quarter in terms of what might materialize. So we don't have a lot of backlog that extends out that far and what will actually happen. There's quite a wide range around it, but it's based on the modeling we can do, the customer conversations we're having and those kinds of things. Millimeter Wave, frankly, I think is quite a ways off from being a big part of the infrastructure and then subsequently handset story. It's a big test intensive event when it occurs, but it's likely, none of the geographies are moving aggressively with Millimeter Wave. In the U.S., there's some boutique deployments, I would say, in urban areas and some high-density areas. But it appears most of the U.S. carriers are going to do is rollout sub 6G in some flavor first and then slowly move toward Millimeter Wave. So our view is, there certainly will be handsets at the premium tier that have that capability to run on those scarce networks and there'll be some bump, and we've seen it already this year. Our Millimeter Wave shipments of test equipment at both LitePoint and Semi Test are tens and tens of millions of dollars. So it's not insignificant even if the miniscule volumes we're talking about. But it's probably not until 2022, 2023 before it starts to matter would be my estimate. The whole storage test business, whether it's HDD or SLT, has been a tremendous story, and it's surprised us. And it seems as though the sustainability of it is pretty robust. It doesn't mean it's not volatile even in this year. You can see the quarter-to-quarter we can swing on shipments, 20%, 30% a quarter. So it's quarter-to-quarter volatile, but the overall underlying demand is very strong for both HDD and SLT. The SLT side of it, as we've described before, it's still somewhat of a nascent market. This is an additional test step that some high volume \u2013 manufacturers of some high volume digital centric devices are using to further reduce defects per million. And the economics of this insertion are something that both customers and equipment suppliers like ourselves and others are working to try to make more attractive for other classes of devices, lower volume devices, more mixed signal with RF and analog content and such. So how the rate of adoption of SLT is just a big unknown in this, but even with the limited adoption that exists today, you can see that from last year when the early adoption occurred outside of compute, which has been doing this for quite some time, it's grown to be pretty significant. It might be a $300 million tester market, something like that this year. And we're probably splitting it roughly 50:50 or so with Advantest tests and just sort of the test area. So I do think it's got legs. I do think that the underlying complexity issues, we're talking about compel these additional test steps in the very high end of complex devices. And so, it's going to be a growth industry. It's going to be volatile though. And until we get a dozen customers adopting this wildly, you're likely to see these quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year fluctuations that we've seen up till now. Yes, you're right. I did say that we would double and more than double in Q3, but it was off of baseline of $36 million in storage. Yes, in storage. Correct. So you're right. We think probably our share in SOC moves up around 50% this year and much of it \u2013 the majority of it is due to the shift of who's buying. So in the last couple of years, our share kind of came down. It wasn't customers defecting. It was who was buying. And this year, the biggest piece of the 10 point or so share gain in SOC will be opposite effect of our customers are buying more. However, there's also this component. We've talked about the UltraFLEXplus and the designs wins we've had in mobility and compute. Those are going to in the back half of the year add additional new revenue streams for us. And so, we are picking up real customers to on this. So that's not insignificant and that won't completely mature in 2020. It's going to be more of the beginning. And so that will grow throughout 2021 and 2022. So we do have a lot of headroom to continue to move our share north of 50% based on those design wins other ones in the pipeline. But as you know the underlying sort of core buying will fluctuate year-to-year. So if you go back to 2016 and 2017, we had some very big years of tooling for our customers around smartphone silicon. 2018 and 2019 was a bit down. We picked up new business in infrastructure to sort of offset part of that. Now, we come back, it's gangbusters. And that could persist for a while, but it's going to still be volatile, I'm sure. But riding on top of that is this little new wedge of new revenue streams in SOC based on real design wins. That gives us that ability to keep on average moving our share north. And we've talked about long-term getting to 60% share of this market is reasonable. Once you're past 60%, there'll be a little bit more difficult perhaps, but 60% is certainly within a line of sight. Yes. We struggled to estimate that one precisely, but again, what I \u2013 I'll just give you the context and give you my best guess of the numbers. So we said that at peak, 5G should represent about $400 million adder to SOC tests and about $100 million adder to LitePoint test. So of that SOC $400 million max envelope, this year 5G is probably somewhere in the $200-ish million range for TAM. Yes, in wireless, the 100 \u2013 and we've actually seen that wireless may grow to be a bit bigger than $100 million adder. It could be a $150 million adder or so. But this year, the wireless is probably in that \u2013this is production test, not R&D test, but it's probably in that $70 million \u2013 $60 million to $70 million range for the market. Well, I think history is interesting in this. If you look at 2016 and 2017, actually our smartphone related business was pretty flat and consistent and hot. Those were peak years in the past, and it was 2 successive year. So I think the on/off, on/off pattern goes back to the earlier part of the decade, but I think 2016 and 2017 are equally valid thoughts and models around that. So that's one thought. It doesn't necessarily mean up and down, but at some point it's not going to be what's norm in baseline I think is a judgment, but I'd go back to that sort of trend line of the market. We expect to grow 6% to 7%. So if the SOC market this year is again, let's say, $3.3 billion, nominally, we're talking about a market that should be $3.4 billion, $3.5 billion, everything else being equal next year. So I do think we can have two sequential strong years because we've had them in the past, and there's nothing wrong with that. Plus we have these new design wins coming online that haven't matured yet. And then the thing we haven't talked about that's out there is memory. Memory is having a pretty strong year this year. And if you look into 2021, the 2021 era is going to see this large shift from DDR4 to DDR5. This year, we're at the very early innings of the LPDDR5 shift for more mobile devices, but the DDR5 shift is coming. And as we said, that obsoletes the installed base of DRAM test equipment for final test. So there's a big retooling coming there as well. Go a bogey, I think is \u2013 so let me just add a few more comments about where we are. So you're right. We've seen the market show sequential annual growth for quite some length of time here. This year, it's maybe going to be about flat, but it may show a 4%, 5% growth as well by the time the year is over. And that's absent any real interesting participation of automotive and industrial buying. This is heavy, heavy mobility. And it's also in the midst of a pandemic. And it's also in the midst of all the regulations coming in around China. So I'll go back and say, I would model in a 6% to 8% TAM growth rate for SOC over the mid-term, four to five years. That is what we should be tracking at. Yes, I'm not going to break out our LPDDR5 revenue, but I will say that the increase in the market size is both flash and DRAM. It's about two thirds DRAM and one third flash compared to our estimate in January. So we are seeing upside on flash too. And much of the upside in DRAM is related to LPDDR5. So you would expect \u2013 and because our share is kind of going to be flat, you can derive a close estimate of maybe how much revenue is coming out of that for us this year. And we're working on design wins to hopefully capture more of the DRAM market. We just introduced that product in Q4 of last year and we're ramping it this year. So that's what gives us upside going into next year, we think around DDR5, and we talked in earlier calls about our sort of 40% to 45% market share that we have should \u2013 with the products we have today and the competitive position we have today, we should be able to move that into the 50% \u2013 low 50% range here in the next couple of years, if we really execute well. So that's what we're focused on in planning. Okay."

            "name": "Sanjay Mehta",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll review how the pandemic is impacting us from a financial supply line management perspective. I will then summarize our Q2 financial results and Q3 outlook. Our priorities remain consistent during the coronavirus pandemic, safety of our employees, supporting our customers and crisp execution to achieve our financial objectives. In line with my Q1 earnings call remarks, I wanted to acknowledge the continued challenges, our employees, customers, suppliers, and their families going through during this pandemic. From a financial point of view, Teradyne is stronger than ever. We generated $178 million of free cash flow in Q2 and ended the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion in cash and marketable securities and no short-term debt. During the quarter, we established a $400 million revolving line of credit for added security against future uncertainty and opportunities. The strength of our balance sheet, business model and business execution enabled us to put the revolver in place during a very uncertain time. Our long-term debt is a $460 million face value convert, which matures in December of 2023. From an operations perspective, our team and partners have done a great job so far this year. Over many years, Teradyne has built a global supply line management team second to none and the value of that team has never been more evident. COVID-related supply line issues did not have a material impact on our revenues in Q2. Our combined teams produce the highest number of UltraFLEX systems ever in the second quarter, ramped new products in SOC, memory and across our IA businesses all while operating in a very challenging environment. This included overcoming numerous part and labor shortages along with logistical constraints. In one case, the shortage of scheduled air cargo capacity led us to charter a dedicated 747 to deliver, quite literally, plane load of testers to a customer to ensure timely delivery. While operationally executing very well, we continue to take a critical view of how to strengthen our supply chain operations. We have identified potential weaknesses and are taking actions to strengthen our operations further. The short-term COVID-19 related actions along with these long-term actions have a small impact on margins. While the operations team clearly shined in the quarter, they were not alone. I'd also like to extend thanks to the entire organization from HR to facilities and environmental health, to engineering, repair services, finance, legal, our global field and applications teams, which collectively allowed us to meet our delivery commitments at a revolver, introduce new products, maintain our R&D programs and run the company safely and productively with combination of at-home and on-site staffing. Well done. Very well done. Now on to the details of the quarter. Revenue in Q2 was $839 million, up 49% from Q2 of 2019, and up 46% for the first half of the year. Q2 revenue was 5% above the high end of the range driven by accelerated shipments in SOC test. Also while IA contracted year-over-year, IA revenue was higher than expected in Q2. Semi Test revenue was $659 million, up 76% from a year ago, driven by; one, SOC revenue was $575 million, up 82% from a year ago on broad strength and mobility. And two, memory revenue of $85 million, up 45% from a year ago, due to continued strength in flash test and ramp up of our Magnum Epic solution for DRAM. In System Test, revenues were $72 million, which included storage test shipments of $36 million, which were down sequentially, but up 6% from Q2 of 2019. Recall our storage test business tends to have lumpy shipments. First half storage test revenue was up 106% over the first half of 2019 on strengthen in both system level test and HDD product lines. Growth in SLT was driven primarily by processor demand while HDD shipments were driven by strong exabyte growth for hard drives. LitePoint revenue was $49 million in the quarter, up 19% from Q2 of 2019 on 5G WiFi 6 and next generation WiFi 6E demand. In industrial automation, revenue was $59 million, down 21% from Q2 of 2019 due to the coronavirus and down 3% from Q1 2020, but above our plan entering the quarter. UR contributed $43 million of revenue, near $11 million. AG and Energid made up the remainder. We believe in our IE segment revenue bottomed out in Q2, and is on the road to a sequential growth in Q3. We had one 10% customer in the quarter. As a reminder, we disclosed customers who contribute 10% or more of full year company revenue in our annual 10-K. Non-GAAP gross margins in the quarter were 56.2%, down 130 basis points from Q2 of 2019 as forecasted. Margins reflect the impact of concentrated mobility shipments in Semi Test and the added logistics and operations costs due to the pandemic. Non-GAAP operating expenses were up $11 million to $207 million from Q1 due to company performance causing higher variable compensation. Inventory increased to $206 million to support Q3 shipments and buffer against potential COVID-related supply disruptions. DSO in the quarter increased to 75 days due to the timing of shipments in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating margin was 31.5% and non-GAAP EPS was $1.33. Both are tracking ahead of our 2022 model. Tax rate in Q2 2020 was 13% on a GAAP basis and 14.1% on a non-GAAP basis. Our full year GAAP tax rate is expected to be 14%, down from our prior estimate of 14.5%. Our full year non-GAAP tax rate is expected to be 14.5%, down from our prior estimate of 15%. The decrease in tax rate is due to product mix. We generated $178 million in free cash flow in Q2. We paid $17 million in dividends in the quarter. We bought back 173,000 shares for $9.4 million at an average price of $54.49 in the first few days of the quarter. As noted in April, we suspended our share repurchase program as of April 1. We look at our share repurchase and the entire capital allocation program regularly and we'll update you next quarter. Looking ahead at Q3, revenues will include a significant ramp in shipments of our new UltraFLEXplus SOC test system supporting recent design wins. In memory, we expect continued strong momentum for our Magnum product line for flash and DRAM applications. LPDDR5 test shipments are expected to grow significantly in Q3. In our system test group, storage test demand driven by system level tests and hard disk drive markets continue to see end market demand exceeding our expectations for the year. While this business fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter, Q3 is expected to more than double the Q2 level. I'll also note that while we expect multiple waves of 5G-related demand for both handsets and infrastructure in the years ahead, we are not planning on significant infrastructure test shipments in the second half, like we experienced in 2019. As a result, we expect to revert back to pre-2019 pattern of lower Q4 SOC shipments. In industrial automation, we are seeing incremental improvements in UR's business. As the U.S. and Europe start to open up, we are seeing signs of increased momentum in quarter-over-quarter. Recall the U.S. and Europe typically represent greater than 70% of UR's revenue. MiR continues to execute and in the first half of the year, grew by 4% year-over-year driven by ultraviolet light disinfectant demand. In Q3, we are guiding a revenue range of $745 million to $805 million and a non-GAAP EPS of $1.01 to $1.17 on 175 million of diluted shares. The ranges reflect continued coronavirus supply risks and potential impact on end market demand. The guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles and non-cash imputed interest on convertible debt. In April, we previewed expected gross margin headwinds in the second half of 2020 due to new product ramps. While the ramps continue as planned, our latest view is the impact will be less severe than earlier expected. Q3 gross margins will be 55% to 56%. We expect to be back to historical gross margin levels in 2021. In Q3, operating expenses are expected to be 26% to 28% of sales and are on track with our revised April full-year plan to grow 7% to 8% from 2019. The operating profit at the midpoint of our third quarter guidance is 29%. CapEx investments year-to-date are $84 million. And we expect full year investments with total approximately $175 million. We're investing more in CapEx this year to support new product rollouts, strengthening our supply chain and new facility projects. To summarize, we close out Q2 with outstanding financial and operational performance in a difficult working environment. We enter Q3 with a bright outlook on the strength of new product ramps and an industrial automation market that is showing signs of early improvement. While our visibility is limited and we're not immune to macroeconomic shocks. I'm confident that we have the products, people and processes to thrive in the quarters ahead. With that, I'll turn things back to Andy. Hi, it's Sanjay here. Yes, I think this year; we'll come close or be in the range of hitting our earnings model out in 2022, and on the top line and the bottom line. And obviously there's many puts and takes relative to what we published in the earnings model, specifically strengthened Semi Test and storage business offsetting the near term impacts of COVID and the IA portfolio. What we'll plan on doing is in January updating that earnings model and provide guidance for the future then. Yes. Hi, it's Sanjay. So, we do a lot of work and trying to triangulate our shipments and then trying to understand utilization and inventory levels of testers out there. And I think what you saw in 2019 as Mark articulated earlier was a buildup of infrastructure test tooling and which kind of built the capacity. So they could have a run rate. From an end market and inventory perspective, we're not seeing test or inventory build. We're always on the lookout for it and concerned about it. But from the analysis we've done, we actually don't see that inventory buildup. Yes. Mainly from the tester equipment, it's very hard from an end market perspective, be it smartphone or industrial or automotive to think about those inventories. Yes, we're effectively guiding down 35% to 40% versus Q3 mid. Yes. Hi, it's Sanjay here. So the compute market is roughly annually $500 million to $600 million. And our share has been roughly 30% give or take historically. Our new UltraFLEXplus product will help us grow that share. And this initial design win will help along that journey. So that's how we're thinking about it in the near term. Yes. Hi, Sanjay here. So I think over since 2015, we've experienced significant growth in UR than adding MiR in 2018 and then as well as AutoGuide in 2019. And that growth we expected to continue in 2020. Obviously, COVID hit, and we're looking at potentially a contraction year depending on how the market shakes out in the second half. However, our belief is that we're going to continue over the long run to grow at the 20% to 35% as Mark stated in his prepared remarks. And really I think that you consider over the short-term, I think there's going to need to be a balance of getting people back to work versus industrial automation. However, in the business development activities, we're seeing a lot of activity in this plant managers and decision makers looking to harden their production lines and social distance. So, we are seeing activity even in the short-term. I think in the long-term, it will provide a tailwind. However, we're still in the mid-term around the 20% to 35% growth, and we still continue to invest in product differentiation and application differentiation in those businesses. In storage. Hi. It's Sanjay here. So I'll talk a little bit about kind of the GO and kind of monthly profile. So for UR, when I take a look at China, first to go into COVID and first to kind of come out, and when we take a look at kind of the monthly profile, we saw improvement in March and then sequentially we saw improvement throughout the quarter and really kind of coming back strong. And when we take a look at not back to last year's levels, but improving Q2 over Q1 and based on the forecast we see that improvement continuing. But when we take that recipe of opening up and we look at the data and look at the U.S. and Europe, which is over 70% of the historical UR business, we're very encouraged. And so, we are seeing business development activities. We are seeing growth coming, but really the baseline is China and the business activity in the U.S. as well as Europe. And from a product perspective from the applications, we're continuing to invest. We've recently have launched in April our ActiNav for bin picking. And we continue to drive for ease of implementation activities and really growing the ecosystem. Yes, so I think I mentioned earlier in 2019, we were profitable and our full year plan in 2020 pre-COVID was a heavy investment year in IA, both on the engineering side as well as the go-to market side. And we still plan in IA to be profitable at similar levels in 2020. COVID hits and then you \u2013 we're faced with a situation of not having the revenue growth. So we meet or down a lot of the go-to-market spends and that was a significant reduction. However, we continued forward with the engineering and application spend significantly. So, what you're seeing in the immediate short-term aside from kind of the re-vectoring that we did in metering down kind of the selling and marketing or go-to market spending is you're seeing more and more online marketing, more and more virtual trade shows, et cetera, and kind of restricted travel, obviously. So, you're seeing a short-term reduction in selling and marketing spend. However, you are seeing a little bit of travel and those types of costs within the engineering ranks, but we're continuing to significantly invest on that front. We are \u2013 I don't believe in 2020, we will \u2013 it's very uncertain depending on the revenue levels in the back half of the year. But we're teetering on. It just really depends on the top line, but we are \u2013 I want to reiterate that we are encouraged by the activity of Q3 and \u2013 as well as the ramp up in China for UR in Q2 and we expect that to continue."

At this time, all participant lines have been placed in a listen-only mode and later we will open the floor for your questions. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Andrew Blanchard to begin. Please go ahead sir.\nAndrew Blanchard: Thank you, Maria and good morning everyone, and welcome to our discussion of Teradyne\u2019s most recent financial results. I\u2019m joined this morning by our CEO, Mark Jagiela; and the CFO, Sanjay Mehta. Following our opening remarks, we\u2019ll provide details of our performance for 2020's first quarter and full year along with our outlook for the second quarter of 2020. The press release containing our first quarter results was issued last evening. We\u2019re providing slides on the Investor page of the website that may be helpful to you in following the discussion. Replays of this call will be available via the same page after the call ends.  The matters that we discuss today will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause Teradyne\u2019s results to differ materially from management\u2019s current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statements contained in the earnings release as well as our most recent SEC filings. Additionally, those forward-looking statements are made as of today and we take no obligation to update them as a result of developments occurring after this call. During today\u2019s call, we\u2019ll make reference to non-GAAP financial measures. We have posted additional information concerning these non-GAAP financial measures including reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure were available on the Investor page of our website. Also, please take special note of the Safe Harbor Statement in the press release and slide deck for risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic and potential changes to U.S. export regulations. Looking ahead between now and our next earnings call, Teradyne expects to participate in technology or industrial focused investor conferences hosted by Wolfe Research, R.W. Baird, Bank of America, Cowen, UBS, and Stifel.  Now, let\u2019s get on with the rest of the agenda. First, Mark will comment on our recent results and the market conditions including how we are responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. Sanjay will then offer some more details on our quarterly results, along with our guidance for the second quarter. We\u2019ll then answer your questions. And this call is scheduled for one hour. Mark?\nMark E. Jagiela: Hello everyone and thanks for joining us. Today I will describe how we're responding to the COVID-19 pandemic including our high level results for the first quarter. I'll then provide some context for how we're looking at the second quarter and the market conditions we are observing. Sanjay will then provide the financial details and more specifics on how we're managing in the current environment. COVID-19 has shaken the global economy, and it's unclear how long the restrictions on daily life will continue or what the longer-term economic implications might be. However, as you read in our press release, demand for our test products remains very strong throughout the first quarter and we were able to deliver revenue and earnings near and above the top end of our guidance respectively. As you might expect, the Teradyne team and our partners overcame numerous supply, production, and logistics obstacles during the quarter and I could not be more proud of their work.  Employee health and well-being has been our top priority at Teradyne. Globally the majority of our employees are working from home while some of our operations, supply line, and customer support teams must be onsite we are providing them with the necessary protective resources and procedures to minimize their exposure risk. Supply line challenges continue to come our way and the unusually large revenue guidance range in Q2 reflects this challenge. Sanjay will give you more details on our supply line response.  Application support projects are vital to the short-term and long-term success of both Teradyne and our customers. These projects are largely on track, with employees assisting customers onsite where necessary but using enhanced safety protocols. R&D projects are moving full speed ahead and with minor exceptions are on schedule despite the rapid shift to significant number of engineers working remotely. While we are watching this closely to ensure we get ahead of any potential productivity loss from this remote work arrangements, so far things seem to be proceeding on plan. So in summary, despite the numerous challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Teradyne team is executing and delivering one of the largest ramps of tester shipments in history. Moments like these really stand out in our careers and it feels great to be part of this team.  Turning to the business, as of yet demand for test equipment remains little impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. While there is incremental softening in the automotive sector that's been more than made up for by strengthening of mobility, 5G, and memory test demand. On the other hand, our industrial automation business saw a decline in Q1, which we expect will deepen in Q2 as Europe and North American manufacturing remains impacted by shutdowns.  Now let's review how Q1 unfolded and how we're looking at Q2. Given the uncertainty in both supply and demand, we will not be making any full year projections in our comments today. At the total Teradyne level our first quarter sales were up 43% from first quarter of 2019 and our non-GAAP earnings per share were up 85%. In semi test sales were up 42% from Q1 2019, of that SoC test was up 37%. As expected 5G infrastructure test buying slowed in the quarter and handset related buying strengthened. This trend continues into 2Q as well.  Part of our growth comes from the mobility design wins we highlighted last year, but the biggest driver is the same thing we've been describing for years. The increasing complexity of silicon in handsets drives up test time, which in turn drives demand for more testers even in the face of flat to down handset unit volume. Increased complexity comes from more powerful apps processors, new technologies like Wi-Fi 6G and 5G, more cameras with higher pixel counts, and increasingly sophisticated sensors and displays.  Tester demand for the specific 5G modem and RF components in handsets is growing in 2020, but remains modest. Much of the early 5G deployment will use low band sub 6G technology, while millimeter wave will be a small percentage of 5G handset shipments this year. However, there is growing demand for millimeter wave testing capabilities both in semi test and at light point. The industry is building capacity for this technology from near zero so much of this demand is to put initial capacity in place for early production.  On the infrastructure side the global build out is still in the early innings and we expect test demand to ebb and flow as the network build out moves through various geographies. Memory test is another bright story. Revenues were up 76% from Q1 2019. The LPDDR5 ramp on our Magnum epic test system was the highlight of the quarter, as DRAM Final Test is a new and promising segment for us. We expect that ramp to continue in second quarter. From a revenue perspective though, flash test shipments were the dominant controller in the quarter. The latest protocol interface standards in flash are pushing interface speeds higher, driving a refresh of packaged test systems. We expect this trend to also continue in the second quarter.  Additionally, we saw healthy shipments for indigenous Chinese memory production in the first quarter. In the system test group sales doubled from the first quarter of 2019, with storage tests standing out with sales of over $75 million in the quarter. This was more than three times the level of a year ago quarter as demand for both HDD and system level test remains strong. Our defense and aerospace business grew over 30% in the quarter year-on-year, while production board tests softened on slower automotive electronics demand. In wireless test light point sales were up 50% year-on-year on increased demand for both connectivity and cellular related test systems. Like semi test light point shipments are building foundational capacity for 5G handset tests and benefiting from the Wi-Fi fixed transition.  Shifting to industrial automation, revenue in Q1 was down about 10% year-on-year as the improving outlook for universal robots in Asia, which we saw in Q4, was stopped dead in its tracks by the COVID-19 pandemic in Q1. In Europe and North America UR also faced increasing headwinds as the quarter progressed. On the other hand, MiR's autonomous mobile robots delivered roughly flat sales in the quarter compared with a year ago period. We believe the opportunities for automation will accelerate post pandemic as businesses see the resilience benefit of a more automated workflow. There will also be the opportunity in the likely realignment of localized manufacturing of critical supplies and a heavy reliance on warehouse automation and logistics automation.  To that end, our investment in new products, distribution, and organizational capability continues at full speed. In March, we introduced the MiR250 Autonomous Mobile Robot and the AutoGuide MaxN10 Pallet Stacking autonomous forklift. In April, Universal Robots formally introduced the market's most capable industrial bin picking product ActiNav. ActiNav is a UR Plus application that uses 3D vision and a proprietary path planning software in an easy to deploy plug and play solution. It provides the necessary hand-eye coordination to both precisely pick parts from bins and precisely place parts in a manufacturing flow.  Finally, let's jump up and look at the big picture. Our 1Q demand was very strong and we were nimble enough to fulfill that demand despite the COVID-19 challenges. Our Q2 demand looks even stronger and the team is focused on knocking down supply bottlenecks to realize another great quarter. However, we recognize that we're not operating in a vacuum. The midterm impact of rolling economic shutdowns remains uncertain in many industries, including our own. Bear in mind that volatility is not new to us. We have an operating model that can flex up and down with extreme demand swings and still remain profitable. We have employees across the company that have weathered severe economic storms in the past and in each case we've emerged better positioned competitively.  You will note that we have suspended our stock buyback as a prudent hedge until the future impact becomes a bit clear. At the same time, we also anticipate an increased likelihood of M&A opportunities later in the year. Either way, our rock solid balance sheet will be an asset in the quarters to come. Longer term, we know technology relentlessly marches onward providing solutions to global challenges and enriching all of our lives. We remain confident in the long-term outlook for our test and automation markets and in our strategy to excel at serving them. Sanjay will now take you through the financial details. Sanjay.\nSanjay Mehta: Thank you, Mark. Good morning everyone. This morning I'll provide details on how we're managing our operations, spending and capital allocation in this uncertain environment. I will then cover our Q1 results and our Q2 outlook. I first want to acknowledge the tough environment our employees, customers, suppliers and their families are going through. For those that have family or friends with COVID-19, I wish you a speedy recovery and hope this pandemic will be behind us soon. I would like to thank our employees and suppliers for your extraordinary efforts and our customers for your patience and confidence in Teradyne.  As Mark noted earlier, our priorities are the safety of our employees, supporting our customers, and continued execution in achieving our financial objectives. While we can't predict the duration of this pandemic and its economic consequences, we enter this pandemic in a strong financial position with a flexible business model. Specifically, we have 905 million of cash and marketable securities at the end of Q1 with no short-term debt. We have a $460 million face value convertible bond that's due in December 2023. We have a diverse portfolio of businesses in test and industrial automation. These businesses continue to service their markets with a leading set of products. Our test businesses continue to have tailwinds behind them with new technology introductions, introductions like various flavors of 5G, and new memory standards like LPDDR5. This is balanced by the contraction of our industrial automation businesses due to both weaknesses in the auto industry and COVID-19.  A couple of points on our expense model, the test equipment market is cyclical, hence we've structured our company's expenses to be able to handle large demand swings. Total expenses are set at a level to ensure we generate cash during periods of low market demand while retaining maximum flexibility to scale up. For example, manufacturing for our test portfolios mainly outsourced to contract manufacturers. Therefore, much of our cost of goods sold are flexible as we are not burdened with the extensive fixed costs. We have an efficient operating expense model where portions of our engineering, operations, and G&A functions are in low cost regions. Lastly, our compensation structure varies with our revenue and profit levels.  As Mark noted, we are continuing to invest in our engineering roadmaps across the company. This includes significant 5G, AI, and memory related investments in test. We're also investing to support the pullout of our UR Plus application kits, including our ActiNav industrial bin picking product just introduced by Universal Robots, a new product roadmaps at MiR and AutoGuide as well as key IP that will benefit us in the years to come. Another key investment focus this year will be our supply line. While the bulk of our production is in Asia close to our customers, the supply line supporting that production is truly global. As Q1 demonstrated, our internal team and partners did an outstanding job in difficult circumstances to meet our customer delivery requirements. This experience has not only reinforced the value of our operations team, but has identified areas that we could improve. These are primarily in areas of adding redundancy for critical components and manufacturing capacity. We're taking these lessons learned to strengthen the supply chain further in the days ahead, and these will have an impact on our costs.  Now to Q1, company revenues were 704 million, up 43% year-over-year. Semi test revenue of 484 million was up over 40% from Q1 of 2019 driven by handset related SoC demand and strengthened flash final test. In memory, we also ramped LPDDR5 revenues tied to our Q4 design win. System test group had revenue of $116 million which doubled year-over-year driven by strong -- driven by storage test solutions primarily for terabyte [ph] class near line drives as system tests -- as well as system tests solutions. Industrial automation or IA revenue of $60 million was down year-over-year on manufacturing weakness amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic. In March, we did see some improvement in China, our fastest growing market in 2019, which is an encouraging sign and hopefully a leading indicator for countries to get back towards pre-COVID-19 work environments. Light Point had revenue of $43 million and grew 50% year-over-year with cellular 5G and the new connectivity standard Wi-Fi 6 driving revenue.  Non-GAAP gross margins were 57.6%, down a point quarter-over-quarter due to product mix. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were down $7 million to $197 million from the fourth quarter due to lower discretionary spending and timing of expenditures, slightly offset by higher variable compensation on higher profit. Non-GAAP operating profit rate was 30% and non-GAAP EPS was a dollar. The tax rate excluding discrete items for the quarter and year was 14.5% on a GAAP basis and 15% on a non-GAAP basis. The improvement in tax rate is driven by a higher revenue mix from our test portfolio than planned.  Turning to share buybacks, we bought back 1.3 million shares for $79 million at an average price of $58.81 in the first quarter. Effective April 1st, we have suspended our share repurchase program. There are two reasons why we made the decision to preserve cash at this time. Firstly, as we look forward there is uncertainty of the depth and the duration of the economic impact of COVID-19. Secondly, we wanted to retain more cash on the balance sheet to enable M&A opportunities which may present themselves in the near-term. As Q1 is typically our lowest cash generation quarter we generated $6 million in free cash flow as we paid annual variable compensation in Q1. Share buybacks and dividends were primary drivers of our $111 million of cash decline in Q1.  Turning to Q2, given the volatile environment -- Turning to Q2 revenue range, sorry, given the volatile environment that we're facing we've widened our guidance range to reflect the various scenarios we're considering. The first assumption is that second or third waves of the virus do not force countries to shut down essential semiconductor businesses. The second assumption is that semiconductors retain the status of being considered essential by governments when imposing stay at home work orders. The third assumption is that our operations team continues to be able to mitigate supply chain and production issues globally.  From a demand perspective I would also like to remind you of a couple of important points. First, we have a concentrated demand in Q2 related to Smartphone handsets and their associated launches. As you know, Smartphone demand can change quickly and while our guidance reflects our latest estimates, we're not immune to the short-term changes in demand that could materially change our outlook for Q2. Second, we're not operating in normal conditions, so normal seasonality may not come into play in the future quarters.  Now to our Q2 outlook, sales are expected to be between $690 million and $800 million. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.86 to a $1.16 on 173 million of diluted shares. Second quarter guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles and the non-cash computed interest on the convertible debt. Second quarter gross margins are estimated at 55% to 56% down approximately 2% at the midpoint from Q1. There are two factors causing the margin decline. First, incremental costs associated with COVID-19 are being incurred to ensure our supply line as noted prior. This impact results in just under half of the margin decline. Second, increased mix of mobility business in the quarter drives just over half of the margin decline.  Margins expected in Q2 follows similar historical pattern when there is a sales mix bias towards mobility. Second half of 2020 gross margins are expected to further decline from Q2 due to continued growth in new product ramps which have not come down the cost curve such as the UltraFLEX Plus and Millimeter Wave solutions. We expect to return to our historical gross margins in 2021. OPEX spending will increase from the first quarter due to incremental test investments in both R&D and SG&A. Incremental IA investments were focused on distribution and product development investments. OPEX is expected to run at 27% to 30% of second quarter sales. The non-GAAP operating profit at the midpoint of our second quarter guidance is 27%. Regarding our OPEX plans for the full year, in light of the changes we discussed earlier, our latest estimate projects 2020 OPEX to grow about 7% to 8% from $758 million in 2019. This is down from our January guide.  In closing, these are challenging times and we believe we are well-positioned to execute over the period of demand volatility. We have a diversified portfolio of businesses and customers, strong cash position and balance sheet, taking actions to reinforce our business against an uncertain future while continuing to strategically invest in customer support and product roadmaps that will power our future success. As we proceed ahead we'll make changes if needed in line with the foundational [Technical Difficulty] noted. When this pandemic and resulting societal impacts recede we're confident that the global economic and demographic forces will continue to make the electronics test and industrial automation industries attractive growth markets. With that, I'll turn things back to Andy. \nAndrew Blanchard: Thanks, Sanjay. Maria we would now like to take some questions and as a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up. \nOperator: Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Brian Chin of Stifel.\nBrian Chin: Hi there, good morning. Congratulations on the strength of the results and appreciate you are not making this into a Zoom conference call. My first question would be maybe just to sort of reconcile the strength you're seeing in your business, there clearly is a wide range of expectations for what semi growth could be in 2020 and understand why you are skewing lower as expectations for markets like Smartphones and automotive have been lowered, what's the complexity and sort of your success in terms of expanding platforms in test and to cut new customers is certainly one factor, how would you further reconcile the strength of your business with sort of the declining growth expectations further downstream? And I guess more bluntly, do you also plan for some form of rationalization of test capacity beyond the second quarter? \nMark E. Jagiela: Okay, there's a lot in there. But, I think it is perhaps a little bit incoherent to see such strong tester demand when people are talking about the uncertainty or declining in unit volumes, particularly in handsets. But I think this is not unprecedented. This is back to the issue of it's not so much the number of phones that are being produced, it's the complexity of the silicon in the phones and the associated test time. And that's obviously and absolutely what's occurring at the moment. So whether we were in the midst of a COVID pandemic or not, the business right now would be equally robust. And I don't believe it's overbuying or sort of there's a rationalization necessarily provided this economic impact doesn't persist into next year and slow down the rate of complexity growth, which is a possibility. We don't know if that will happen, but it's a possibility. But I think with so many things coming together this year around features in phones like the new Wi-Fi standard, some of the new sensor technologies, and of course 5G, that it's just driving a lot of complexity increase. And so I don't think the test business, you can necessarily correlate that well with the end markets for semiconductors because of that. You certainly see automotive down, way down. And we see that in our business industrial down and we see that in our business for test. But mobility is quite strong.\nBrian Chin: I appreciate that. Maybe even sort of against those comments, you know, I think it was early 2017, there was also quite a great deal of strength from mobile processor that you saw in your business in terms of the test capacity additions that occurred in early 2017. Would you use that as an analog relative to what you're seeing now in terms of maybe complexity or also not maybe exceptionally strong, phone unit environment as well?\nMark E. Jagiela: Yeah, I think it's reasonably analogous. And therefore, year-to-year, what you've seen in our business for test is that it's not monotonic or consistent year-to-year in terms of our business in the second and third quarter related to mobility. In the years where there's a lot of technological change, we get incrementally more growth in revenue. And then there's some years where the change is more modest and it'll be down. So that's going to be part of our future, as far as the eye can see. So we really look at it as a trend line and, yes, this is a particularly strong year.\nBrian Chin: Alright. I appreciate that. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini of SIG.\nMehdi Hosseini: Thanks for taking question. Mark, I want to go back to your comment back in January earnings conference call, you characterized the first half versus second half as 55-45. In other words, it's 55% of your 2020 revenue would be captured in the first half. And I do understand lack of visibility. But just given how strong your first answer is, would you -- I agree that your first step could actually be more than 55% of the 2020 revenues?\nMark E. Jagiela: It certainly could be. I think what we've seen since the January call is that what we described as sort of the first and second quarters being roughly equal is close to right. I think we've seen a little more strengthening in the second quarter than we projected back then. And we've seen Q1 turn out to be a little bit higher at the high end of our guide than back then. So it's come in a little bit hotter and therefore, it certainly could be that the percentage skew toward the first half could be higher. The thing about the second half though it's not a -- there is no model out there we can rely on to predict what's going to happen. So, at the moment the demand, even the backlog and the deliveries we're quoting through the third quarter are pretty strong, but we know that can change in a moment's notice.\nMehdi Hosseini: Sure, thank you. And I want to go back to your use of cash in terms of the priorities for M&A if they were to happen in the second half, what is the priority for you, would semi tests or areas adjusting to semi tests now become a priority or would you focus on industrial automation and making additional investment there?\nSanjay Mehta: Yeah, hey buddy, it's Sanjay here. So, I think that we have an active M&A group that we've look at many different opportunities in the last several years. Obviously, the focus has been on industrial automation, but we are actively looking and the key part of that strategy is that as valuations potentially come down in the future, products -- or companies have a good fit and become more attractive financially. And so I'd say, historically and even looking forward there'll be a focus on industrial automation. But I wouldn't count anything now.\nMehdi Hosseini: Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya of Bank of America Securities.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Mark, I understand the argument about complexity growing in mobile, but I imagine that was known at the start of the year but since then, Smartphone volume expectations have come down. I think the assumption is that down high single digit or so. So is it that 5G mix is better. I'm just curious what could have cost a tester demand to improve when volumes have been revised downwards? And as part of that, if you could give us some color about how much of that incremental strength that you are seeing is from China domestic customers versus the U.S. and Korean customers?\nMark E. Jagiela: Yeah, so I think first of all, it's a good question. Most of the test capacity that is being installed in second and third quarter is for production of handsets that will occur in third, fourth quarter of this year. So the falloff in handsets that we've seen in Q1 and Q2, there is no relationship on that demand. It's related to what do people think, the unit volume for new phones, not in aggregate, but for new phones will be in the second half of the year. And apparently going just by the strength in the business that view is still pretty robust. The other thing that changes as you go from January till now is people start to get a better sense of the complexity impact on test time. So there's some preliminary views back in January but as you get closer to mass production, the reality of what that test time is sets in and can drive up or down demand.  We saw several years ago if you remember a situation where the progression from January to April resulted in a reduction of test capacity because test time turned out to be better than people thought. In this particular situation that's not the case, it's moving a bit in the other direction. So those are the two things I think that are going on that are causing demand to be incrementally stronger despite the fact that in the first half the old handsets unit volumes are down. And then on China versus anyplace else, we're seeing very strong demand across the board. It's not one geography, it's Korea, it's China, it's U.S., it's just a generally competitive robust plan around new technology for phones.\nVivek Arya: Got it, very helpful. And for my follow-up Sanjay you mentioned some pressure on second half gross margin and I think you said Q2 would be 55% to 56%. Could you give us a sense for what specifically in the mix -- and I understand of course industrial automation is lower so maybe that is having an impact. But beyond that what is having the impact on Q2 gross margin and then where can second half gross margin be, I don't understand what about new product ramps can take gross margins down so much in these quarters when your sales growth is so strong year-on-year? \nSanjay Mehta: Sure, so going down about 2% from Q1 is at the midpoint is what I said and really half -- think about it, over half of the decline is tied to the concentration of sales mix and mobility. That's not unlike the patterns we've seen in the past. The second part would be and I mentioned in my prepared remarks we've had to strengthen our supply chain and many costs associated with the COVID-19 impact which is just under half of the impact. So that really kind of bridges you from Q1 to Q2. And then getting on to your second question about the second half, first let me comment and say the second half there's tremendous demand uncertainty. As you'd expect with different businesses we have we could have -- could come in or not come in so that product mix would have an impact. But that being said we're really seeing the adoption of several new products and solutions specifically the UltraFLEX Plus platform and Millimeter Wave really take hold and volumes ramping a little bit faster than we had predicted. And these are platforms if you recall that last over 10 years and in their infancy stage they come down a cost curve. And so -- and we do expect margins to come back in 2021.\nVivek Arya: Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Atif Malik of Citi. \nAtif Malik: Hi, thanks for taking my questions and great job on the execution. Mark you talked about strength of indigenous China in first quarter and we hear about the U.S. government looking into perhaps license fees for chip makers exposed to [indiscernible] for U.S. equipment suppliers and was the demand in this indigenous China what you expected back in January or was there any kind of pulling or any discussions with your customers that they were worried about the license concerns?\nMark E. Jagiela: I don't want to talk about any specific customer situation. All I would say is that there's really been no change in demand from the China region for SoC test since the January call. We've had a little bit of incremental demand maybe on the memory side but things are playing out pretty much as planned on test equipment for China. Light Point may also have seen a little bit up but nothing material.\nAtif Malik: Great and then maybe this one for Sanjay and how are you positioning the industrial automation business differently going into recession. You talked about -- warehouses logistics end markets and more. Are you looking into maybe moving away from the auto end market?\nSanjay Mehta: Yes, so I think industrial automation had some weakness building up to COVID-19 in the auto industry which is a large part of the business. And with the rolling shutdowns in manufacturing in the U.S. and Europe are predominantly big regions for the business. We're seeing that impact and obviously contract year-on-year. We did see some encouraging demand in China in the last couple of weeks of March as well as April to date. We are seeing demand pick up back to pre-COVID levels and it's an encouraging sign as an indicator of how things might return back to normal. But we're still in the early innings on that.  When I think about the business, we guided 10% to 12% OPEX growth in 2020 and we brought that down to 7% to 8%. A lot of that investment decline was really tied to the go to market for industrial automation that we've kept the focus on the product, the ecosystem, etc. But really we had an investment strategy that one, tied to investing for growth. And as the contraction and the uncertainty remains, we've moderated that spend in our plans to come down. But we believe in the fundamentals in the long run and we will as the market comes back and manufacturing comes back, we actually think COVID-19 if ever there's a hope there's a benefit out of it is to highlight the advantages and strengthening your supply chain with industrial automation. Now, this would need to be balanced by getting people back to work. But we will continue to invest in the ecosystem as well as distribution. It's just in 2020, it'll be a little bit less than we anticipated, just given the moderated revenue we're seeing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs.\nToshiya Hari: Good morning, guys and thanks for taking the question. Mark, you talked a little bit about Millimeter Wave in your prepared remarks. I think you noted that contribution in 2020 should be relatively small, but you do expect the technology to contribute to growth in 2021 and beyond. Can you help us quantify how big or how small Millimeter Wave could be for your business this year and what your expectations are for the next couple of years? Then I've got a quick follow up. Thanks.\nMark E. Jagiela: Yeah. So, I think certainly people are beginning to ramp production now of Millimeter Wave, but it's in a small fraction of the handsets that'll be produced this year in the end. And, related to the impact this year, I bound it's somewhere in the high tens of millions of dollars across the company, somewhere in that sort of range. Now, we've said longer-term the total 5G wave should build towards sort of this $400 million to $500 million added to the TAM. And with everything going on right now with sub 6G and with Millimeter Wave and such, maybe we are two thirds of the way into that because we are seeing strong demand for the sub 6G side of this. It's just less test intensive. So, as we go into 2021 I would expect that to grow. And I think those are the sort of bookends.\nToshiya Hari: Got it. Then a quick follow up on the IA side of your business. Over the past couple of years, I think you've talked about going more direct to large customers but I just wanted to check in and sort of confirm how significant or insignificant your direct business is today as a percentage of IA sales. And on the distribution side, I'm curious how much visibility you have into how much inventory your distributors hold today, just given the current environment? Thank you.\nMark E. Jagiela: Yeah. On the direct sales part, that's a program we launched last year and it's something we're doing both in all three of our automation companies that started out heavily distribution oriented. For large accounts MiR UR have moved towards direct sales, but that's really been in effect for a couple of quarters. We're into a downturn now and a lot of those customers were automotive related. So I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I don't think the revenue percentage would be all that significant at this point. On inventory I don't think there's very much of any buildup inventory in the channel around automation. It's a very quick turns business. We look at that pretty carefully every quarter so no overhang there.\nToshiya Hari: Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of CJ Muse of Evercore.\nCJ Muse: Yeah, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question is regarding supply chain, and so curious can you speak to in particular what kind of issues you're seeing in Malaysia, elsewhere in Southeast Asia for downstream customers, whether or not you're seeing plans for any sort of redundancy from those customers given the uncertainty around COVID and your desire to perhaps test and assemble at multiple locations? And then I guess particularly the paradigm as you think about this is kind of a hopefully just a short-term speed bump here. How are you planning to manage your own inventory, so if I recall back during the financial crisis, you had shortages in FPGA etc., which made it difficult to ramp testers coming out of the correction, would love to hear what your plans are today for hopefully a recovery into the future? Thank you.\nSanjay Mehta: Yeah hi, it's Sanjay here. So, from a supply chain perspective I think we've -- our operations team and our supply partners have done yeoman's effort. And if we break it down, when this first -- pandemic first broke out in China, where we have a large contract manufacturer as well as supply chain kind of feeding it specifically, we drove a path or a task force on ensuring to get labor back, ensuring to get materials. And then the first thing we did is we kicked off our supply chain in other parts of the world. And we invested in redundancy from different supply lines into different geographic locations. And so the key takeaway is that we are building both redundancy in the component qualification that feeds our test equipment and industrial automation products and then secondly, in building capacity in different territories. And then as the pandemic grew throughout the world and as you mentioned, Malaysia, the Philippines and different South Asian countries, you had to build redundancy in logistics and the flight lines to both -- for our products to get to customers, but also for our components to actually get to the contract manufacturers to get deployed.  So there's been a significant investment that we're going to strengthen our supply chain and make sure we have clear diversification of supply if in the event the pandemic, which who knows how long it's going to go, will have that strength. And so that's I think part one. And the second thing is we are building obviously our inventories went down just really to kind of meet our demand. And as we're growing, we are currently building inventory in anticipation of delivering, as you saw, the significant range. And, the range is really tied to where do we believe where we can have a high assurance of delivery of that. So we are building inventory at this time. But I think it'll normalize as demand starts to shake out and as the market unfolds.\nCJ Muse: Hopeful, as my follow-up, I guess kind of a two part question. You talked about mobility really the driver for Q2 but, given the commentary around gross margins impacted by Millimeter Wave and UltraFLEX Plus introduction into the back half would suggest perhaps that could continue into the second half. So I guess how do we think about mobility and seasonality? And then as part of that, my understanding with the plus is that same software, very different hardware from the non-plus. And so curious what kind of obsolescence you might see there and as you get new product introductions that are only using the UltraFLEX Plus, what impact might that have on the types of demand for that tool here in 2020 and into 2021?\nSanjay Mehta: Yeah, so I think at the beginning of the year we anticipated a strong first half. It's kind of playing out the way we anticipated it. It is a little bit stronger in Q2 as we've guided in our range. The second half of the year is really opaque. The impact of the economic construction of the pandemic is really unclear at this point. We do know that there has been, relative to our expectations in January, a little bit more of an acceleration of adoption of the UltraFLEX Plus and Millimeter Wave and as I said earlier, given the volatility in the second half, there could be a bunch of puts and takes in the gross margin. With regards to the ramp up of the UltraFLEX, the UltraFLEX has been around for decades and has a long tail. So we don't necessarily see a huge obsolescence risk with the transition as it occurs.\nAndrew Blanchard: Could we have the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri of UBS. \nTimothy Arcuri: Hi, thanks. I guess I had two questions. First, is on [indiscernible]. So I know that you disclosed in the case so direct and indirect through the offsets was 11% of revenue last year. You did say that they were greater than 10% customer in December. It sounds like they were greater than 10% in March. I guess two part question is that the case and are they still expected to be greater than 10% in the June number, I ask that because the disclosures and the Safe Harbor did change quite a bit and it seems like something is clearly likely to happen there, so that revenue seems to be at risk for the back half of the year? And then I had a follow-up, thanks.\nSanjay Mehta: Yeah, so Sanjay here. So, first of all, we don't comment on specific customers. We obviously did disclose in the annual report that ValveA [ph] and affiliates did procure 11% of our business last year, but we specifically won't comment. We did have one 10% customer this quarter.\nTimothy Arcuri: Okay, yeah. I ask because you did say that last quarter so it seems like you have said that in the past but okay. Okay, and then I guess my second question is, can you give us a sense of what the mix is for June, it sounds like on the semi test side memories could be flat to up. I would assume systems test comes down a little bit. You said IA is going to remain pretty weak. So I guess I'm wondering if you can give any color on the mix particularly SS [ph] fee, which seems like it has to be in the 550 million to 575 million range. I just wonder if you can give us any comment there? Thanks. \nSanjay Mehta: I think from a mix perspective I will comment on the specific numbers, but semi testers will -- as you said will be very strong. And as we've messaged as part of mobility, we do expect system test to decline a tad or to decline.\nTimothy Arcuri: Okay, alright. Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar of Cowen and Company. Krish, make sure your line is not mute.\nAndrew Blanchard: Well, let's come back to Krish.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Weston Twigg of KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nWeston Twigg: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Actually, I had two quick ones, one on the industrial automation business. You mentioned that on the other side of this pandemic there should be a nice acceleration of demand which makes total sense. But I'm wondering have you been having conversations with some of these smaller manufacturing operations that may realize they need to invest in automation, or is that just an expectation. In other words, is that comment based on conversations you're having today or just the expectation they would recover?\nMark E. Jagiela: Yeah, I think the conversations today are really not that far out in terms of their headlights, but it's an expectation. But I would say that we've commented that the mobile platform hit near, saw a flat sales quarter-over-quarter, hasn't been as robustly impacted by this pandemic. And part of the reason for that is that there's already applications for that platform in the healthcare space that are growing. So while industrial has been moving down, that's been increasing. And so I think there's partly small to medium sized enterprises will look at automation coming out of this as an -- as a strategic asset. But moving toward some of these other verticals that are likely to disproportionately grow is another part of the calculus on how this growth in industrial automation accelerates coming out of this.\nWeston Twigg: Okay, that's helpful. And then my follow-up is you had talked about supply chain redundancy, good manufacturing capacity redundancy. And I have heard that from other companies as well related to building out semi test demand and I'm wondering if that is part of the near-term strength you're seeing for testing, in other words, are your customers building out some test redundancy and is that a temporary function?\nMark E. Jagiela: You know, I think that's something we're concerned about and to the extent we've checked and looked. We don't see that really. You know, it would be pretty obvious if we saw customers that are trying to test silicon shift or move capacity to an OSATs but typically speaking, the testers are purchased by third party OSAT and they're not very willing to invest in capital unless it's going to be utilized really quickly. And as we've looked at the utilization of the equipment that we've been installing, it seems to be pulled quickly and turned on and utilized right away. So there's not idle capacity being put into the test, semi test channel that we're aware of.\nWeston Twigg: Okay, very helpful. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from line of John Pitzer of Credit Suisse.\nJohn Pitzer: Yeah. Good morning, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Mark, there's been a lot of questions on the SoC test business. Maybe I'll give you one on the memory test, which had a really strong March quarter in fact, you kind of back at both levels we were seeing in 2018 when the spending environment and memory was just significantly better and pick growth was sort of accelerating versus decelerating. So I am kind of curious if you can talk a little bit about some of the complexity drivers there and the market share drivers there, and how sustainable do you think that is in the back half of the year?\nMark E. Jagiela: Yeah, for the back half of the year God knows. But, there are a couple of things going on there that are interesting. One piece of it is that we opened up a new segment of memory tests that we haven't participated in before, which is DRAM final test. And in the DRAM world there's a transition occurring to LPDDR5. That obsoletes the existing fleet of equipment out there. So to the extent memory manufacturers are beginning that shift just from a technological point of view, they have no choice but to buy incremental capacity for it and that's something that's benefiting us in Q1. And likely we will continue through the year, not just Q2 but in beyond. And that has years to go. So that's a tailwind for sure.  The bigger piece of memory in terms of revenue is flash and flashes for many years now have been undergoing a similar generational shift towards high speed. And unlike I would say DRAM, that's kind of very controlled and not -- I wouldn't say a commodity, but the standards around DRAM are kind of ubiquitous. In the case of flash, there is much more bespoke design going on around the protocols for the interface speeds depending on the handset they're going in or the application they're going in. And that diversity drives a lot of incremental test instrument buying to test all that variety. So that's been true historically. It is just as strong right now. And then the other comment I'll make is that new manufacturers that we see coming online in China are not slowing down. They are putting capacity in and that's also a tailwind.\nJohn Pitzer: That's helpful Mark. And then maybe as my follow up the other standout segment this quarter was the system test both sequentially and year-over-year. And you had some comments about strength and near line drives. I'm just kind of curious how big a component of the growth was hard drives and again, can you help us think about sustainability around complexity and share versus just having to rely upon volumes?\nMark E. Jagiela: Yeah. So, hard drives have been a standout and both aspects of what we do with that storage test product are interesting. And I think the hard drive piece is sustainable and it's sustainable pretty much as far as the eye can reasonably see and through next year. And this has been going on for several years now. And, there's only really two predominant manufacturers out there. And so share is a little bit not an issue as much as just as the systemic underlying growth there. And it definitely seems to be there with the increasing density of these drives and volume. On the system level test side, that's a nascent market that's still in early development. It's a semiconductor test market. It's an additional insertion of test for semiconductor tests. And very few manufacturers have adopted that methodology yet. We're fortunately on the leading edge of that adoption. Will it become an industry pervasive methodology where more and more manufacturers decide to add an additional insertion or test step before they ship their final product or not is unclear but compared to what our expectations were a year ago the volume there is certainly exceeded our expectations. So it's a good secular sign.\nJohn Pitzer: Thanks and congratulations again. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Richard Eastman of Baird. \nRichard Eastman: Yes, thanks for sneaking me in here. But just -- first question is just around the industrial automation business and with the business model there and I don't know how the variable fixed cost mix is for the entire IA business but at a $60 million kind of revenue run rate here you know in the first quarter and that perhaps ticks a little bit in the second quarter, was that business a profitable contributor in the first quarter?\nSanjay Mehta: Yeah hi, it is Sanjay here. So, first thing with IA, as we enter into this market we believe that it's on a rapid growth trajectory over the mid-term. We're seeing the impact obviously of the auto weakness in the pandemic but inherently in that our fixed cost as a percentage of the businesses is much higher because we do internal manufacturing. And so we do outsource some subcomponents but fundamentally we inherently have a higher fixed cost structure just because we believe we have a leadership position and that's one of our attributes to hold on to that leadership position. So there is a higher fixed cost component.  The second comment is in 2019 we were profitable, we had plans even though it was a heavy investment year that we've kind of redacted down tied to revenue. We believe we would have a profitable year. In the first quarter with the contraction we weren\u2019t profitable. \nRichard Eastman: Okay the development on the new products they are with the MiR new products and obviously maybe the awaited ActiNav product now being introduced. Is it a reasonable assumption that as we push out to the fourth quarter that the new products plus again making some assumption around the global economy may be improving by the fourth quarter but do we do -- does this sort of kind of look at the IA businesses potentially seeing sales growth in the fourth quarter, is that still on the table year-over-year?\nMark E. Jagiela: It's on the table for sure whether it'll happen or not is a question. I mean fourth quarter is always strong. And the early signs in China, you know, China certainly was an anchor in Q1 on our IA sales but as we've gone into March and into Q2 they've come back pretty strong in IA buying. It could very well set year-over-year records in our IA business. So if that is a mirror image of the rest of the world which we don't know we can certainly see a Q4 in IA that was sequentially up.\nRichard Eastman: Okay and Mark you in the commentary and the slides I didn't notice any updates around the semi SoC test market or memory test market. And I gather from your comments just on the puts and takes and the SoC market obviously strength and mobility IA and the industrial piece was softer. And even in the memory side it seems like a lot of the strength there for you guys is here. But are you still comfortable at this time just with the previous maybe thoughts around the size of the SoC test market as well as memory test market, are they still reasonably good assumptions here at this time? \nMark E. Jagiela: Yeah, I would kind of toss all that overboard unfortunately because we just don't know about the second half. But what I can say is if what we do know about is the first half of the year and if you look at the first half of the year we're running towards the high end in market size in both memory and SoC compared to what we projected that led to the prior estimates. So, if anything -- if this had been a sort of normal year without COVID we probably right now be revising up some of our market size estimates for the year for each segment. But in light of what's happening we really can't comment. \nRichard Eastman: Understood, okay, great, thank you and really fantastic quarter to your team. \nAndrew Blanchard: And operator we are going to try to squeeze just one more and please I know we started a little bit late so could you just give us one more question please. \nOperator: Certainly, our last question will come from the line of Sidney Ho of Deutsche Bank. \nSidney Ho: Great, thanks for squeezing me in. The question is just a follow up to the previous question. I understand you don't want to give full year forecasts for SoC TAM. Is that your view that most of the SoC TAM that get -- I guess the market is going to lose this year will be recovered next year assuming the Corona Virus situation is under control say by the end of this calendar year. Well some of that be lost permanently, maybe you can talk about that by end market? Thanks. \nMark E. Jagiela: Yeah, I think it's just very speculative but I'll give you maybe just a little bit of color and I'll probably regret it. If you go back to what happened in 2008 and 2009 as a reference, it came back with a vengeance in 2010 and you could argue that it sort of on a trend line basis still the hole in that was created in 2009. So the technological progress just drives a underlying test demand in terms of this complexity growth that is cumulative. It can be temporarily squashed through things like a sharp drop in unit volume demand which is what occurred there. But it came back with a vengeance. So the real question then in this situation is when will the unit volume demand recover because the underlying technological growth will likely continue unabated. And I think that's everybody's guess. We expect things, mobility in handsets have been slightly declining now for a couple of years and it's really had little impact on the test demand. If the handset market starts into double-digit declines and that persist through next year I would say it must have some impact on Testament because the complexity underlying complexity growth this year is quite high. It's likely that it'll oscillate year-to-year. So those are just sort of touchstones but no prediction.\nSidney Ho: Okay, that's fair. Maybe my follow up question is in the industrial automation business just to level set, given the pretty sharp deceleration over the last few quarters for the segment and I'm guessing that will continue in Q2, how should we think about the revenue exposure today Q1 or Q2 whatever you want to use to areas that I expected to continue to see weakness namely automotive by end market or maybe some geography. Just trying to understand if things continue to go the wrong way how much of that is at risk?\nSanjay Mehta: Yeah, so it is Sanjay here. So, really we're predicting a downward bias in Q2 just given the fact that there's a lot of filter in place, manufacturing locations are still down. And so we do see a further contraction. Looking forward as I said earlier we did see signs of improvement what I would call getting back to an initial innings in China pre-COVID levels but it's really too early to tell how fast the recovery would be. And we did enter it -- we did enter in the last quarter a little bit of weakness with automotive.\nSidney Ho: Okay, great, thanks. \nAndrew Blanchard: Okay folks, this concludes our call. Thanks for your interest in Teradyne. We look forward to talking to you in the weeks ahead and those still in the queue I'll get back to you straight away. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude Teradyne's first quarter 2020 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Mark E. Jagiela",
            "content": "Hello everyone and thanks for joining us. Today I will describe how we're responding to the COVID-19 pandemic including our high level results for the first quarter. I'll then provide some context for how we're looking at the second quarter and the market conditions we are observing. Sanjay will then provide the financial details and more specifics on how we're managing in the current environment. COVID-19 has shaken the global economy, and it's unclear how long the restrictions on daily life will continue or what the longer-term economic implications might be. However, as you read in our press release, demand for our test products remains very strong throughout the first quarter and we were able to deliver revenue and earnings near and above the top end of our guidance respectively. As you might expect, the Teradyne team and our partners overcame numerous supply, production, and logistics obstacles during the quarter and I could not be more proud of their work.  Employee health and well-being has been our top priority at Teradyne. Globally the majority of our employees are working from home while some of our operations, supply line, and customer support teams must be onsite we are providing them with the necessary protective resources and procedures to minimize their exposure risk. Supply line challenges continue to come our way and the unusually large revenue guidance range in Q2 reflects this challenge. Sanjay will give you more details on our supply line response.  Application support projects are vital to the short-term and long-term success of both Teradyne and our customers. These projects are largely on track, with employees assisting customers onsite where necessary but using enhanced safety protocols. R&D projects are moving full speed ahead and with minor exceptions are on schedule despite the rapid shift to significant number of engineers working remotely. While we are watching this closely to ensure we get ahead of any potential productivity loss from this remote work arrangements, so far things seem to be proceeding on plan. So in summary, despite the numerous challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Teradyne team is executing and delivering one of the largest ramps of tester shipments in history. Moments like these really stand out in our careers and it feels great to be part of this team.  Turning to the business, as of yet demand for test equipment remains little impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. While there is incremental softening in the automotive sector that's been more than made up for by strengthening of mobility, 5G, and memory test demand. On the other hand, our industrial automation business saw a decline in Q1, which we expect will deepen in Q2 as Europe and North American manufacturing remains impacted by shutdowns.  Now let's review how Q1 unfolded and how we're looking at Q2. Given the uncertainty in both supply and demand, we will not be making any full year projections in our comments today. At the total Teradyne level our first quarter sales were up 43% from first quarter of 2019 and our non-GAAP earnings per share were up 85%. In semi test sales were up 42% from Q1 2019, of that SoC test was up 37%. As expected 5G infrastructure test buying slowed in the quarter and handset related buying strengthened. This trend continues into 2Q as well.  Part of our growth comes from the mobility design wins we highlighted last year, but the biggest driver is the same thing we've been describing for years. The increasing complexity of silicon in handsets drives up test time, which in turn drives demand for more testers even in the face of flat to down handset unit volume. Increased complexity comes from more powerful apps processors, new technologies like Wi-Fi 6G and 5G, more cameras with higher pixel counts, and increasingly sophisticated sensors and displays.  Tester demand for the specific 5G modem and RF components in handsets is growing in 2020, but remains modest. Much of the early 5G deployment will use low band sub 6G technology, while millimeter wave will be a small percentage of 5G handset shipments this year. However, there is growing demand for millimeter wave testing capabilities both in semi test and at light point. The industry is building capacity for this technology from near zero so much of this demand is to put initial capacity in place for early production.  On the infrastructure side the global build out is still in the early innings and we expect test demand to ebb and flow as the network build out moves through various geographies. Memory test is another bright story. Revenues were up 76% from Q1 2019. The LPDDR5 ramp on our Magnum epic test system was the highlight of the quarter, as DRAM Final Test is a new and promising segment for us. We expect that ramp to continue in second quarter. From a revenue perspective though, flash test shipments were the dominant controller in the quarter. The latest protocol interface standards in flash are pushing interface speeds higher, driving a refresh of packaged test systems. We expect this trend to also continue in the second quarter.  Additionally, we saw healthy shipments for indigenous Chinese memory production in the first quarter. In the system test group sales doubled from the first quarter of 2019, with storage tests standing out with sales of over $75 million in the quarter. This was more than three times the level of a year ago quarter as demand for both HDD and system level test remains strong. Our defense and aerospace business grew over 30% in the quarter year-on-year, while production board tests softened on slower automotive electronics demand. In wireless test light point sales were up 50% year-on-year on increased demand for both connectivity and cellular related test systems. Like semi test light point shipments are building foundational capacity for 5G handset tests and benefiting from the Wi-Fi fixed transition.  Shifting to industrial automation, revenue in Q1 was down about 10% year-on-year as the improving outlook for universal robots in Asia, which we saw in Q4, was stopped dead in its tracks by the COVID-19 pandemic in Q1. In Europe and North America UR also faced increasing headwinds as the quarter progressed. On the other hand, MiR's autonomous mobile robots delivered roughly flat sales in the quarter compared with a year ago period. We believe the opportunities for automation will accelerate post pandemic as businesses see the resilience benefit of a more automated workflow. There will also be the opportunity in the likely realignment of localized manufacturing of critical supplies and a heavy reliance on warehouse automation and logistics automation.  To that end, our investment in new products, distribution, and organizational capability continues at full speed. In March, we introduced the MiR250 Autonomous Mobile Robot and the AutoGuide MaxN10 Pallet Stacking autonomous forklift. In April, Universal Robots formally introduced the market's most capable industrial bin picking product ActiNav. ActiNav is a UR Plus application that uses 3D vision and a proprietary path planning software in an easy to deploy plug and play solution. It provides the necessary hand-eye coordination to both precisely pick parts from bins and precisely place parts in a manufacturing flow.  Finally, let's jump up and look at the big picture. Our 1Q demand was very strong and we were nimble enough to fulfill that demand despite the COVID-19 challenges. Our Q2 demand looks even stronger and the team is focused on knocking down supply bottlenecks to realize another great quarter. However, we recognize that we're not operating in a vacuum. The midterm impact of rolling economic shutdowns remains uncertain in many industries, including our own. Bear in mind that volatility is not new to us. We have an operating model that can flex up and down with extreme demand swings and still remain profitable. We have employees across the company that have weathered severe economic storms in the past and in each case we've emerged better positioned competitively.  You will note that we have suspended our stock buyback as a prudent hedge until the future impact becomes a bit clear. At the same time, we also anticipate an increased likelihood of M&A opportunities later in the year. Either way, our rock solid balance sheet will be an asset in the quarters to come. Longer term, we know technology relentlessly marches onward providing solutions to global challenges and enriching all of our lives. We remain confident in the long-term outlook for our test and automation markets and in our strategy to excel at serving them. Sanjay will now take you through the financial details. Sanjay. Okay, there's a lot in there. But, I think it is perhaps a little bit incoherent to see such strong tester demand when people are talking about the uncertainty or declining in unit volumes, particularly in handsets. But I think this is not unprecedented. This is back to the issue of it's not so much the number of phones that are being produced, it's the complexity of the silicon in the phones and the associated test time. And that's obviously and absolutely what's occurring at the moment. So whether we were in the midst of a COVID pandemic or not, the business right now would be equally robust. And I don't believe it's overbuying or sort of there's a rationalization necessarily provided this economic impact doesn't persist into next year and slow down the rate of complexity growth, which is a possibility. We don't know if that will happen, but it's a possibility. But I think with so many things coming together this year around features in phones like the new Wi-Fi standard, some of the new sensor technologies, and of course 5G, that it's just driving a lot of complexity increase. And so I don't think the test business, you can necessarily correlate that well with the end markets for semiconductors because of that. You certainly see automotive down, way down. And we see that in our business industrial down and we see that in our business for test. But mobility is quite strong. Yeah, I think it's reasonably analogous. And therefore, year-to-year, what you've seen in our business for test is that it's not monotonic or consistent year-to-year in terms of our business in the second and third quarter related to mobility. In the years where there's a lot of technological change, we get incrementally more growth in revenue. And then there's some years where the change is more modest and it'll be down. So that's going to be part of our future, as far as the eye can see. So we really look at it as a trend line and, yes, this is a particularly strong year. It certainly could be. I think what we've seen since the January call is that what we described as sort of the first and second quarters being roughly equal is close to right. I think we've seen a little more strengthening in the second quarter than we projected back then. And we've seen Q1 turn out to be a little bit higher at the high end of our guide than back then. So it's come in a little bit hotter and therefore, it certainly could be that the percentage skew toward the first half could be higher. The thing about the second half though it's not a -- there is no model out there we can rely on to predict what's going to happen. So, at the moment the demand, even the backlog and the deliveries we're quoting through the third quarter are pretty strong, but we know that can change in a moment's notice. Yeah, so I think first of all, it's a good question. Most of the test capacity that is being installed in second and third quarter is for production of handsets that will occur in third, fourth quarter of this year. So the falloff in handsets that we've seen in Q1 and Q2, there is no relationship on that demand. It's related to what do people think, the unit volume for new phones, not in aggregate, but for new phones will be in the second half of the year. And apparently going just by the strength in the business that view is still pretty robust. The other thing that changes as you go from January till now is people start to get a better sense of the complexity impact on test time. So there's some preliminary views back in January but as you get closer to mass production, the reality of what that test time is sets in and can drive up or down demand.  We saw several years ago if you remember a situation where the progression from January to April resulted in a reduction of test capacity because test time turned out to be better than people thought. In this particular situation that's not the case, it's moving a bit in the other direction. So those are the two things I think that are going on that are causing demand to be incrementally stronger despite the fact that in the first half the old handsets unit volumes are down. And then on China versus anyplace else, we're seeing very strong demand across the board. It's not one geography, it's Korea, it's China, it's U.S., it's just a generally competitive robust plan around new technology for phones. I don't want to talk about any specific customer situation. All I would say is that there's really been no change in demand from the China region for SoC test since the January call. We've had a little bit of incremental demand maybe on the memory side but things are playing out pretty much as planned on test equipment for China. Light Point may also have seen a little bit up but nothing material. Yeah. So, I think certainly people are beginning to ramp production now of Millimeter Wave, but it's in a small fraction of the handsets that'll be produced this year in the end. And, related to the impact this year, I bound it's somewhere in the high tens of millions of dollars across the company, somewhere in that sort of range. Now, we've said longer-term the total 5G wave should build towards sort of this $400 million to $500 million added to the TAM. And with everything going on right now with sub 6G and with Millimeter Wave and such, maybe we are two thirds of the way into that because we are seeing strong demand for the sub 6G side of this. It's just less test intensive. So, as we go into 2021 I would expect that to grow. And I think those are the sort of bookends. Yeah. On the direct sales part, that's a program we launched last year and it's something we're doing both in all three of our automation companies that started out heavily distribution oriented. For large accounts MiR UR have moved towards direct sales, but that's really been in effect for a couple of quarters. We're into a downturn now and a lot of those customers were automotive related. So I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I don't think the revenue percentage would be all that significant at this point. On inventory I don't think there's very much of any buildup inventory in the channel around automation. It's a very quick turns business. We look at that pretty carefully every quarter so no overhang there. Yeah, I think the conversations today are really not that far out in terms of their headlights, but it's an expectation. But I would say that we've commented that the mobile platform hit near, saw a flat sales quarter-over-quarter, hasn't been as robustly impacted by this pandemic. And part of the reason for that is that there's already applications for that platform in the healthcare space that are growing. So while industrial has been moving down, that's been increasing. And so I think there's partly small to medium sized enterprises will look at automation coming out of this as an -- as a strategic asset. But moving toward some of these other verticals that are likely to disproportionately grow is another part of the calculus on how this growth in industrial automation accelerates coming out of this. You know, I think that's something we're concerned about and to the extent we've checked and looked. We don't see that really. You know, it would be pretty obvious if we saw customers that are trying to test silicon shift or move capacity to an OSATs but typically speaking, the testers are purchased by third party OSAT and they're not very willing to invest in capital unless it's going to be utilized really quickly. And as we've looked at the utilization of the equipment that we've been installing, it seems to be pulled quickly and turned on and utilized right away. So there's not idle capacity being put into the test, semi test channel that we're aware of. Yeah, for the back half of the year God knows. But, there are a couple of things going on there that are interesting. One piece of it is that we opened up a new segment of memory tests that we haven't participated in before, which is DRAM final test. And in the DRAM world there's a transition occurring to LPDDR5. That obsoletes the existing fleet of equipment out there. So to the extent memory manufacturers are beginning that shift just from a technological point of view, they have no choice but to buy incremental capacity for it and that's something that's benefiting us in Q1. And likely we will continue through the year, not just Q2 but in beyond. And that has years to go. So that's a tailwind for sure.  The bigger piece of memory in terms of revenue is flash and flashes for many years now have been undergoing a similar generational shift towards high speed. And unlike I would say DRAM, that's kind of very controlled and not -- I wouldn't say a commodity, but the standards around DRAM are kind of ubiquitous. In the case of flash, there is much more bespoke design going on around the protocols for the interface speeds depending on the handset they're going in or the application they're going in. And that diversity drives a lot of incremental test instrument buying to test all that variety. So that's been true historically. It is just as strong right now. And then the other comment I'll make is that new manufacturers that we see coming online in China are not slowing down. They are putting capacity in and that's also a tailwind. Yeah. So, hard drives have been a standout and both aspects of what we do with that storage test product are interesting. And I think the hard drive piece is sustainable and it's sustainable pretty much as far as the eye can reasonably see and through next year. And this has been going on for several years now. And, there's only really two predominant manufacturers out there. And so share is a little bit not an issue as much as just as the systemic underlying growth there. And it definitely seems to be there with the increasing density of these drives and volume. On the system level test side, that's a nascent market that's still in early development. It's a semiconductor test market. It's an additional insertion of test for semiconductor tests. And very few manufacturers have adopted that methodology yet. We're fortunately on the leading edge of that adoption. Will it become an industry pervasive methodology where more and more manufacturers decide to add an additional insertion or test step before they ship their final product or not is unclear but compared to what our expectations were a year ago the volume there is certainly exceeded our expectations. So it's a good secular sign. It's on the table for sure whether it'll happen or not is a question. I mean fourth quarter is always strong. And the early signs in China, you know, China certainly was an anchor in Q1 on our IA sales but as we've gone into March and into Q2 they've come back pretty strong in IA buying. It could very well set year-over-year records in our IA business. So if that is a mirror image of the rest of the world which we don't know we can certainly see a Q4 in IA that was sequentially up. Yeah, I would kind of toss all that overboard unfortunately because we just don't know about the second half. But what I can say is if what we do know about is the first half of the year and if you look at the first half of the year we're running towards the high end in market size in both memory and SoC compared to what we projected that led to the prior estimates. So, if anything -- if this had been a sort of normal year without COVID we probably right now be revising up some of our market size estimates for the year for each segment. But in light of what's happening we really can't comment. Yeah, I think it's just very speculative but I'll give you maybe just a little bit of color and I'll probably regret it. If you go back to what happened in 2008 and 2009 as a reference, it came back with a vengeance in 2010 and you could argue that it sort of on a trend line basis still the hole in that was created in 2009. So the technological progress just drives a underlying test demand in terms of this complexity growth that is cumulative. It can be temporarily squashed through things like a sharp drop in unit volume demand which is what occurred there. But it came back with a vengeance. So the real question then in this situation is when will the unit volume demand recover because the underlying technological growth will likely continue unabated. And I think that's everybody's guess. We expect things, mobility in handsets have been slightly declining now for a couple of years and it's really had little impact on the test demand. If the handset market starts into double-digit declines and that persist through next year I would say it must have some impact on Testament because the complexity underlying complexity growth this year is quite high. It's likely that it'll oscillate year-to-year. So those are just sort of touchstones but no prediction."

            "name": "Sanjay Mehta",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Good morning everyone. This morning I'll provide details on how we're managing our operations, spending and capital allocation in this uncertain environment. I will then cover our Q1 results and our Q2 outlook. I first want to acknowledge the tough environment our employees, customers, suppliers and their families are going through. For those that have family or friends with COVID-19, I wish you a speedy recovery and hope this pandemic will be behind us soon. I would like to thank our employees and suppliers for your extraordinary efforts and our customers for your patience and confidence in Teradyne.  As Mark noted earlier, our priorities are the safety of our employees, supporting our customers, and continued execution in achieving our financial objectives. While we can't predict the duration of this pandemic and its economic consequences, we enter this pandemic in a strong financial position with a flexible business model. Specifically, we have 905 million of cash and marketable securities at the end of Q1 with no short-term debt. We have a $460 million face value convertible bond that's due in December 2023. We have a diverse portfolio of businesses in test and industrial automation. These businesses continue to service their markets with a leading set of products. Our test businesses continue to have tailwinds behind them with new technology introductions, introductions like various flavors of 5G, and new memory standards like LPDDR5. This is balanced by the contraction of our industrial automation businesses due to both weaknesses in the auto industry and COVID-19.  A couple of points on our expense model, the test equipment market is cyclical, hence we've structured our company's expenses to be able to handle large demand swings. Total expenses are set at a level to ensure we generate cash during periods of low market demand while retaining maximum flexibility to scale up. For example, manufacturing for our test portfolios mainly outsourced to contract manufacturers. Therefore, much of our cost of goods sold are flexible as we are not burdened with the extensive fixed costs. We have an efficient operating expense model where portions of our engineering, operations, and G&A functions are in low cost regions. Lastly, our compensation structure varies with our revenue and profit levels.  As Mark noted, we are continuing to invest in our engineering roadmaps across the company. This includes significant 5G, AI, and memory related investments in test. We're also investing to support the pullout of our UR Plus application kits, including our ActiNav industrial bin picking product just introduced by Universal Robots, a new product roadmaps at MiR and AutoGuide as well as key IP that will benefit us in the years to come. Another key investment focus this year will be our supply line. While the bulk of our production is in Asia close to our customers, the supply line supporting that production is truly global. As Q1 demonstrated, our internal team and partners did an outstanding job in difficult circumstances to meet our customer delivery requirements. This experience has not only reinforced the value of our operations team, but has identified areas that we could improve. These are primarily in areas of adding redundancy for critical components and manufacturing capacity. We're taking these lessons learned to strengthen the supply chain further in the days ahead, and these will have an impact on our costs.  Now to Q1, company revenues were 704 million, up 43% year-over-year. Semi test revenue of 484 million was up over 40% from Q1 of 2019 driven by handset related SoC demand and strengthened flash final test. In memory, we also ramped LPDDR5 revenues tied to our Q4 design win. System test group had revenue of $116 million which doubled year-over-year driven by strong -- driven by storage test solutions primarily for terabyte [ph] class near line drives as system tests -- as well as system tests solutions. Industrial automation or IA revenue of $60 million was down year-over-year on manufacturing weakness amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic. In March, we did see some improvement in China, our fastest growing market in 2019, which is an encouraging sign and hopefully a leading indicator for countries to get back towards pre-COVID-19 work environments. Light Point had revenue of $43 million and grew 50% year-over-year with cellular 5G and the new connectivity standard Wi-Fi 6 driving revenue.  Non-GAAP gross margins were 57.6%, down a point quarter-over-quarter due to product mix. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were down $7 million to $197 million from the fourth quarter due to lower discretionary spending and timing of expenditures, slightly offset by higher variable compensation on higher profit. Non-GAAP operating profit rate was 30% and non-GAAP EPS was a dollar. The tax rate excluding discrete items for the quarter and year was 14.5% on a GAAP basis and 15% on a non-GAAP basis. The improvement in tax rate is driven by a higher revenue mix from our test portfolio than planned.  Turning to share buybacks, we bought back 1.3 million shares for $79 million at an average price of $58.81 in the first quarter. Effective April 1st, we have suspended our share repurchase program. There are two reasons why we made the decision to preserve cash at this time. Firstly, as we look forward there is uncertainty of the depth and the duration of the economic impact of COVID-19. Secondly, we wanted to retain more cash on the balance sheet to enable M&A opportunities which may present themselves in the near-term. As Q1 is typically our lowest cash generation quarter we generated $6 million in free cash flow as we paid annual variable compensation in Q1. Share buybacks and dividends were primary drivers of our $111 million of cash decline in Q1.  Turning to Q2, given the volatile environment -- Turning to Q2 revenue range, sorry, given the volatile environment that we're facing we've widened our guidance range to reflect the various scenarios we're considering. The first assumption is that second or third waves of the virus do not force countries to shut down essential semiconductor businesses. The second assumption is that semiconductors retain the status of being considered essential by governments when imposing stay at home work orders. The third assumption is that our operations team continues to be able to mitigate supply chain and production issues globally.  From a demand perspective I would also like to remind you of a couple of important points. First, we have a concentrated demand in Q2 related to Smartphone handsets and their associated launches. As you know, Smartphone demand can change quickly and while our guidance reflects our latest estimates, we're not immune to the short-term changes in demand that could materially change our outlook for Q2. Second, we're not operating in normal conditions, so normal seasonality may not come into play in the future quarters.  Now to our Q2 outlook, sales are expected to be between $690 million and $800 million. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.86 to a $1.16 on 173 million of diluted shares. Second quarter guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles and the non-cash computed interest on the convertible debt. Second quarter gross margins are estimated at 55% to 56% down approximately 2% at the midpoint from Q1. There are two factors causing the margin decline. First, incremental costs associated with COVID-19 are being incurred to ensure our supply line as noted prior. This impact results in just under half of the margin decline. Second, increased mix of mobility business in the quarter drives just over half of the margin decline.  Margins expected in Q2 follows similar historical pattern when there is a sales mix bias towards mobility. Second half of 2020 gross margins are expected to further decline from Q2 due to continued growth in new product ramps which have not come down the cost curve such as the UltraFLEX Plus and Millimeter Wave solutions. We expect to return to our historical gross margins in 2021. OPEX spending will increase from the first quarter due to incremental test investments in both R&D and SG&A. Incremental IA investments were focused on distribution and product development investments. OPEX is expected to run at 27% to 30% of second quarter sales. The non-GAAP operating profit at the midpoint of our second quarter guidance is 27%. Regarding our OPEX plans for the full year, in light of the changes we discussed earlier, our latest estimate projects 2020 OPEX to grow about 7% to 8% from $758 million in 2019. This is down from our January guide.  In closing, these are challenging times and we believe we are well-positioned to execute over the period of demand volatility. We have a diversified portfolio of businesses and customers, strong cash position and balance sheet, taking actions to reinforce our business against an uncertain future while continuing to strategically invest in customer support and product roadmaps that will power our future success. As we proceed ahead we'll make changes if needed in line with the foundational [Technical Difficulty] noted. When this pandemic and resulting societal impacts recede we're confident that the global economic and demographic forces will continue to make the electronics test and industrial automation industries attractive growth markets. With that, I'll turn things back to Andy. Yeah, hey buddy, it's Sanjay here. So, I think that we have an active M&A group that we've look at many different opportunities in the last several years. Obviously, the focus has been on industrial automation, but we are actively looking and the key part of that strategy is that as valuations potentially come down in the future, products -- or companies have a good fit and become more attractive financially. And so I'd say, historically and even looking forward there'll be a focus on industrial automation. But I wouldn't count anything now. Sure, so going down about 2% from Q1 is at the midpoint is what I said and really half -- think about it, over half of the decline is tied to the concentration of sales mix and mobility. That's not unlike the patterns we've seen in the past. The second part would be and I mentioned in my prepared remarks we've had to strengthen our supply chain and many costs associated with the COVID-19 impact which is just under half of the impact. So that really kind of bridges you from Q1 to Q2. And then getting on to your second question about the second half, first let me comment and say the second half there's tremendous demand uncertainty. As you'd expect with different businesses we have we could have -- could come in or not come in so that product mix would have an impact. But that being said we're really seeing the adoption of several new products and solutions specifically the UltraFLEX Plus platform and Millimeter Wave really take hold and volumes ramping a little bit faster than we had predicted. And these are platforms if you recall that last over 10 years and in their infancy stage they come down a cost curve. And so -- and we do expect margins to come back in 2021. Yes, so I think industrial automation had some weakness building up to COVID-19 in the auto industry which is a large part of the business. And with the rolling shutdowns in manufacturing in the U.S. and Europe are predominantly big regions for the business. We're seeing that impact and obviously contract year-on-year. We did see some encouraging demand in China in the last couple of weeks of March as well as April to date. We are seeing demand pick up back to pre-COVID levels and it's an encouraging sign as an indicator of how things might return back to normal. But we're still in the early innings on that.  When I think about the business, we guided 10% to 12% OPEX growth in 2020 and we brought that down to 7% to 8%. A lot of that investment decline was really tied to the go to market for industrial automation that we've kept the focus on the product, the ecosystem, etc. But really we had an investment strategy that one, tied to investing for growth. And as the contraction and the uncertainty remains, we've moderated that spend in our plans to come down. But we believe in the fundamentals in the long run and we will as the market comes back and manufacturing comes back, we actually think COVID-19 if ever there's a hope there's a benefit out of it is to highlight the advantages and strengthening your supply chain with industrial automation. Now, this would need to be balanced by getting people back to work. But we will continue to invest in the ecosystem as well as distribution. It's just in 2020, it'll be a little bit less than we anticipated, just given the moderated revenue we're seeing. Yeah hi, it's Sanjay here. So, from a supply chain perspective I think we've -- our operations team and our supply partners have done yeoman's effort. And if we break it down, when this first -- pandemic first broke out in China, where we have a large contract manufacturer as well as supply chain kind of feeding it specifically, we drove a path or a task force on ensuring to get labor back, ensuring to get materials. And then the first thing we did is we kicked off our supply chain in other parts of the world. And we invested in redundancy from different supply lines into different geographic locations. And so the key takeaway is that we are building both redundancy in the component qualification that feeds our test equipment and industrial automation products and then secondly, in building capacity in different territories. And then as the pandemic grew throughout the world and as you mentioned, Malaysia, the Philippines and different South Asian countries, you had to build redundancy in logistics and the flight lines to both -- for our products to get to customers, but also for our components to actually get to the contract manufacturers to get deployed.  So there's been a significant investment that we're going to strengthen our supply chain and make sure we have clear diversification of supply if in the event the pandemic, which who knows how long it's going to go, will have that strength. And so that's I think part one. And the second thing is we are building obviously our inventories went down just really to kind of meet our demand. And as we're growing, we are currently building inventory in anticipation of delivering, as you saw, the significant range. And, the range is really tied to where do we believe where we can have a high assurance of delivery of that. So we are building inventory at this time. But I think it'll normalize as demand starts to shake out and as the market unfolds. Yeah, so I think at the beginning of the year we anticipated a strong first half. It's kind of playing out the way we anticipated it. It is a little bit stronger in Q2 as we've guided in our range. The second half of the year is really opaque. The impact of the economic construction of the pandemic is really unclear at this point. We do know that there has been, relative to our expectations in January, a little bit more of an acceleration of adoption of the UltraFLEX Plus and Millimeter Wave and as I said earlier, given the volatility in the second half, there could be a bunch of puts and takes in the gross margin. With regards to the ramp up of the UltraFLEX, the UltraFLEX has been around for decades and has a long tail. So we don't necessarily see a huge obsolescence risk with the transition as it occurs. Yeah, so Sanjay here. So, first of all, we don't comment on specific customers. We obviously did disclose in the annual report that ValveA [ph] and affiliates did procure 11% of our business last year, but we specifically won't comment. We did have one 10% customer this quarter. I think from a mix perspective I will comment on the specific numbers, but semi testers will -- as you said will be very strong. And as we've messaged as part of mobility, we do expect system test to decline a tad or to decline. Yeah hi, it is Sanjay here. So, first thing with IA, as we enter into this market we believe that it's on a rapid growth trajectory over the mid-term. We're seeing the impact obviously of the auto weakness in the pandemic but inherently in that our fixed cost as a percentage of the businesses is much higher because we do internal manufacturing. And so we do outsource some subcomponents but fundamentally we inherently have a higher fixed cost structure just because we believe we have a leadership position and that's one of our attributes to hold on to that leadership position. So there is a higher fixed cost component.  The second comment is in 2019 we were profitable, we had plans even though it was a heavy investment year that we've kind of redacted down tied to revenue. We believe we would have a profitable year. In the first quarter with the contraction we weren't profitable. Yeah, so it is Sanjay here. So, really we're predicting a downward bias in Q2 just given the fact that there's a lot of filter in place, manufacturing locations are still down. And so we do see a further contraction. Looking forward as I said earlier we did see signs of improvement what I would call getting back to an initial innings in China pre-COVID levels but it's really too early to tell how fast the recovery would be. And we did enter it -- we did enter in the last quarter a little bit of weakness with automotive."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference may be recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your host today, Andy Blanchard, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please, go ahead.\nAndy Blanchard: Thank you, Michelle. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our discussion of Teradyne's most recent financial results. I'm joined this morning by our CEO, Mark Jagiela and our CFO, Sanjay Mehta. Following our opening remarks, we'll provide details of our performance for 2021's fourth quarter and full year, along with our outlook for the first quarter of 2022. The press release containing our fourth quarter results was issued last evening. We're providing slides on the Investor page of the website that may be helpful to you in following the discussion. Replays of this call will be available via the same page after the call ends. The matters that we discuss today will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause Teradyne's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release, as well as our most recent SEC filings. Additionally, those forward-looking statements are made as of today, and we make no obligation to update them as a result of developments occurring after this call. During today's call, we'll make reference to non-GAAP financial measures. We've posted additional information concerning these non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure where available on the Investor page of our website. Looking ahead between now and our next earnings call, Teradyne will be participating in technology or industrial-focused investor conferences hosted by Citi, Morgan Stanley and Susquehanna. Now let's get on with the rest of the agenda. First, Mark will comment on our recent results and the market conditions as we enter the New Year. Sanjay will then offer more details on our results along with our guidance for the first quarter. We'll then answer your questions, and this call is scheduled for one hour. Mark?\nMark Jagiela: Good morning and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll summarize 2001's [ph] fourth quarter and the full year and then comment on our early view of 2022. Sanjay will then provide the financial details and review our updated earnings model and capital allocation plans. While we forecast 2022 to be another solid year for Teradyne, overall sales will likely decline in the first half, as we believe SOC test sales will be impacted by modest complexity growth in our largest market, as the jump to 3-nanometer production is pushed to 2023. More on that in a minute. Recapping 2021. We finished the year strong, bringing full year sales, non-GAAP earnings growth to 19% and sales growth to -- sorry, the sales growth of 19% and GAAP earnings growth to 29%, respectively. 2021's performance was a result of broad-based growth across our Test and IA businesses. SemiTest sales grew about 17%, with our UltraFLEX family contributing to the expansion into the compute sector and Eagle product lines serving the automotive and analog industrial sectors, growing nearly 90%. For 2021, we estimate the SOC market was about $4.8 billion, up from $3.6 billion in 2020, which puts our market share at about 46% for the year. The memory market in 2021 was about flat with 2020 at approximately $1 billion. Our Magnum family continues to shine in the NAND segment, and we're reinforcing our position in the DRAM segment, as the industry prepares for LPDDR5 and DDR5 ramps in 2022 and beyond. Our share remains at about 40%. LitePoint's wireless test business had a great year, growing 25% from 2020. The global demand for connecting and tracking, just about everything, machines, materials and people is nearly insatiable. LitePoint is well aligned to this trend with products that simplify testing of the expanding range of wireless standards. Whether in networking with WiFi 6E and 7, in location tracking with ultra wideband and cellular with 5G or numerous other standards, the rate of technology change continues unabated, which is great for our business. Moving to our Industrial Automation business. At UR, sales were up 41% from 2020. We continue to expand the number of UR+ partners and certified plug-and-play apps with assembly, machine tending and palletizing among the most popular of the more than 375 available apps. We also continue to broaden our reach beyond existing markets, often with OEM partners. One exceptional example is our expansion into welding applications, where we finished the year with a growth of more than 3x above 2020 levels. Welding applications now account for more than 6% of UR sales. At MiR, full year sales grew 42% from 2020 on the strength of our new higher payload MiR250, 600 and 1,350 kilogram AMRs. It's also notable that the value of MiR AMRs with advanced fleet management software is amplified as the size of the robot fleet grows. We saw this play out last year with large account sales, those with the potential to deploy hundreds of units, growing nearly 50% faster than the installed base at large. Looking ahead to 2022, the long-term drivers that power our growth in Test and Industrial Automation are strong. In fact, as you will hear from Sanjay, our updated 2024 earnings model reflects an expected higher growth in sales and profits for both areas. However in 2022, while we expect our IA business to power along with 35% plus growth, we see our SOC business likely contracting during the year as the shift to 3-nanometer volume production is pushed to 2023. You can begin to see some of this effect in our 1Q guidance as we usually see the beginnings of our summer ramp in March. We expect 2Q to show similar effects as it's usually our peak tooling period for our largest market. As a result, we are modeling first half sales down 15% to 20%. We don't expect the impact of this to extend into second half. We expect demand to accelerate again in 2023 as we begin to see the complexity growth related to investments for 3-nanometer, gate-all-around and advanced packaging. Overall, we expect the 2022 SOC market to be similar in size to 2021 at approximately $4.6 billion to $5 billion. Shifting to memory test. We expect the market in 2022 to be in the $900 million to $1.1 billion range with a midpoint that's similar to 2021. We expect spending will be weighted toward DRAM as LPDDR5 adoption expands and DDR5 for server applications ramp. In the past, a shift to spending in DRAM would be a significant headwind for us, but we expect we'll maintain our share at about 40% in 2022 as our Magnum EPIC DRAM tester grows in market popularity. In System Test, after 5 years of high growth driven by the Storage Test product line, we expect 2022 to be a digestion year with sales softening slightly. Wireless Test at LitePoint, however is expected to fill that revenue gap, so we expect the combined System Test and Wireless Test will be about flat with 2021. Shifting from Test to Industrial Automation. Our business outlook is brighter than ever. As I noted in our last call, the penetration rate of both collaborative robots and autonomous mobile robots is under 3%. The economic environment is favorable with worker shortages, the movement of production capacity closer to end markets and a relentless drive for higher quality and safer operations, all helping to drive demand. The opportunity in front of us is immense, and we are investing to exploit it to the fullest. At the IA segment level, we've increased our long-term revenue growth rate and expect our sales in 2022 to grow more than 35% off of 2021. Sanjay will provide the long-term modeling details, but the key point is the investments we've made and will continue to make position us for both short- and long-term success in this expanding market. Expanding OEM relationships and served markets is a key part of our strategy. Like the welding initiative that is bearing fruit, we have several others in flight. One example is in e-commerce. One of our partners, Nimble Robotics, uses AI, unique grippers and clever software on our UR cobot platform to pick consumer goods and high-volume warehouse operations for numerous national brands. You may have seen the recent Wall Street Journal article complete with photos of the solution in action. Their innovative solution, dubbed goods to robot, complements automated storage and retrieval systems widely used in e-commerce. Our cobot ease of use and durability are a natural for this application. Well over 15 million items across 500,000 unique products have been picked to date as Nimble executes an ambitious growth plan in the e-commerce space. Another driver of growth in IA has been the growing use of UR cobots to improve the competitiveness of local manufacturing to support reshoring of production. Pantech, a Finnish maker of high-quality ceramics is a good example. They've added automation to allow skilled craftspeople to focus on high-volume and high-value tasks. While UR cobots do the repetitive and physically demanding ones, such as glazing and finishing of ceramics. To summarize, 2021 was another year of impressive growth at Teradyne and caps a five-year stretch where sales and non-GAAP earnings have grown at a compounded rate of 16% and 32%, respectively. As we've said before, we've managed the business to a trend line model. Our updated 2024 earnings model shows improved growth trend lines reflecting our increasing confidence in the business. These projections are not hockey sticks. They are consistent with our past performance and correlated to investment trends in semiconductor automation market drivers. Along the way, we expect some years will perform above the trend line and other years below. In Test, 2020 and 2021 were above trend line years, while 2022 will likely be below. These year-to-year swings in customer buying patterns are a part of our market dynamics. Our underlying business model with outsourced manufacturing and test is designed to efficiently absorb these dynamics. Also, our good and improving gross margins give us increasing leverage within this dynamic. The growth in volume and complexity of semiconductors that propels the test market is stronger than ever. Our Industrial Automation portfolio is well positioned against macro trends and back to high growth. All these dynamics should net out to attractive mid-term growth of both sales and earnings. With that, I turn it over to Sanjay for more details. Sanjay?\nSanjay Mehta: Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover the financial highlights of Q4 and review the financial details of 2021. Looking forward, I'll provide our Q1 outlook and update our mid-term earnings model and our capital allocation plans. Now to Q4. Revenues were $885 million, and we delivered a non-GAAP operating profit of 31% and EPS of $1.37.Semi Test revenue of $592 million was strong across the board with notable demand for apps processor and RF test in SOC and higher speed flash test in memory. System Test group had revenue of $127 million, up 23% year-over-year, driven by higher sales in Storage Test and defense and aerospace. LitePoint revenue of $52 million was up over 31% and from the year-ago period on WiFi 6E and early WiFi 7 test demand. Industrial Automation revenue of $113 million was up 23% from the fourth quarter of last year on strong demand at both UR and MiR. Non-GAAP gross margins were 59.5%, on plan and down quarter-over-quarter due to lower volume and product mix. You'll see our non-GAAP operating expenses were up $11 million to $253 million from the third quarter due primarily to ongoing industrial automation investments. We generated $302 million in free cash in the fourth quarter. The non-GAAP tax rate, excluding discrete items for the quarter, was 13.6% and on a GAAP basis was 14.75%. For the full year, it was 14.5% on a non-GAAP basis and 14.75% on a GAAP basis. We ended the year with cash and marketable securities of $1.5 billion. Regarding debt to-date, $343 million of our convertible bond has been redeemed early and repaid. We have a remaining face value of $117 million. Turning to the full year results of 2021. The Teradyne revenues of $3.7 billion grew $581 million or 19% year-over-year. $485 million of the growth was from our Test portfolio, while IA delivered $96 million of growth. We had one customer that directly or indirectly drove approximately 19% of our revenue in 2021. Gross margins for the year were 59.6% and operating profit was 33%, up from 57.2% and 30%, respectively, in 2020. Non-GAAP EPS was $5.98, a 29% increase over 2020. We generated $966 million in free cash in 2021 and returned $666 million through share repurchases and dividends. Looking more closely at the components of 2021 revenue growth. As Mark outlined, SOC test revenues grew $371 million or 20% on strength in all market segments, but with particular growth in the compute, industrial and automotive markets. In memory, revenues were $396 million, up 3%. NAND test demand drove the growth in 2021. In System Test sales, sales grew for the fifth consecutive year to $468 million, up 14% from 2020. All subsegments of System Test grew in 2021 with Storage Test delivering the largest increase moving from $242 million in 2020 to $288 million in 2021. LitePoint is also on an impressive growth path. Sales increased to $217 million, 25% above 2020 and has grown at an 18% CAGR since 2016. Growth drivers included the production ramp of WiFi 6E, WiFi 7 engineering systems and UWB expansion. It's notable that UWB is early in its market penetration and we expect a long-term growth trajectory as new applications for this technology emerge. In 2021, IA revenue was $376 million, up 34% from 2020's $280 million level. UR grew 41% to $311 million, while MiR grew 42% to $64 million. AutoGuide sales were under $2 million in 2021 as we continue to reposition that group for sustainable long-term growth. In 2021, we managed through numerous supply constraints at UR and MiR without a material impact on sales. We expect those constraints to become more severe and expect they may impact the timing of some shipments in the first half of 2022. We've considered that in our guidance. Now to our outlook for Q1. Sales are expected to be between $700 million and $770 million. Non-GAAP EPS range of $0.76 to $0.98 on 175 million diluted shares. First quarter guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles and a non-cash imputed interest on the convertible debt. First quarter gross margins are estimated at 58.5% and 59.5%, first quarter OpEx at 33% to 36% of first quarter sales. The non-GAAP operating profit rate at the midpoint of our first quarter guidance is 24%. Looking at 2022. Our first half 2022 outlook is down from 2021. This will be felt in the first and second quarters with expected Q2 company sales to be about 25% lower than Q2 2021 levels. Regarding our OpEx plans for 2022. OpEx growth of 11% to 13% is expected with the majority of the incremental growth in IA. This will likely put our OpEx above model in 2022 before coming back to model in 2023. The OpEx investment this year is targeted at R&D to improve ease of use, broaden our robot product lines and strengthen our go-to-market capabilities, all in support of long-term sales and earnings growth. Turning to capital expenditures. We expect CapEx to be approximately $160 million. For 2022, our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate is estimated at 15% based on current tax laws. Moving to our earnings model. We expect test and IA growth will drive 2024 company revenue to $4.9 billion and non-GAAP EPS to $8 at the midpoint of our updated model. Gross margin is estimated at 59% to 60%, a 100 basis point increase from the prior model and is based on product mix and operating leverage from higher revenue. OpEx as a percent of sales will decline to 26% to 28%, and non-GAAP operating margin expected will be 31% to 34%. The model assumes current tax laws. As shown on the supporting slide, the new model is in line with the trend line performance. Now let me provide a little color. With 2021 non-GAAP EPS of $5.98, we've achieved our previous 2024 earnings model three years early on the strength of our test businesses. As we've done in the past, when building our earnings model, we consider the year-on-year demand swings that occur in both test and IA, but we evaluate our growth on a trend line versus any specific year. Therefore, as in past models, we use the average of 2020 and 2021 revenue as the baseline for our projections. From that baseline, we expect test revenue to grow at 7% to 11% compounded and IA revenues to grow 32% to 45% through 2024. Both growth rates are significant increases, both in absolute and relative terms from our earlier model. In SemiTest, we expect long-term growth will be driven by the steady increase in device complexity across our businesses along with high single-digit semiconductor unit growth. The transition to 3-nanometer and gate all-round technologies will drive complexity growth and higher transistor densities, increased test data collection for process yield learning and longer test times. The complexity point is illustrated by looking at the recent market size trends. When taking an average of 2018 and 2019, the ATE market size was approximately $4 billion. In '21 and '22, the average will be approximately $6 billion. Our earnings model assumes continued growth in the ATE market, and we believe WFE CapEx is a leading indicator of future test demand. This capacity is being put in place to service favorable semiconductor end market trends. First, the compute market is benefiting from the growth of both x86 and ARM-based solutions in higher-performing solutions at a faster cadence than in the past. The ARM solutions include new hyperscale applications along with AI devices for the data center and edge compute. Second, automotive market has elevated to a higher level. Increases in electric and autonomous driving are pushing the growth and complexity and number of chips per car. Third, the analog industrial end market is expected to continue to operate at a higher level as the digitalization of industry continues to broaden. In IA, we're attacking an attractive and sustainable long-term growth opportunity. The market penetration of cobots and autonomous mobile robots remains below 3%, while the range of applications they economically serve continues to expand. Our strategy is to drive penetration higher in existing markets and grow the number of new applications in new industry verticals. To enable this strategy, we continue to lean into our OpEx investments. We'll operate the IA business with a target operating margin of 5% to 15%, while we invest to drive growth and reinforce our competitive position. We don't expect the growth rate to moderate in the midterm, but at the point in the future if it does, we\u2019ll dial back the OpEx growth and expect operating margins above 20%. In 2022, we expect we'll operate towards the low end of the 5% to 15% range. Shifting to capital allocation. We'll continue our balanced strategy. This year, we'll increase our quarterly dividend by 10% to $0.11 per share in 2022. Regarding our share repurchases. In 2021, we bought back 4 million shares for $600 million at an average price of $125.74. In 2022, we expect a minimum of $750 million of repurchases, reflecting our confidence in our operating model and the end markets we serve. In summary, 2021 was a record year for sales and earnings. Our global team continued to deliver extraordinary results in a challenging environment. The team's success in balancing customer demand and business needs amidst a constantly changing collection of pandemic-induced constraints was impressive. As we look ahead, long-term growth trends in our end markets remain strong and we've updated our earning model to reflect that outlook. While we expect 2022 will be below the long-term revenue and earnings growth trend lines, we're confident in the long-term trends in our markets and our ability to thrive in them. With that, I'll turn things back to Andy.\nAndy Blanchard: Thanks, Sanjay. Michelle, we'd now like to take some questions. [Operator Instruction] Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I think it would be great if you could give us some more detail as it relates to your largest customer. Your commentary on 2021 and 19% contribution is insightful, but given your guide for 2022, you suggest that we're in a two-year digestion period. I understand the 3-nanometer, which has been known for six months, but I think expectation was for higher unit shipment for that particular customer to make up for push out in 3-nanometer, and it seems like that's not enough. And again, we go back to two-year digestion and I am wondering if you can comment on what I just said and I have a follow-up.\nA \u2013 Mark Jagiela: Sure, Mehdi. Of course, I'm not going to divulge too much about our specific customer because that wouldn't be appropriate, but I'll give you some additional color. So I wouldn't call last year a digestion period, first of all. Last year, we had tremendous growth outside of that concentration, which sort of brought their portion of our revenue from the low 20s down below 20%. So it's really growth elsewhere that drove them down a bit versus digestion. The phenomena this year is something that has been in -- whether -- we attribute it to a variety of things such as complexity growth due to unit volume. I think I don't want to comment too much about that because, again, it gets into some proprietary information. But the latest news we have is that, as we've indicated, there will be a pretty significant reduction here in the first half of the year, which is usually the big ramp of tooling for the fall launch of new products. And we've quantified that as best we can to the second half we don't see. But typically, tooling starts in March. It peaks in the second quarter and a little bit dribbles into July. So that's where we'll feel the impact.\nMehdi Hosseini: Got it. Thank you. And just a quick follow-up on IA. And Sanjay mentioned that for 2022, operating margin is target at 5% at the low end. Perhaps you can give us some color on the ROIC difference between IA and automated test. And at in the longer-term that would make a continued OpEx investment in IA attractive and perhaps maybe ROIC or some other metrics could help us to better think about the investment that you're making?\nSanjay Mehta: Yes. So hi, Mehdi, it's Sanjay. So I think the latter part of the question first. As we see revenue continue to grow and with the penetration of the market of less than 3%, we are going to continue to invest in driving competitive advantage, broaden the portfolio, go to market -- across the board in engineering and go to market to continue to capture the market share. From a profitability or leverage perspective, moving more towards the ROIC comment is, fundamentally, when the market starts to slow and growth starts to slow at some time in the future, and we haven't considered that within our mid-term, we don't see that growth moderating over the mid-term with our 32% to 45% growth. At that point is when we will lower the investment. I will comment another point on the ROIC is our gross margins in that segment are above the corporate average. So, we'll start to higher return on the invested capital when revenue starts to moderate, the growth starts to moderate. But fundamentally, we are leaning into OpEx to really capture that market.\nMehdi Hosseini: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nJohn Pitzer: Yes, good morning guys. Thanks for letting me ask my questions. Mark, last night, Advantest reported overnight, and I think it's always a little bit dangerous to compare because starting points can be different. But I think they guided kind of their view of the SOC market up about 16% this year versus yours of flat. I'm just trying to -- and it's off the same growth rate that you have for 2021. So, I guess, I'm just trying to square the circle as to whether or not I should view your guidance as being particularly conservative, or is the way you square the circle just your relative customer concentration? And I guess if you look outside your largest customer, how do you see the SOC market trends for this year?\nMark Jagiela: Yes, it's a good question. I saw those numbers, too. I think there's two phenomenas that you cited going on. I think we are a bit lower than them in terms of the annual market size guide. Part of that is due to the fact that probably what our largest concentration is doing this year is somewhat opaque to them. And so that's a factor that's probably not in their numbers. And I do think if you look at the rest of the market, excluding that high concentration of ours, there is growth this year in the market is what we expect. So, probably -- it's almost probably 50/50 that gets the difference.\nJohn Pitzer: That's helpful. And then Sanjay, just going back to Mehdi's question on the IA business. I think I of growth rate to op margin. But is there sort of a revenue level of IA where you would expect to see scale take over, or is this a business that the faster you're growing, the more you have to build out channels? I'm just kind of curious, is there a revenue level that we can expect you guys hitting in some time out in the future that's just going to drive some natural operating leverage in that business?\nSanjay Mehta: Yes. And over the mid-term, in our model, we are seeing a little bit of that play out as revenues grow. Sure, the fixed -- certain fixed costs are going to gain on that leverage. But I'd ask you to think about if -- as we grow into different verticals and the applications within those verticals, we're really building both engineering capability in our product, reducing friction in those different verticals of how we can get to reducing the time of implementation significantly. So, a significant portion is tied to R&D as well as scaling the go-to-market in different territories and in different segments. But the quick answer is, as I said earlier, there is some of that scale we are seeing in the mid-term, and we will see that come in. But I just wanted to reinforce the point that we continue -- and plan to continue to invest in broadening the portfolio, reducing friction of implementation and really go-to-market investments.\nJohn Pitzer: Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. For my first one, I'm curious, Mark, how much does test intensity change as you move from 5 or 4 nanometers to 3-nanometers and get all around? And is this a step function in 2023 and then it stays flat in 2024, or is there a growth from 2023 to 2024? So just conceptually, how much does test intensity of complexity, whichever way you want to quantify it, change from 5, 4 nanometers to 3-nanometers and get all around?\nMark Jagiela: Okay. There's a couple of ways you can look at it. Maybe the economic way to look at it would just look at history a little bit. When we see a major node transition in the industry, you can see that the tester market, the ATE market and our revenue grows faster than, let's say, two years into a node. So economically, if you look at that sort of -- and you can see that in the charts we published with the earnings deck that shows the revenue trends against the trend line over time. Certain years or above the trend line, those tend to correlate to when new nodes get introduced. And the new nodes enable a big jump economically, a big jump in transistor count, and transistor count is what drives our business. More transistors means more test times, means more testers. But the last part of this is it takes a couple of years for a new node to reach its normalized volume. So in the first year of production, let's say, 3-nanometer next year, maybe 3-nanometer will grow to somewhere around 12% plus or minus of semiconductor revenue next year. Maybe it's 10%, maybe it's 13%, something like that. In 2024, it will continue to ramp and maybe it will represent closer to 20%, 25%. So we'll see a couple of years of benefit from 3-nanometer as it grows in its contribution to the overall revenue stream.\nVivek Arya: Got it. And for my follow-up, I'm curious, what is your current exposure to 5G modems? And how should we think about how it evolves from 2023, both from a unit and a content perspective?\nMark Jagiela: Modems are a strong area for us. The dynamics are changing a bit there because more and more cell phone manufacturers are starting to build their own modems. So there's been a disaggregation of that market. And by and large, that's a positive trend for us because the relative share position we have at, let's say, the established suppliers of modems was below our average share in the market. And our share at the disaggregated newcomers that are building their own modems is higher. So we look at that as a positive.\nVivek Arya: And is that contemplated in your 2024 outlook, or would that be incremental?\nMark Jagiela: It is complemented, yes.\nVivek Arya: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nTimothy Arcuri: Hi. Thanks a lot. I'm wondering, Mark, can you break down the $4.8 billion SOC TAM in 2021 into the different segments, mobility and compute and autos and industrial and all those kind of things? And then also, can you give us some sense of if you assume the market is flat, which I'm going to ask you a follow-up, it's like hard to believe that the market would be just flat. But if you assume it is, can you talk about how you would see the mix shifting in 2022? And then I had a follow-up as well.\nMark Jagiela: Okay. I'll give you the numbers by the segments as we currently kind of see them today. And, of course, these are estimates for 2022 and 2021 for that matter. But the compute market, as an example, we think last year was about a $1.1 billion ATE market, and we think that's going to grow this year to about $1.3 billion. So there's growth in the compute segment. Mobility last year was about $2 billion. We think that will come down to $1.8 billion. Much of that is due to our concentrated area. Automotive and MCU, we think, is flat at about $0.5 billion year-over-year. Industrials down slightly probably, $600 million to $500 million. And then the service business will grow maybe $100 million from $600 million to $700 million.\nTimothy Arcuri: Got it. Okay. Thanks. And then, I guess, I had a question just on -- I mean, having followed this industry for 25 years, the relationship, I mean, it doesn't hold true every year between WFE and tester market size. But some of maybe what you're seeing in the SOC market is because some of the WFE suppliers are struggling to get tools installed and whatnot. But once those tools get installed, you're going to have to test those chips. And if you compare the size of the SOC TAM to the size of the -- you compare non-memory to non-memory, you have a $60 billion to $65 billion non-memory WFE TAM this year. And if the SOC TAM is only $4.8 billion, I mean we've like never seen a ratio anywhere close to that low. So it would either say that the number this year has to be a lot higher, as that stuff gets installed or you make it up next year. Can you just sort of talk about that? I know that you guys look at those numbers, but it just seems sort of hard to believe that the ratio would be that low. Thanks.\nMark Jagiela: You're absolutely right. And the reason is kind of what you hinted at, is the time it's taking to bring up 3-nanometer is longer than traditionally it's taken to bring up a new node. We're kind of stretching it into a three-year window. So the tool -- a lot of the tools, by the way, have been put in place. Some are a little bit constrained by supply, but a lot of them have been put in place, but tuning the recipe, getting it ready for ramp, and then the cycle -- the process cycle time for the wafers themselves is longer. Once mass production switch turns on, it's incrementally longer to crank the wafers through the whole recipe than the prior node. So there is a throughput. So all of that kind of moves the impact of 3-nanometer to 2023. But the ratios that you talk about is why we've -- we look at this carefully, too, and our midterm earnings model has increased so significantly compared to a year ago, because all of this equipment going in to support this new technology is a bow-wave coming our way. And the only unfortunate thing is it's -- it didn't make it for 2022.\nTimothy Arcuri: Got it. Okay. Thanks, Mark.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Atif Malik with Citi. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nAtif Malik: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Mark, as a follow-up to Tim's prior question about the WFE relation, given that you have a very low or almost no exposure to x86-related spending, which is a very big portion of WFE this year and next year, I mean, how should we think about your test growth? I mean, I think that correlation probably breaks down because you don't have a lot of exposure there and they're spending a ton of spending from government and whatnot. And then what about things like advanced packaging and heterogeneous compute, if you can talk about when the test attach rates become a meaningful driver for those end markets?\nMark Jagiela: Yes. So there's, let's say, Teradyne's growth and the market growth to think about. And the x86 world for example, in 2022 was quite anemic whereas Teradyne's business was quite strong that year because of where we're concentrated and who -- which customers are tooling. So in 2022, the x86 world, I think, is going to be more robustly tooling than last year even. And we won't benefit much from that this year. So that, in fact, is a true dynamic. And then other things happening with advanced packaging and chiplets and all of that, those are moving, I would say, modestly into the market. They moved in cell phones a while ago, but in compute, that's something I think that we're probably not going to feel until 2024 maybe, 3 nanometer will come first and then the sort of more ubiquitous use of different kinds of advanced packaging will follow shortly thereafter. But the two things won't jump on top of each other just because the -- I think the yield concerns of two new technologies at once will keep them staggered.\nAtif Malik: Great. And as a follow-up for Sanjay, is there any impact from supply constraints in your guidance for the March quarter as other suppliers have talked about getting hit from labor shortages and freight-related issues?\nSanjay Mehta: Sure. I'd say the supply impact in Q4, there's really no material supply impact on sales. But in Q1, I'd say we have about $30 million to $40 million worth of supply risk, which we've contemplated in our updated revenue guide. None of this will result in a share loss, it will just be pushed into Q2. But a little bit of commentary on the supply environment. Fundamentally, we see the supply tightening in 2022. Many more semiconductor players are going into formal allocation, which is incrementally -- indicate incremental tightness in the market in 2022. We were under the impression that in the second half of 2022 with the fab and substrate investments that the supply-demand dynamic would alleviate and the tightening with loosen. However, our view currently is that that's being pushed out to the first half of 2023, really based on the discussion with our supply chain partners. And so, while the fab and substrate capital is being deployed and increasing supply, we still see tightness over 2022.\nAtif Malik: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead. \nToshiya Hari: Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the questions. I had two as well, one on the Semi Test side and the other on IA. Mark, I think in your prepared remarks, you talked about Eagle Test and sort of a platform growing 90% year-over-year. I think that's very consistent with some of the TAM numbers you just gave out in response to a prior question. I am just curious how you're thinking about Eagle Test in '22? When we listen to your customers talk about their CapEx intentions, not only in wafer processing, but also in test, the posture is really aggressive, right, whether it be TI or SD or microchip, I mean a long list of customers. Just curious how you're thinking about Eagle Test and why is your TAM estimate flattish year-over-year?\nMark Jagiela: Yes. So there's a couple of things going on there. So the Eagle Test product and the thing that we usually talk about, called automotive, tends to be more the traditional power-related semiconductor content in an automobile. And so as the supply chain needed to be replenished last year and automobile production started to come back up, a lot of the traditional airbag control, antilock brake control, all of those things drove Eagle demand. And we think this year for Eagle, for those kind of devices will be similar to what it was last year, so not growth. And as I said, the market as well, not growth. However, there's another thing that we're having a harder time classifying is automotive, which is the digital content of automobiles. We tend to put that at the moment in the compute market. And those advanced controllers are something that is more targeted and put on our UltraFLEX platform. So we are expecting to see some growth there for applications, automotive applications, their digital content. But for the moment, at least, because it's somewhat nascent and growing, it's bucketed in compute.\nToshiya Hari: Got it. Thank you for that. And then as my follow-up on the IA side, I guess I'm curious, why wouldn't this business grow faster in the near-term. I realize you've got supply constraints. But when you think about the business on a three to five-year basis, 40-ish percent growth is certainly not bad growth. But given the penetration rate of cobots that you guys have talked about, the labor shortages, with wage inflation, I'm guessing payback periods are shorter. So from a user perspective, I feel like it's a no-brainer, particularly with COVID and all these things going on. So is it manufacturing capacity? Is it distribution? I think in the past, you guys have talked about getting the word out is kind of an important dynamic as you grow that business. But why wouldn't this grow 60%, 70%, 80% as opposed to 35%, 40%? Thank you.\nMark Jagiela: Yes. That is the million-dollar question that I ask every day and -- because you're absolutely right. The dynamics are there. The ROI is there. Everything is there. The biggest obstacle to sort of faster growth is the unfortunate fact that to deploy a cobot takes a human and it takes a skilled human, a technician, today to spend some number of weeks depending on the application, putting it into production. And therefore, we're somewhat constrained by the same labor supply issues that all global industry is experiencing. We're growing that 30-plus percent a year, that army. It's not an army that we ourselves hire as much as it's an army that our distribution partners hire, and they are. But there's some practical limitation on how quickly they can hire and train. So the way out of this bottleneck is to make that deployment time quicker and quicker and quicker, which is why we are actually growing faster than we're growing the human fleet of people to install these things. So we've got to widen that gap. We have to get -- to grow 50% only takes 10% more people, for example, in the applications deployment space. But that's the biggest single thing and we're working on that. We're planning though. In the model we presented here, growing \u2013 continuing to grow at this sort of 30% to 45% rate through 2024, we're assuming that every year we're going to make progress on that efficiency.\nToshiya Hari: Very helpful. Thanks Mark.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nC.J. Muse: Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, first question, Mark, if I go back to your commentary three, four months ago, it certainly sounded like the breadth of spending at your largest customer, combined with diversification and share gains elsewhere at new ARM-based emerging players, gave you the confidence that even if your top customer were to decline in 2022 that you'd still be well-positioned. But now you're guiding to an SOC test market relative to advanced test that is $700 million lower, you told us that your largest customer was 19%, which is about $700 million. So are you basically telling us that you're taking your largest customer to zero this year? And I guess why would that change so dramatically in the last three to four months? I think that it was widely known that 3-nanometer was going to be a very small node in 2022, much larger in 2023. So curious what really has changed in the last three to four months in your view?\nMark Jagiela: Well, I think the -- certainly, the macro number around how much our largest customer represents his revenue last year is right, around $700 million at 19% of revenue. No, it's not going to zero. It's going to probably be below 10%. So the magnitude, I think, that the change that has occurred represents is larger than we would have expected. And I think that the transparency -- and even now, the amount of visibility into what that will be is still vague. So it's not something that we typically get full confirmation of it until April of this year, so to speak. So we're working on the most recent inputs that we've received. And I think they're fundamentally -- as I've said in the past, there's always multiple scenarios in flight with the area we're concentrated in as to how the year can play out. And there's a range of forecasts that we get that get updated along the way. And those can swing dramatically as they've done this time. So I don't have any more insight than that or anything that I think is prudent to share around what changed with that large account. But I do think if you go from $700 million below 10%-ish probably this year, that's a big portion of the delta between perhaps what Advantest is guiding and we're guiding. And then we're down into 5% difference on a forecast for the year. And it could be either way, it could be either way. I don't think there's a lot of precision in that on our side or theirs, but I think we're pretty close.\nC.J. Muse: Very, very helpful. I guess my follow-up question on your target model. You're talking about test revenues growing at a 7% to 11% CAGR. I'm assuming that that's your underlying growth rate for SemiTest. And if I make that assumption, then your System Test plus LitePoint plus HDD revenues essentially are like down $200 million in three years' time. So I guess, are you assuming a slower, kind of, growth CAGR for SemiTest, or is there something else going on in kind of the other bucket?\nSanjay Mehta: Yes. It's Sanjay here. So yes. So overall test is growing 7% to 11%. Obviously, Semi Test is the largest component of our test portfolio. But think of our other businesses as growing marginally in test marginally at the same level or marginally a little bit higher.\nC.J. Muse: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Your line is open. Please go ahead. \nKrish Sankar: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I had 2 of them. Mark, thanks for the color on the SOC market size by segment. You mentioned that compute should grow to about $1.3 billion from $1.1 billion last year. I'm just kind of curious, if you can help give a little more color on that on the split between x86 and non-x86. And as one of the large US IDMs start doing more foundry business, is that an opportunity where they would start looking at outside platforms versus in-house-designed SOC testers? And then I have a follow-up.\nMark Jagiela: Yes. I wouldn't attribute it all to x86. We use that as shorthand sometimes in these conversations, but there's other areas like graphics, chips and FPGAs that are also part of that compute thing that are growing this year. So the collection of x86 plus graphics and FPGAs would be the driver of that. What was the second part of the question?\nAndy Blanchard: Foundry.\nMark Jagiela: Yes. So the thing is, I do believe -- there's no doubt that if a company is getting into the foundry business, they're going to have to accommodate external test platforms. The only thing is that, just because there's a new foundry player doesn't -- it sort of doesn't change the overall global market. They're just stealing share from some other foundry who would also buy commercial test equipment. The real question is for their internal product development, will they shift to commercial equipment where today they use in-house equipment. And that -- let's wait and see. It's -- we're not assuming that in any of our midterm plans. So this plan through 2024 does not assume any of that. But you can imagine that the cost of continuing to invest in that is high. And the rate of the roadmap change now for x86 manufacturers is quite high. It used to be a very slow predictable cadence. And now the competition is heated up, and it's fast and furious, it's harder and harder for the internal tester group to keep up with that. So we don't assume to happen, but I think the cards are sort of played in a way that suggests, it's probably going to happen, maybe not by '24, but certainly out in the next 4 or 5 years. That would be my bet.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Fair enough. Fair enough. Super helpful. And then just a quick follow-up, maybe a 2-part question, if I can. On the IA side, if throughput issue for you when as the industrial robotic folks start getting into down the tail or it seems like they might be faster than the cobot, is that an issue from your vantage point? And then just a quick follow-up is, I think advances when they talk about SOC market, they include services in it. You guys do not. So, is that a way of what you think services would be this year versus last year? Maybe this can explain a couple of hundred million dollar difference maybe?\nMark Jagiela: Yes. So first, on the speed of the robot question. Yes, traditional industrial robots tend to have much faster cycle times. They can pick and move and place things at a lightning speed. That's partly why they're dangerous, partly why they're in cages. They're kept away from people. And those products have been around for decades, frankly, decades. Collaborative robots is really opening up a whole new application space where those 20-year-old fast products couldn't perform for some reason, either because the cost of isolating them from humans was too high or the flexibility that they had in terms of repeatability and such wasn't good enough or the time to change over for a higher mix environment was onerous. If it's picking up one thing and moving one thing 1,000 times a minute for years, it's the right solution and it's been solved. So, co-bots is a brand new thing. It's -- all the places those things didn't make sense that we're opening up with co-bots. And I think that's what's exciting. So, I don't think there's any news there. And your last question was service in the TAM, yes. I think we estimated somewhere in the $600 million to $700 million range. I frankly don't know what Advantest estimates on that, but it's probably close.\nKrish Sankar: Thanks Mark.\nAndy Blanchard: And operator, we have time for just one more question, please.\nOperator: All right. Then our last question will come from the line of Brian Chin with Stifel. Your line is open, please go ahead.\nBrian Chin: Hi, good morning. Thanks for squeezing us in. I'm just ask a few questions. I guess, first, on the Semi Test side, on a quarterly basis, Mark, it looks like the year-over-year declines might bottom out in 2Q and certainly first half. But I guess, off this lower first half revenue base, has it been unfair to expect unit seasonality, or do you think a typical sort of 52%, 48% first half, second half relationship still applies given sort of your views for the TAM this year?\nMark Jagiela: Yes. The second -- we've proven in the last two years that we're not good forecasting the second half of the year. But because of this abnormality in the first half, I would expect on average that you're going to see a little more of a second half weighting because we kind of have this a little bit of an abnormal hole in the first. So, it wouldn't be a typical year, they're probably be a little more back weighted.\nBrian Chin: Okay. So, not even level set but maybe even a stronger bias to second half.\nMark Jagiela: Yes.\nBrian Chin: Okay. Interesting. And I guess on the Industrial Automation side, based on your commentary, there's constraints and I'd imagine you expect year-over-year growth to slow near term but accelerate moving across the year. Can you give us a sense of the magnitude of revenue impact this is creating in first half? And do you view that demand as perishable or shifting to second half?\nSanjay Mehta: Brian, are you asking a question about supply?\nBrian Chin: Well, it's supply -- the overlay of supply constraints against the demand profile you see in Industrial Automation. It sounds like there was a talk of some constraints or even severe constraints in first half in that business. And so I'm kind of wondering what that revenue impact then is and also if it just shifts to the second half or if it's perishable.\nSanjay Mehta: Yes, so demand is quite strong and in Q1, out of the $30 million to $40 million I noted, about $10 million of it is tied to IA. And really just given the allocation for Q2, our commentary in my prepared remarks, it had a little bit of the impact there. So it's true we are seeing some supply impact in the first half. But I would say that from a first half, second half, we do expect demand in and revenue in the second half for IA to be larger than the first half.\nBrian Chin: Okay. Great. Thanks, Sanjay.\nAndy Blanchard: All right, folks. We are out of time. For those in the queue, I'll follow up with you off-line, and thanks for joining us, and we look forward to talking to you in the weeks ahead. Bye-bye.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark Jagiela",
            "content": "Good morning and thanks for joining us. On our call today, I'll summarize 2001's [ph] fourth quarter and the full year and then comment on our early view of 2022. Sanjay will then provide the financial details and review our updated earnings model and capital allocation plans. While we forecast 2022 to be another solid year for Teradyne, overall sales will likely decline in the first half, as we believe SOC test sales will be impacted by modest complexity growth in our largest market, as the jump to 3-nanometer production is pushed to 2023. More on that in a minute. Recapping 2021. We finished the year strong, bringing full year sales, non-GAAP earnings growth to 19% and sales growth to -- sorry, the sales growth of 19% and GAAP earnings growth to 29%, respectively. 2021's performance was a result of broad-based growth across our Test and IA businesses. SemiTest sales grew about 17%, with our UltraFLEX family contributing to the expansion into the compute sector and Eagle product lines serving the automotive and analog industrial sectors, growing nearly 90%. For 2021, we estimate the SOC market was about $4.8 billion, up from $3.6 billion in 2020, which puts our market share at about 46% for the year. The memory market in 2021 was about flat with 2020 at approximately $1 billion. Our Magnum family continues to shine in the NAND segment, and we're reinforcing our position in the DRAM segment, as the industry prepares for LPDDR5 and DDR5 ramps in 2022 and beyond. Our share remains at about 40%. LitePoint's wireless test business had a great year, growing 25% from 2020. The global demand for connecting and tracking, just about everything, machines, materials and people is nearly insatiable. LitePoint is well aligned to this trend with products that simplify testing of the expanding range of wireless standards. Whether in networking with WiFi 6E and 7, in location tracking with ultra wideband and cellular with 5G or numerous other standards, the rate of technology change continues unabated, which is great for our business. Moving to our Industrial Automation business. At UR, sales were up 41% from 2020. We continue to expand the number of UR+ partners and certified plug-and-play apps with assembly, machine tending and palletizing among the most popular of the more than 375 available apps. We also continue to broaden our reach beyond existing markets, often with OEM partners. One exceptional example is our expansion into welding applications, where we finished the year with a growth of more than 3x above 2020 levels. Welding applications now account for more than 6% of UR sales. At MiR, full year sales grew 42% from 2020 on the strength of our new higher payload MiR250, 600 and 1,350 kilogram AMRs. It's also notable that the value of MiR AMRs with advanced fleet management software is amplified as the size of the robot fleet grows. We saw this play out last year with large account sales, those with the potential to deploy hundreds of units, growing nearly 50% faster than the installed base at large. Looking ahead to 2022, the long-term drivers that power our growth in Test and Industrial Automation are strong. In fact, as you will hear from Sanjay, our updated 2024 earnings model reflects an expected higher growth in sales and profits for both areas. However in 2022, while we expect our IA business to power along with 35% plus growth, we see our SOC business likely contracting during the year as the shift to 3-nanometer volume production is pushed to 2023. You can begin to see some of this effect in our 1Q guidance as we usually see the beginnings of our summer ramp in March. We expect 2Q to show similar effects as it's usually our peak tooling period for our largest market. As a result, we are modeling first half sales down 15% to 20%. We don't expect the impact of this to extend into second half. We expect demand to accelerate again in 2023 as we begin to see the complexity growth related to investments for 3-nanometer, gate-all-around and advanced packaging. Overall, we expect the 2022 SOC market to be similar in size to 2021 at approximately $4.6 billion to $5 billion. Shifting to memory test. We expect the market in 2022 to be in the $900 million to $1.1 billion range with a midpoint that's similar to 2021. We expect spending will be weighted toward DRAM as LPDDR5 adoption expands and DDR5 for server applications ramp. In the past, a shift to spending in DRAM would be a significant headwind for us, but we expect we'll maintain our share at about 40% in 2022 as our Magnum EPIC DRAM tester grows in market popularity. In System Test, after 5 years of high growth driven by the Storage Test product line, we expect 2022 to be a digestion year with sales softening slightly. Wireless Test at LitePoint, however is expected to fill that revenue gap, so we expect the combined System Test and Wireless Test will be about flat with 2021. Shifting from Test to Industrial Automation. Our business outlook is brighter than ever. As I noted in our last call, the penetration rate of both collaborative robots and autonomous mobile robots is under 3%. The economic environment is favorable with worker shortages, the movement of production capacity closer to end markets and a relentless drive for higher quality and safer operations, all helping to drive demand. The opportunity in front of us is immense, and we are investing to exploit it to the fullest. At the IA segment level, we've increased our long-term revenue growth rate and expect our sales in 2022 to grow more than 35% off of 2021. Sanjay will provide the long-term modeling details, but the key point is the investments we've made and will continue to make position us for both short- and long-term success in this expanding market. Expanding OEM relationships and served markets is a key part of our strategy. Like the welding initiative that is bearing fruit, we have several others in flight. One example is in e-commerce. One of our partners, Nimble Robotics, uses AI, unique grippers and clever software on our UR cobot platform to pick consumer goods and high-volume warehouse operations for numerous national brands. You may have seen the recent Wall Street Journal article complete with photos of the solution in action. Their innovative solution, dubbed goods to robot, complements automated storage and retrieval systems widely used in e-commerce. Our cobot ease of use and durability are a natural for this application. Well over 15 million items across 500,000 unique products have been picked to date as Nimble executes an ambitious growth plan in the e-commerce space. Another driver of growth in IA has been the growing use of UR cobots to improve the competitiveness of local manufacturing to support reshoring of production. Pantech, a Finnish maker of high-quality ceramics is a good example. They've added automation to allow skilled craftspeople to focus on high-volume and high-value tasks. While UR cobots do the repetitive and physically demanding ones, such as glazing and finishing of ceramics. To summarize, 2021 was another year of impressive growth at Teradyne and caps a five-year stretch where sales and non-GAAP earnings have grown at a compounded rate of 16% and 32%, respectively. As we've said before, we've managed the business to a trend line model. Our updated 2024 earnings model shows improved growth trend lines reflecting our increasing confidence in the business. These projections are not hockey sticks. They are consistent with our past performance and correlated to investment trends in semiconductor automation market drivers. Along the way, we expect some years will perform above the trend line and other years below. In Test, 2020 and 2021 were above trend line years, while 2022 will likely be below. These year-to-year swings in customer buying patterns are a part of our market dynamics. Our underlying business model with outsourced manufacturing and test is designed to efficiently absorb these dynamics. Also, our good and improving gross margins give us increasing leverage within this dynamic. The growth in volume and complexity of semiconductors that propels the test market is stronger than ever. Our Industrial Automation portfolio is well positioned against macro trends and back to high growth. All these dynamics should net out to attractive mid-term growth of both sales and earnings. With that, I turn it over to Sanjay for more details. Sanjay? Yes, it's a good question. I saw those numbers, too. I think there's two phenomenas that you cited going on. I think we are a bit lower than them in terms of the annual market size guide. Part of that is due to the fact that probably what our largest concentration is doing this year is somewhat opaque to them. And so that's a factor that's probably not in their numbers. And I do think if you look at the rest of the market, excluding that high concentration of ours, there is growth this year in the market is what we expect. So, probably -- it's almost probably 50/50 that gets the difference. Okay. There's a couple of ways you can look at it. Maybe the economic way to look at it would just look at history a little bit. When we see a major node transition in the industry, you can see that the tester market, the ATE market and our revenue grows faster than, let's say, two years into a node. So economically, if you look at that sort of -- and you can see that in the charts we published with the earnings deck that shows the revenue trends against the trend line over time. Certain years or above the trend line, those tend to correlate to when new nodes get introduced. And the new nodes enable a big jump economically, a big jump in transistor count, and transistor count is what drives our business. More transistors means more test times, means more testers. But the last part of this is it takes a couple of years for a new node to reach its normalized volume. So in the first year of production, let's say, 3-nanometer next year, maybe 3-nanometer will grow to somewhere around 12% plus or minus of semiconductor revenue next year. Maybe it's 10%, maybe it's 13%, something like that. In 2024, it will continue to ramp and maybe it will represent closer to 20%, 25%. So we'll see a couple of years of benefit from 3-nanometer as it grows in its contribution to the overall revenue stream. Modems are a strong area for us. The dynamics are changing a bit there because more and more cell phone manufacturers are starting to build their own modems. So there's been a disaggregation of that market. And by and large, that's a positive trend for us because the relative share position we have at, let's say, the established suppliers of modems was below our average share in the market. And our share at the disaggregated newcomers that are building their own modems is higher. So we look at that as a positive. It is complemented, yes. Okay. I'll give you the numbers by the segments as we currently kind of see them today. And, of course, these are estimates for 2022 and 2021 for that matter. But the compute market, as an example, we think last year was about a $1.1 billion ATE market, and we think that's going to grow this year to about $1.3 billion. So there's growth in the compute segment. Mobility last year was about $2 billion. We think that will come down to $1.8 billion. Much of that is due to our concentrated area. Automotive and MCU, we think, is flat at about $0.5 billion year-over-year. Industrials down slightly probably, $600 million to $500 million. And then the service business will grow maybe $100 million from $600 million to $700 million. You're absolutely right. And the reason is kind of what you hinted at, is the time it's taking to bring up 3-nanometer is longer than traditionally it's taken to bring up a new node. We're kind of stretching it into a three-year window. So the tool -- a lot of the tools, by the way, have been put in place. Some are a little bit constrained by supply, but a lot of them have been put in place, but tuning the recipe, getting it ready for ramp, and then the cycle -- the process cycle time for the wafers themselves is longer. Once mass production switch turns on, it's incrementally longer to crank the wafers through the whole recipe than the prior node. So there is a throughput. So all of that kind of moves the impact of 3-nanometer to 2023. But the ratios that you talk about is why we've -- we look at this carefully, too, and our midterm earnings model has increased so significantly compared to a year ago, because all of this equipment going in to support this new technology is a bow-wave coming our way. And the only unfortunate thing is it's -- it didn't make it for 2022. Yes. So there's, let's say, Teradyne's growth and the market growth to think about. And the x86 world for example, in 2022 was quite anemic whereas Teradyne's business was quite strong that year because of where we're concentrated and who -- which customers are tooling. So in 2022, the x86 world, I think, is going to be more robustly tooling than last year even. And we won't benefit much from that this year. So that, in fact, is a true dynamic. And then other things happening with advanced packaging and chiplets and all of that, those are moving, I would say, modestly into the market. They moved in cell phones a while ago, but in compute, that's something I think that we're probably not going to feel until 2024 maybe, 3 nanometer will come first and then the sort of more ubiquitous use of different kinds of advanced packaging will follow shortly thereafter. But the two things won't jump on top of each other just because the -- I think the yield concerns of two new technologies at once will keep them staggered. Yes. So there's a couple of things going on there. So the Eagle Test product and the thing that we usually talk about, called automotive, tends to be more the traditional power-related semiconductor content in an automobile. And so as the supply chain needed to be replenished last year and automobile production started to come back up, a lot of the traditional airbag control, antilock brake control, all of those things drove Eagle demand. And we think this year for Eagle, for those kind of devices will be similar to what it was last year, so not growth. And as I said, the market as well, not growth. However, there's another thing that we're having a harder time classifying is automotive, which is the digital content of automobiles. We tend to put that at the moment in the compute market. And those advanced controllers are something that is more targeted and put on our UltraFLEX platform. So we are expecting to see some growth there for applications, automotive applications, their digital content. But for the moment, at least, because it's somewhat nascent and growing, it's bucketed in compute. Yes. That is the million-dollar question that I ask every day and -- because you're absolutely right. The dynamics are there. The ROI is there. Everything is there. The biggest obstacle to sort of faster growth is the unfortunate fact that to deploy a cobot takes a human and it takes a skilled human, a technician, today to spend some number of weeks depending on the application, putting it into production. And therefore, we're somewhat constrained by the same labor supply issues that all global industry is experiencing. We're growing that 30-plus percent a year, that army. It's not an army that we ourselves hire as much as it's an army that our distribution partners hire, and they are. But there's some practical limitation on how quickly they can hire and train. So the way out of this bottleneck is to make that deployment time quicker and quicker and quicker, which is why we are actually growing faster than we're growing the human fleet of people to install these things. So we've got to widen that gap. We have to get -- to grow 50% only takes 10% more people, for example, in the applications deployment space. But that's the biggest single thing and we're working on that. We're planning though. In the model we presented here, growing \u2013 continuing to grow at this sort of 30% to 45% rate through 2024, we're assuming that every year we're going to make progress on that efficiency. Well, I think the -- certainly, the macro number around how much our largest customer represents his revenue last year is right, around $700 million at 19% of revenue. No, it's not going to zero. It's going to probably be below 10%. So the magnitude, I think, that the change that has occurred represents is larger than we would have expected. And I think that the transparency -- and even now, the amount of visibility into what that will be is still vague. So it's not something that we typically get full confirmation of it until April of this year, so to speak. So we're working on the most recent inputs that we've received. And I think they're fundamentally -- as I've said in the past, there's always multiple scenarios in flight with the area we're concentrated in as to how the year can play out. And there's a range of forecasts that we get that get updated along the way. And those can swing dramatically as they've done this time. So I don't have any more insight than that or anything that I think is prudent to share around what changed with that large account. But I do think if you go from $700 million below 10%-ish probably this year, that's a big portion of the delta between perhaps what Advantest is guiding and we're guiding. And then we're down into 5% difference on a forecast for the year. And it could be either way, it could be either way. I don't think there's a lot of precision in that on our side or theirs, but I think we're pretty close. Yes. I wouldn't attribute it all to x86. We use that as shorthand sometimes in these conversations, but there's other areas like graphics, chips and FPGAs that are also part of that compute thing that are growing this year. So the collection of x86 plus graphics and FPGAs would be the driver of that. What was the second part of the question? Yes. So the thing is, I do believe -- there's no doubt that if a company is getting into the foundry business, they're going to have to accommodate external test platforms. The only thing is that, just because there's a new foundry player doesn't -- it sort of doesn't change the overall global market. They're just stealing share from some other foundry who would also buy commercial test equipment. The real question is for their internal product development, will they shift to commercial equipment where today they use in-house equipment. And that -- let's wait and see. It's -- we're not assuming that in any of our midterm plans. So this plan through 2024 does not assume any of that. But you can imagine that the cost of continuing to invest in that is high. And the rate of the roadmap change now for x86 manufacturers is quite high. It used to be a very slow predictable cadence. And now the competition is heated up, and it's fast and furious, it's harder and harder for the internal tester group to keep up with that. So we don't assume to happen, but I think the cards are sort of played in a way that suggests, it's probably going to happen, maybe not by '24, but certainly out in the next 4 or 5 years. That would be my bet. Yes. So first, on the speed of the robot question. Yes, traditional industrial robots tend to have much faster cycle times. They can pick and move and place things at a lightning speed. That's partly why they're dangerous, partly why they're in cages. They're kept away from people. And those products have been around for decades, frankly, decades. Collaborative robots is really opening up a whole new application space where those 20-year-old fast products couldn't perform for some reason, either because the cost of isolating them from humans was too high or the flexibility that they had in terms of repeatability and such wasn't good enough or the time to change over for a higher mix environment was onerous. If it's picking up one thing and moving one thing 1,000 times a minute for years, it's the right solution and it's been solved. So, co-bots is a brand new thing. It's -- all the places those things didn't make sense that we're opening up with co-bots. And I think that's what's exciting. So, I don't think there's any news there. And your last question was service in the TAM, yes. I think we estimated somewhere in the $600 million to $700 million range. I frankly don't know what Advantest estimates on that, but it's probably close. Yes. The second -- we've proven in the last two years that we're not good forecasting the second half of the year. But because of this abnormality in the first half, I would expect on average that you're going to see a little more of a second half weighting because we kind of have this a little bit of an abnormal hole in the first. So, it wouldn't be a typical year, they're probably be a little more back weighted. Yes."

            "name": "Sanjay Mehta",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover the financial highlights of Q4 and review the financial details of 2021. Looking forward, I'll provide our Q1 outlook and update our mid-term earnings model and our capital allocation plans. Now to Q4. Revenues were $885 million, and we delivered a non-GAAP operating profit of 31% and EPS of $1.37.Semi Test revenue of $592 million was strong across the board with notable demand for apps processor and RF test in SOC and higher speed flash test in memory. System Test group had revenue of $127 million, up 23% year-over-year, driven by higher sales in Storage Test and defense and aerospace. LitePoint revenue of $52 million was up over 31% and from the year-ago period on WiFi 6E and early WiFi 7 test demand. Industrial Automation revenue of $113 million was up 23% from the fourth quarter of last year on strong demand at both UR and MiR. Non-GAAP gross margins were 59.5%, on plan and down quarter-over-quarter due to lower volume and product mix. You'll see our non-GAAP operating expenses were up $11 million to $253 million from the third quarter due primarily to ongoing industrial automation investments. We generated $302 million in free cash in the fourth quarter. The non-GAAP tax rate, excluding discrete items for the quarter, was 13.6% and on a GAAP basis was 14.75%. For the full year, it was 14.5% on a non-GAAP basis and 14.75% on a GAAP basis. We ended the year with cash and marketable securities of $1.5 billion. Regarding debt to-date, $343 million of our convertible bond has been redeemed early and repaid. We have a remaining face value of $117 million. Turning to the full year results of 2021. The Teradyne revenues of $3.7 billion grew $581 million or 19% year-over-year. $485 million of the growth was from our Test portfolio, while IA delivered $96 million of growth. We had one customer that directly or indirectly drove approximately 19% of our revenue in 2021. Gross margins for the year were 59.6% and operating profit was 33%, up from 57.2% and 30%, respectively, in 2020. Non-GAAP EPS was $5.98, a 29% increase over 2020. We generated $966 million in free cash in 2021 and returned $666 million through share repurchases and dividends. Looking more closely at the components of 2021 revenue growth. As Mark outlined, SOC test revenues grew $371 million or 20% on strength in all market segments, but with particular growth in the compute, industrial and automotive markets. In memory, revenues were $396 million, up 3%. NAND test demand drove the growth in 2021. In System Test sales, sales grew for the fifth consecutive year to $468 million, up 14% from 2020. All subsegments of System Test grew in 2021 with Storage Test delivering the largest increase moving from $242 million in 2020 to $288 million in 2021. LitePoint is also on an impressive growth path. Sales increased to $217 million, 25% above 2020 and has grown at an 18% CAGR since 2016. Growth drivers included the production ramp of WiFi 6E, WiFi 7 engineering systems and UWB expansion. It's notable that UWB is early in its market penetration and we expect a long-term growth trajectory as new applications for this technology emerge. In 2021, IA revenue was $376 million, up 34% from 2020's $280 million level. UR grew 41% to $311 million, while MiR grew 42% to $64 million. AutoGuide sales were under $2 million in 2021 as we continue to reposition that group for sustainable long-term growth. In 2021, we managed through numerous supply constraints at UR and MiR without a material impact on sales. We expect those constraints to become more severe and expect they may impact the timing of some shipments in the first half of 2022. We've considered that in our guidance. Now to our outlook for Q1. Sales are expected to be between $700 million and $770 million. Non-GAAP EPS range of $0.76 to $0.98 on 175 million diluted shares. First quarter guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles and a non-cash imputed interest on the convertible debt. First quarter gross margins are estimated at 58.5% and 59.5%, first quarter OpEx at 33% to 36% of first quarter sales. The non-GAAP operating profit rate at the midpoint of our first quarter guidance is 24%. Looking at 2022. Our first half 2022 outlook is down from 2021. This will be felt in the first and second quarters with expected Q2 company sales to be about 25% lower than Q2 2021 levels. Regarding our OpEx plans for 2022. OpEx growth of 11% to 13% is expected with the majority of the incremental growth in IA. This will likely put our OpEx above model in 2022 before coming back to model in 2023. The OpEx investment this year is targeted at R&D to improve ease of use, broaden our robot product lines and strengthen our go-to-market capabilities, all in support of long-term sales and earnings growth. Turning to capital expenditures. We expect CapEx to be approximately $160 million. For 2022, our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate is estimated at 15% based on current tax laws. Moving to our earnings model. We expect test and IA growth will drive 2024 company revenue to $4.9 billion and non-GAAP EPS to $8 at the midpoint of our updated model. Gross margin is estimated at 59% to 60%, a 100 basis point increase from the prior model and is based on product mix and operating leverage from higher revenue. OpEx as a percent of sales will decline to 26% to 28%, and non-GAAP operating margin expected will be 31% to 34%. The model assumes current tax laws. As shown on the supporting slide, the new model is in line with the trend line performance. Now let me provide a little color. With 2021 non-GAAP EPS of $5.98, we've achieved our previous 2024 earnings model three years early on the strength of our test businesses. As we've done in the past, when building our earnings model, we consider the year-on-year demand swings that occur in both test and IA, but we evaluate our growth on a trend line versus any specific year. Therefore, as in past models, we use the average of 2020 and 2021 revenue as the baseline for our projections. From that baseline, we expect test revenue to grow at 7% to 11% compounded and IA revenues to grow 32% to 45% through 2024. Both growth rates are significant increases, both in absolute and relative terms from our earlier model. In SemiTest, we expect long-term growth will be driven by the steady increase in device complexity across our businesses along with high single-digit semiconductor unit growth. The transition to 3-nanometer and gate all-round technologies will drive complexity growth and higher transistor densities, increased test data collection for process yield learning and longer test times. The complexity point is illustrated by looking at the recent market size trends. When taking an average of 2018 and 2019, the ATE market size was approximately $4 billion. In '21 and '22, the average will be approximately $6 billion. Our earnings model assumes continued growth in the ATE market, and we believe WFE CapEx is a leading indicator of future test demand. This capacity is being put in place to service favorable semiconductor end market trends. First, the compute market is benefiting from the growth of both x86 and ARM-based solutions in higher-performing solutions at a faster cadence than in the past. The ARM solutions include new hyperscale applications along with AI devices for the data center and edge compute. Second, automotive market has elevated to a higher level. Increases in electric and autonomous driving are pushing the growth and complexity and number of chips per car. Third, the analog industrial end market is expected to continue to operate at a higher level as the digitalization of industry continues to broaden. In IA, we're attacking an attractive and sustainable long-term growth opportunity. The market penetration of cobots and autonomous mobile robots remains below 3%, while the range of applications they economically serve continues to expand. Our strategy is to drive penetration higher in existing markets and grow the number of new applications in new industry verticals. To enable this strategy, we continue to lean into our OpEx investments. We'll operate the IA business with a target operating margin of 5% to 15%, while we invest to drive growth and reinforce our competitive position. We don't expect the growth rate to moderate in the midterm, but at the point in the future if it does, we'll dial back the OpEx growth and expect operating margins above 20%. In 2022, we expect we'll operate towards the low end of the 5% to 15% range. Shifting to capital allocation. We'll continue our balanced strategy. This year, we'll increase our quarterly dividend by 10% to $0.11 per share in 2022. Regarding our share repurchases. In 2021, we bought back 4 million shares for $600 million at an average price of $125.74. In 2022, we expect a minimum of $750 million of repurchases, reflecting our confidence in our operating model and the end markets we serve. In summary, 2021 was a record year for sales and earnings. Our global team continued to deliver extraordinary results in a challenging environment. The team's success in balancing customer demand and business needs amidst a constantly changing collection of pandemic-induced constraints was impressive. As we look ahead, long-term growth trends in our end markets remain strong and we've updated our earning model to reflect that outlook. While we expect 2022 will be below the long-term revenue and earnings growth trend lines, we're confident in the long-term trends in our markets and our ability to thrive in them. With that, I'll turn things back to Andy. Yes. So hi, Mehdi, it's Sanjay. So I think the latter part of the question first. As we see revenue continue to grow and with the penetration of the market of less than 3%, we are going to continue to invest in driving competitive advantage, broaden the portfolio, go to market -- across the board in engineering and go to market to continue to capture the market share. From a profitability or leverage perspective, moving more towards the ROIC comment is, fundamentally, when the market starts to slow and growth starts to slow at some time in the future, and we haven't considered that within our mid-term, we don't see that growth moderating over the mid-term with our 32% to 45% growth. At that point is when we will lower the investment. I will comment another point on the ROIC is our gross margins in that segment are above the corporate average. So, we'll start to higher return on the invested capital when revenue starts to moderate, the growth starts to moderate. But fundamentally, we are leaning into OpEx to really capture that market. Yes. And over the mid-term, in our model, we are seeing a little bit of that play out as revenues grow. Sure, the fixed -- certain fixed costs are going to gain on that leverage. But I'd ask you to think about if -- as we grow into different verticals and the applications within those verticals, we're really building both engineering capability in our product, reducing friction in those different verticals of how we can get to reducing the time of implementation significantly. So, a significant portion is tied to R&D as well as scaling the go-to-market in different territories and in different segments. But the quick answer is, as I said earlier, there is some of that scale we are seeing in the mid-term, and we will see that come in. But I just wanted to reinforce the point that we continue -- and plan to continue to invest in broadening the portfolio, reducing friction of implementation and really go-to-market investments. Sure. I'd say the supply impact in Q4, there's really no material supply impact on sales. But in Q1, I'd say we have about $30 million to $40 million worth of supply risk, which we've contemplated in our updated revenue guide. None of this will result in a share loss, it will just be pushed into Q2. But a little bit of commentary on the supply environment. Fundamentally, we see the supply tightening in 2022. Many more semiconductor players are going into formal allocation, which is incrementally -- indicate incremental tightness in the market in 2022. We were under the impression that in the second half of 2022 with the fab and substrate investments that the supply-demand dynamic would alleviate and the tightening with loosen. However, our view currently is that that's being pushed out to the first half of 2023, really based on the discussion with our supply chain partners. And so, while the fab and substrate capital is being deployed and increasing supply, we still see tightness over 2022. Yes. It's Sanjay here. So yes. So overall test is growing 7% to 11%. Obviously, Semi Test is the largest component of our test portfolio. But think of our other businesses as growing marginally in test marginally at the same level or marginally a little bit higher. Brian, are you asking a question about supply? Yes, so demand is quite strong and in Q1, out of the $30 million to $40 million I noted, about $10 million of it is tied to IA. And really just given the allocation for Q2, our commentary in my prepared remarks, it had a little bit of the impact there. So it's true we are seeing some supply impact in the first half. But I would say that from a first half, second half, we do expect demand in and revenue in the second half for IA to be larger than the first half."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Andrew Blanchard. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.\nAndrew Blanchard: Thank you, Patrice. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our discussion of Teradyne's most recent financial results. I'm joined this morning by our CEO, Mark Jagiela and our CFO, Sanjay Mehta. Following our opening remarks, we'll provide details of our performance for 2021's Third Quarter along with our outlooks for the Fourth Quarter. The press release containing our third quarter results was issued last evening. We are providing slides on the Investor page of the website that may be helpful to you in following the discussion. Replays of this call will be available via the same page after the call ends. The matters that we discussed then will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause Teradyne's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor Statement contained in the earnings release, as well as our most recent SEC filings. Additionally, those forward-looking statements are made as of today and we take no obligation to update them as a result of developments occurring after this call. During today's call, we'll make reference to non-GAAP financial measures. We've posted additional information concerning these non-GAAP financial measures. We are appropriate on the investor page of the website. Looking ahead between now and our next earnings call, Teradyne expects to participate in technology or industrial-focused investor conferences hosted by Baird, Credit Suisse, Davidson, and UBS. Now let's get over to the rest of the agenda. First, Mark will comment on our recent result, current market conditions, and thoughts on the rest of 2021 and 2022. Sanjay will then offer more details on our quarterly results along with our guidance for the fourth quarter. We'll then answer your questions and this call is scheduled for one hour. Mark?\nMark Jagiela: Thanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. Today I will cover 4 topics, the highlights of our third quarter and the first 9 months of the year, the changes we're observing in the SOC test market, our outlook for the industrial automation market, and how we're thinking about the tests and automation markets as we close out this year and look into 2022 and beyond. As our Q3 results demonstrate, demand remains strong across all of our businesses. At the Company level, Q3 sales grew 16% from last year's record Q3 and non-GAAP EPS grew 35%. We did experience increased supply chain bottlenecks in our Industrial Automation business in the quarter and under-shipped demand. Sanjay will describe this in more detail, but we expect these constraints to persist into Q4. Despite this for the first 9 months of 2021, Company-wide sales grew 19% and non-GAAP EPS grew 31% from the year-ago level. In each of our businesses, we are riding long-term secular trends that we expect will drive revenue and earnings growth for years to come and our test businesses, the unit growth, and complexity drivers to power these markets continue unabated. For example, our Semiconductor test business grew 18% through Q3, with SOC leading the charge, growing 22%. Sales continued to be dominated by our UltraFLEX product line, which is well aligned to the performance requirements of the growing compute and mobility markets. Additionally, sales of our Eagle Test Systems more than doubled in the 9-month period as automotive and industrial test markets have also rapidly expanded. Eagle's unique architecture hits the sweet spot in these markets by balancing high precision, with the stress testing needed for these demanding applications. Within SOC, there has been a clear shift this year to higher demand from the compute automotive and industrial markets. While mobility is still the largest subsegment of SOC and growing, it is dropped from the high 50% range of the SOC test market in recent years to the high 40% range this year. Over the mid-term, we expect mobility will remain the largest SOC submarket and continue to grow. But we also expect compute to grow at a faster rate while automotive should remain at its current elevated levels. For the last decade or so, mobility has made rapid annual advances in semiconductor complexity that has enabled the advancement of smartphone sophistication. The refresh pace has been much faster than traditional PCs, graphics, automotive, and industrial end markets, leading to smartphone [Indiscernible] rapidly progressing along the complexity scale. This is true in many areas of smartphone silicate, apps processor compute engines, graphics engines, AI engines, image sensors, power management, and more. Our leading position in testing these key technologies has driven our growth. At the same time up until recently, the traditional compute testing market has been relatively flat, was slower refresh rates and slower complexity growth. However, the groundwork laid by mobility designs, combined with advancing lithography nodes and design tools has enabled new entrants into the chip design space for compute engines. The complexity of these chips, whether for laptops, servers, autonomous driving, AI, or graphics is incredible and advancing at an accelerated rate. For example, laptop CPUs are now crossing the 3 billion transistor level, which is a hugely over previous legacy designs. As we've said in the past, increased transistor counts drives increased test time and increased tester demand. We've seen that this year and there's more to come. We're targeting this expanding collection of new players and new designs leaning heavily into our UltraFLEX families hardware performance and time-to-market advantages of our software. We've been adding new design wins every quarter, and while development pipelines can be long and these new designs can be speculative, we're confident we'll see growing production business from these wins in the future. It's also notable that the traditional chip suppliers in these markets aren't standing still. They are doubling down on their advanced designs too, which collectively driving WFE investments higher as applications expand and competition heats up. We expect this race to lead the higher test times. And given the higher performance and faster designed to market cycle times, more share gain opportunities for Teradyne over the mid-term. Our System Test segment last year -- sorry, our System Test segment year-to-date sales grew 11% from 2020 and storage kept continued its multi-year growth trajectory expanding sales 12% in the same period. Higher capacity HDDs and more complex SOC devices, which required system level test, are driving this demand. Both trends are expected to continue into the foreseeable future. At LitePoint, sales were up 24% through 9 months compared with 2020 driven by WiFi 60 production, WiFi 7 R&D demand, as well as ultra-wide band. More connected devices demanding more bandwidth while managing growing congestion, drive complexity increases in each new WiFi standard and more tests. UWB on the other hand has a whole new wireless standard and application space. It's a new proximity detection wireless technology with a future of many promising security applications. We expect these trends to continue and to provide a long-term tailwind to our Wireless Test business. Shifting to Industrial Automation, Universal Robots revenue grew 50% for -- through the first 9 months of the year, while MiR grew 40% despite supply chain challenges. Each has a unique story. At UR, it's a combination of increasing sales for existing tasks and the expanding number of UR+ offerings, making it easier for customers to deploy our robots to do new applications. We highlighted welding in our last call, but other examples include, screw driving and palletizing. The UR+ ecosystem is key to expanding these tasks and now totals over 360 products created by over 300 partners both riding on and broadening the co-tails of our UR platform. This is a key advantage and the combination of our organic investments and our UR+ and OEM partners are in the dollars and creativity, that's going into expanding the UR platform and it's unmatched. At MiR, the story is about new products. The MiR250 which was introduced just as COVID hit last March of last year, is now our largest seller by far. This year, we added the MiR Hook to the MiR250 family to expanded applications into tugging. We've introduced higher payload products such as the MiR600 and MiR1315 to expand our footprint in the fast-growing logistics market. Unfortunately, with all this good news come supply chain issues that will limit IA growth in 2021 to be between 30% to 40% year-on-year but demand is strong. The long-term outlook in IA remains very bright. Looking at the capabilities of UR robots, today, we estimate the penetration rate is less than 2% of the serviceable market. UR's approximate 45% market share, puts us clearly in the lead and we continue to drive R& D and distribution investments to extend our competitive advantages, expand the serviceable market, and drive penetration higher. It's a similar story at MiR, where we estimate the autonomous mobile robot penetration is under 3%. The AMR market doesn't have a single dominant player like UR robots and we estimate we're close to number 2 in the broadly defined market. And like at UR, we're making investments in both the distribution and product level to both reinforce our advantages and extend our product reach. In both IA businesses, the fact that our penetration of today's serviceable market is low single-digits and that the serviceable market continues to expand each year with product enhancements, sets up a fantastic future. Even with very high growth rates in our IA business, we expect the penetration rates to remain low for many years sustaining our long-term annual growth forecast of 20% to 35%. In January, we will update you on the outlook for 2022 and our mid-term earnings model. Between now and then, we'll be looking at the rate and timing of new semiconductor fab capacity coming online, especially at the more advanced lithography nodes. And we'll also be looking at the rate of adoption of DDR5 as key swing factors. In IA, we will be looking at the manufacturing output expansion, onshoring trends, and PMIs in our principal geographies as tailwinds for continued robust growth. On the other hand, in both markets, supply chain bottlenecks could slow certain industries and become a headwind to growth demand. Short-term demand is influenced by many factors, but we manage our business aligned to the long-term trends. The trend of growing prevalence of increasingly complex semiconductors and a myriad of applications drives our semiconductor business and investments. The trend of new, increasingly smart, cost effective automation in a world with labor scarcity and on-shoring challenges drives our high business and investment strategy. These systemic long-term trends paid an exciting future for Teradyne. With that, I will turn it over to Sanjay.\nSanjay Mehta: Thanks, Mark and hello, everyone. In my remarks, I will review our Q3 financial results, discuss our Supply line strategy in this challenging environment, provide Q4 guidance, and comment on our full-year financial outlook at the midpoint of our Q4 guidance. To the financial headlines for Q3. Our third quarter sales were $951 million was -- near the high end of guidance driven by strength and semi test and wireless test. Gross margin in the quarter was approximately 60%. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $242 million or 25.5% of revenue. The favorability in OpEx drove a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 35% and non-GAAP EPS of $1.59. A few more components of third quarter data. Our tax rate excluding these 3 items was 14.8% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Non-GAAP diluted share count was approximately 176 million. We had 2 10% customers. Looking at the results from a business unit perspective, Semi Test revenue of $688 million was up 16% from Q3 '20. SOC revenue was $575 million up 28% driven by strength in applications processors, RF, industrial, and automotive applications. Automotive and industrial doubled revenue year-over-year. Memory revenue was the second highest in history at $113 million, but down 21% from Q3 of last year's record. Flash final test demand was the strongest segment on handset and SSD end market demand. System Test group had revenue of a $103 million, which was down 13% year-over-year. Recall storage is the largest business in this segment and has lumpy shipments. While storage test will still grow more than 15% for the year, sales including HDD and SLT declined to $56 million on the timing of shipments in Q3. Defense and aerospace and production board test combined grew 10% year-on-year to $47 million. At LitePoint, revenue of $69 million was up 70% from prior year due to early success of our new WiFi 7 product, continued strength and 4G cellular and UWB. Now to Industrial Automation. As in July, given COVID shutdowns that impaired the UR business in 2020, I will provide revenue metrics comparing Q3 '21 results with both Q3 '20 and Q3 '19. Industrial Automation revenue of $91 million was up 32% from both Q3 '19 and Q3 '20. North America delivered the highest revenue growth from last year, but all regions expanded year-on-year. As Mark noted, supply issues, primarily semiconductors, reduced our IA shipments in the quarter. UR sales were $78 million in Q3, up 46% year-over-year, and 31% over Q3 '19. MiR sales were $13 million up 27% from Q3 '20 and 35% from Q3 '19. IA was about breakeven in the quarter and full -- breakeven quarter and full-year, we expect low single-digit profitability. As we've noted before, we continue our strategy of investing during this high growth era while maintaining gross margins to enable mid-20s operating profit in the future. Shifting to supply. We continue to deal with numerous supply constraints across the Company. While semiconductor shortages are well reported, we're also seeing delays in mechanical parts and logistics, all exacerbated by rolling COVID-related shutdowns or labor shortages. We expect these issues will continue through the first half of 2022. Despite these issues, we've been able to deliver record shipments and a big part of that performance as a result of the supply line management, operations teams, and engineering teams working with our supply chain and contract manufacturing partners. We view our operational business model and execution against it as a core competence. Our gross margin performance over the last 10 years displays the financial value of this model. In our Test portfolio, our execution has kept most of our Test or lead times within the range that meet customer's needs to expand their production capacity in this dynamic environment. The significance of this lead time performance is that customer orders more closely reflect through Test demand. So while a bit counterintuitive, we feel that maintaining short lead times are a more accurate indicator of Test demand with lower risk than holding orders with lead times far beyond ship manufacturing cycle times. Of course, our supply line and operations model isn't static. We begin in adding resiliency through both geographic and supplier diversity prior to COVID. Those efforts have accelerated over the last 20 months. This work is paying dividends in the current environment and we'll continue to invest to hardened our supply chain further. Our lead time performance as an example of our resilience and execution. Another example is the ability to scale to significantly increased demand. Auto and industrial sales have more than doubled year-over-year. While we're not perfectly aligned to all customer requested delivery dates, we are managing through delivery issues in a reasonable manner. The value of these efforts can also be seen in the operating leverage and our gross margin line. In IA, we've seen lead times extend from our normal 1 to 2 weeks to 4 to 6 weeks for some products. While this is challenged with the business growing so quickly and ongoing industry supply issues, we've already seen the positive impact of our work in material sourcing and manufacturing cycle times. We expect to bring lead times back to model over the next 2 to 3 quarters. Shifting to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our cash and marketable securities at the end of the quarter totaled $1.45 billion. We had $493 million in free cash flow in the quarter and through 9 months, we've spent a $103 million on capex, and we expect we'll spend a $148 million for the full year. We spent $210 million and $16 million on buybacks and dividends respectively. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 3.3 million shares for $406 million at an average price of $123.53. In 2021, we expect to return over 80% of our free cash flow to shareholders and from 2015 when we began repurchasing shares, we've returned 85% of our free cash flow to owners. Regarding our convertible debt, $302 million of principal was paid in the first 9 months to the convertible bondholders ahead of maturity. By mid-December, bondholders will have converted approximately $343 million, leaving a face value of $117 million. Now, to our outlook for Q4. Sales in Q4 are expected to be between $820 and $900 million with non-GAAP EPS in a range of $1.14 to $1.40 on a 174 million diluted shares. Fourth quarter guidance exclude the amortization of acquired intangibles and non-cash imputed interest on the convertible debt. Our guidance assumes no significant changes, positive or negative, in the availability of materials and assumes that we won't see additional pandemic-related issues. Fourth quarter gross margins are estimated at 59% to 60%, OpEx is expected to run at 28% to 31% of fourth quarter sales. The non-GAAP operating profit at the midpoint of our third quarter guidance is 30%. Regarding OpEx for the full year. We spent a bit lower than planned in Q3 and we expect the full-year OpEx will be about $980 million up 17% from 2020. At the midpoint of our guidance, 2021 will be another year of growth in both revenue and EPS, while sales growing -- with sales growing 18% to $3.7 billion and non-GAAP EPS growing to $5.88 up 27%. Gross margin for the full year should be approximately 59.5% up from 57.2% in 2020, reflecting the ramp of new products, product mix and operating leverage, offsetting component, and logistics cost increases. Our 2021 non-GAAP operating profit rate is expected to be about 33%, up from last year's 30%. Our full-year tax rate is expected to be 14.8% These results put us comfortably in the range of our 2024 earnings model this year. We'll update the model on our regular cadence in January. The breadth of our customer buying in 2021 is also broader than last year. In 2020, we had one customer that drove 25% of sales. In 2021, we do not expect to have any customer larger than 20% of our yearly revenue. This reflects the trend Mark noted about 2021's higher growth in compute, auto and industrial demand compared with mobility demand and semi-test. IA growth of over 30% year-over-year continues to diversify our revenue. This growth is expected to continue over the midterm and become a larger portion of our revenue. In summary, we expect to end the year with another quarter of strong year-on-year revenue and EPS growth. On a full-year basis, we'll exceed our mid-term targets on stronger-than-expected demand on our test businesses, continued high-growth in IA, and excellent execution across the Company. While we don't have a clear picture of 2022 yet, we're confident with the long-term industry trend powering our test and IA businesses remain firmly in place. With that, I'll turn the call back to Andy.\nAndrew Blanchard: Thanks, Sanjay. Patrice (ph) would now like to take some questions and as a reminder, please limit yourself to 1 question and a follow-up.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from Atif Malik with Citi.\nAtif Malik: Hi, thanks for taking my questions and good job in the tough supply environment. Mark, if I look at some of the recent ARM-based notebook processor, the transistor count is growing 2 to 4 times versus prior-generation. You commented mobility to grow and compute auto analog to grow faster than mobility in the mid-term. Understand you guys on January talk about next year outlook in January, how confident do you feel about your SSE growth the next year?\nMark Jagiela: While I think -- at this point, pretty confident. We look at the trends that I just -- you cited and I cited and see that there's very little standing in the way of this increased growth, but the caveat, I would mention is there's a lot of supply chain bottlenecks in the system. With end product get bottlenecked, that can slow down the unit volume demand for new semiconductors. And then the other thing we're looking at is when do these new nodes really come online in terms of capacity. All that $90 billion of WFE that was put in place this year hasn't yet, had a single impact on test. That's all to come. But it depends on when do those\nSanjay Mehta: additional 5 and 3 nanometer fabs come online. That is a kind of a big swing factor in the calendar year 2022 as to how our growth will chunk out and that's why we wait till January because we don't get a good enough visibility on that right now.\nAtif Malik: Great. And Sanjay, as a follow-up, can you talk about concentration within mobility and compute customer on impact on long-term gross margins? There have been talked about price discounts with equipment suppliers by Tier 1 foundry.\nSanjay Mehta: As I stated in my prepared remarks, we won't have any customer above 20%, so it's a broader breadth of customers. And regarding gross margins, in -- throughout the year, we've improved gross margins. And as I said in earlier calls, really driven by a couple of key test systems coming online and we're shipping in volume that have come down the cost curve. We've seen some benefits to product mix shift, as well as our operating leverage offsetting the component cost and logistic cost increases. From a look forward sustainability of that gross margin, obviously, we will give an update to our earnings model in January. But I see the second half of our gross margin performance kind of going into the first half of 2022.\nAtif Malik: Great, thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with FIG.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes, sir. Thanks for taking my question. The first one has to do with your largest customer given your commentary in terms of revenue mix. It seems to me that that particular customer is going to be down 5% to 6%. And in that context, should we assume a return to growth in '22? And this is a trend that has happened over the past several years and should that happen again -- should that have -- hadn't happened again into '22? And I have a follow-up.\nMark Jagiela: We, of course, Mehdi, can't talk about any individual customer and what they might do or not do in the future so that I have to leave aside. But I just point out on your first point, that yes, our largest customer's dropping below 20% in a growing revenue year. The amount that you might think compute that they're falling has to be taken against our numerator of higher revenue.\nMehdi Hosseini: Got it. Thank you. And then I wanted to follow-up to the question that came up 3 months ago when we were looking into your market share in the compute. Can you update us where you are with that market share in 2021? And as hyperscalers ramp their own ARM-based CPUs, how will your market share change over the next 1 or 2 years? Thank you.\nMark Jagiela: Well, like the total SOC market, year-to-year market share is very volatile. It depends on whose customers are buying what in any given year. What our market share might be in any given year, it can -- in a submarket, like, compute, it can swing 20 points year-to-year depending on who's buying. For this year, it tends to be a very good compute year for us. Our compute market shares up in, I would say, close to what our average share is in SOC this year. But I would say that it's not Steady Eddie. It's going to be pretty volatile year-to-year. It has been in the past that probably we'll be going forward to.\nMehdi Hosseini: I know we're supposed to ask only 2 questions, but just a quick follow up. I think what I'm trying to understand is on the GPU side, it's pretty clear that your competitor has dominated and assuming that that were to remain unchanged, I think the incremental change to the computers were all driven by ARM-based. And I was just trying to understand how you look at your competitive position as these new chips come into the market addressing the computer market.\nMark Jagiela: We're very pleased and confident with our progress in ARM-based compute and design-ins in that realm. But, I would say that it's not -- now there's -- the tester market for computes also driven by more traditional X86 demand as well. You've got a couple of suppliers there that are not standing still as I mentioned, and are up being there kind of complexity growth curve. And so there will be certainly a lot of growth there as well, I believe.\nMehdi Hosseini: Okay. Thank you. Thanks for the detail.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Toshiya Hari, Goldman Sachs.\nToshiya Hari: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the question and congrats on the strong execution. I had 2 questions as well. My first 1 is on the supply constraints, maybe for Mark, maybe for Sanjay. Just curious how significant the headwinds were for IA in Q3 and what's embedded in your Q4 guidance? If you can share that, that would be helpful. And just wanted to confirm that there was little to no impact on your Semi Test business. And then on gross margins, similarly, you came in at the high end of your guided range, but was there any impact on your profitability in the quarter from supply chain shortages? Thank you.\nSanjay Mehta: Sure. I'll take those. For an Industrial Automation perspective, year-to-date, we've grown 40% in IA and Q4 demand is high. If we can't supply at all, that's why we've -- and it's going to be growth year-on-year above 30% to 40%. And so predominantly, it's in semiconductors and expect we'll be out of the supply chain crunch given our visibility in Q2 or Q3 for IA. That's the IA side. And then from a supply chain perspective on the Test side, we've seen the supply chain tightening on the Test portfolio quarter-over-quarter where we don't think it's going to be abated until the end of Q2 of 2022. And again, mainly semiconductor parts. Really we see that coming back online in the second half really tied to the wafer and the substrate capacity coming online. And then, from a gross margin perspective, we've been managing through the component increases, logistics increases in cost, and we've -- as I've said earlier, we've had favorable product mix. And as our volumes or revenues are higher, we're gaining operating leverage along with coming down the cost curve of our new products that we've introduced late last year. We're managing through it and it's true well publicized component cost increases.\nToshiya Hari: Got it. That's super helpful. And then as my follow-up, Mark, I wanted to ask about your Eagle Test business. In your prepared remarks, you noted that the business is up more than 2x year-to-date. Historically, like many other parts of your business, I think Eagle Test has been quite cyclical. You would be up for a year, year-and-a-half, 4 to 6 quarters, and then down a little bit as customers digest their test capacity. Based on what you said, it seem like you're expecting 2022 to be another strong year. The question is, what's different this time? As you think about the Eagle Test into 22, I realize there's complexity growth, but you could argue those been complexity growth for a very long time. So just curious on how different this cycle could be relative to past cycles. Thank you.\nMark Jagiela: Right good question. And in addition, automobile unit volume isn't near its historical peak either so how could this thing keep going beyond the normal 6-quarter surge in automotive, which is you're right again, that's the traditional pattern. But I think what we see happening and makes us believe this will persist at least through 2022 is there's a lot of silicon refresh going on that's new in the automotive space, new kind of racing to get new more current generation lithography nodes, silicon and automotive designed. Because the legacy lines out there are hard to get at, chip suppliers are trying to obsolete those fabs. And so the automotive customers don't have as much, I would say, power in this frothy demand environment on the semiconductor supply side. And so the semiconductor suppliers are saying get with the program, move to more advanced nodes. And a little bit of that's happening, which is what? That means complexity, yield issues, and that means a little more test than you might expect, and I think that's what's giving us a different view this time.\nToshiya Hari: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Pitzer, Credit Suisse.\nJohn Pitzer: Good morning, guys. Thanks for me asking questions. Congratulations on the solid results. Mark, I want to go back to increasing test times in the Semi-test business. You've done a good job helping us understand complexity and transistor count. I'm curious as we move from a world of general purpose compute to one of more optimized silicon, you're going to move from a world where you're testing huge volumes in one device to smaller volumes across multiple devices. What does that do for test efficiency at your customers and enhance test times as that trend takes hold?\nMark Jagiela: It is a -- building let's say, 100 billion transistors on 1 chip versus 4, to give an example, isn't equivalent test sign. The 4 chip version is likely to -- these are going to be rough rules of thumb, but let's say 25% more test intensive than the single chip design, because there is a premium on known good die testing to, when you put those together in an advanced package. And then the advanced package itself has more potential defect failure modes that need to be tested. So that's one thing around the whole chip lit multi-chip package thing. The other thing though that's happening, and this is really going to become prevalent at 3 nanometer and beyond is the move from FinFET to Gate-All-Around transistor architectures. And if you remember when the world moved from planar to FinFET, it was back in 2012, '13, '14 era, that drove if you go back and look at the history of the test market, that drove incremental test intensity and complexity in the market. And we're headed for another one of those with Gate-All-Around. There's going to be this new defect modes, new kind of test intensity boosts coming from this new architecture on the transistors. So even at equivalent transistor counts, we're going to see a little bit more test intensity because of that. So these two trends have chip lifts and gate all around and three nanometer. That's probably all of 2023 and beyond story given where three nanometer is right now. But it's coming.\nJohn Pitzer: That's helpful and this is my second question, Mark. Just going back to your largest customer, I'm kind of curious if you can help me better understand the diversity of business with that customer. Clearly, it's been mobility led for the last several years and now, you've got them doing more in the compute space you've talked about in the past, the complexity around these Airtags. Are you seeing a meaningful diversification of demand drivers at that customer? And can you help me because I just don't know, how fungible is your -- is their test capacity across those different product families?\nMark Jagiela: I'm not going to be able to talk too much about the breadth there. I think you can imagine it. You've rattled off some examples. In terms of fungibility, they're pretty fungible, the testers, across what's used for a compute engine in a phone versus a compute engine in a laptop or a desktop or anything else. The one that's a little bit unique is when you get into things like the RF type products, of course have a bit of a different architecture. Power management type products have a bit of a different architecture. Those testers tend to be a little more unique. But we talked about in the past that I think people have looked at us and said, well, in a world where cell phones are plateauing doesn't that -- unit growth of cellphones, doesn't that pertain some kind of slowing for us? And what we've always said is that look, cellphone unit growth can slow, complexity isn't, and some of these customers are diversifying into more silicon both in the phone and now more silicon outside the phone into compute. There are these emerging hyperscalers that are building silicon for both cloud computing and other new yet to be introduced consumer products. The ability of a design team today to be formed and put together a 10 billion plus transistor chip for a consumer application is easier. And as I said in my script, we worked with a lot of them. Maybe a small fraction of them will be hits in the future., but they can bring entirely new classes of semiconductor -- high compute engine semiconductor applications to the market. And all of those are UltraFLEX, UltraFLEXplus family devices.\nJohn Pitzer: That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from C.J. Muse of Evercore.\nC.J. Muse: Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I guess Mark another technology question. You taught us to think about transistor count and thinking about test times or for mobility compute. And curious as we go to more high-performance compute where there are more thermal issues, perhaps more complex software algorithms, how should we be thinking about the test times in that transition?\nMark Jagiela: Well, I think the test times have less to do with the application. The only place where the application drives really fundamentally different test times is automotive because of the issues there. It's more of the technology. So I'll go back to C.J., what I said before about 3 nanometer is going to be more impactful to both test times in phones and in computers and in servers and in graphics and in everything else. Probably then any of those end market applications.\nC.J. Muse: Okay, that's helpful. And Sanjay question for you. Clearly, you're making investments, particularly in IA. But as you look to 2022, can you speak to your outlook for operating leverage? And as part of that, how we should think about OpEx relative to topline growth? Thank you.\nSanjay Mehta: Sure. I'd say we're in the early innings of looking at 2022 and obviously, we'll provide an update in January. But OpEx is growing in a couple of key areas this year, obviously tied to higher volume. We have variable compensation as well as engineering expense tied to our operations to qualify new suppliers, etc. And then we continue to invest in both go-to-market and engineering across the Test portfolio. And as you noted, we're leaning in, obviously into -- as I note on our prepared remarks, we're leaning into our IA investment really to help drive going forward. The other component is the G&A expenses going forward. This was a big year of OpEx growth. The only thing I'd say is that next year is we're not going to be as large percentage-wise growth, but that's really all I have to say on it right now.\nC.J. Muse: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Timothy Arcuri, UBS.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. Mark, I just wanted to see if you could update us on the SOC TAM. You had said 4, 5 last call in the segments of that was compute was about a billion, mobility was 18 to 185, autos were about 500, industrial was 550. I'm just wondering if you can update us on those numbers?\nMark Jagiela: Yes. Good question. Fundamentally, it's in the same range. It's probably trending more up towards the higher-end of that range so I think the numbers, the sub-markets you got right on what we talked about last time. Maybe compute is driving us a little bit higher in that range this -- at this point in time but it's pretty close. The memory is still at about a $1 billion term as well.\nTimothy Arcuri: Okay, great. And then I guess I had a question but just on profitability and IA. I know, Sanjay, you just answered a question about operating leverage next year. But what's the catalyst maybe? This time last year we were thinking I would be 10% to 15% off margin and then it got cut to 10 and then went to 5 and now it's low single-digits. And I get that the penetration there is very low, but what's the catalyst for you to look at maybe we shouldn't be investing so much money and maybe we can optimize OpEx investments? So I guess, I'm just wondering how you think about what's going on in IA and what the long-term profitability target is? Thanks.\nSanjay Mehta: Yeah. So our range, as we've said prior is 5% to 15%, and we expect to be low single-digit as I said in my prepared remarks. But really how we think about it is we manage the business on a think about it as a rule of 40, combining the year-over-year growth with the operating profit. And fundamentally, we're -- as we see or as has been noted by Mark, where penetration is very, very low. And we look at all the jobs that can be automated and the scarcity of labor and economic growth, we really see a strong tailwind for the portfolio. And with that, we are very focused and conscious on both engineering and go-to-market investments. And so how we think about it is quite simple. And that is where we have a strong belief that we're going to grow and it's going to accelerate that revenue growth. We're going to lean into the investment. And again, think about it on the Rule of 40. And as I said in my prepared remarks, our gross margins are actually improving in that portfolio. And so when we see that growth start to moderate, then we'll start to moderate the OpEx to get to an operating profit of let's say in the mid-20s.\nTimothy Arcuri: Okay, Sanjay. Thank you\nOperator: Your next question comes from Vivek Arya, Bank of America.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my questions. Mark, this move to 3 nanometer, is that a benefit for Teradyne in '22 or '23? I thought it would be '22, but I wanted to confirm. And following on for that, what are the top 1 or 2 end markets that you are the most excited about in terms of growth for next year?\nMark Jagiela: On the 3 nanometer question that was one of the things I mentioned that we'll be looking at carefully between now and January when we update you on the 2022 view. And we've seen some push outs on some of those nodes for -- by a few months so the ability to intercept them in a meaningful way in Q -- I'm sorry, in 2022, is a swing factor. We don't see that exactly yet, but whatever happens in 2022, it might get some early ramping but the bulk of it is going to be 2023, '24, '25 and beyond. A little bit could happen in '22, how much we won't know more until January. In terms of markets next year that are interesting and exciting, I think it goes back to these emergent hyperscalers that are developing some new applications and very complex silicon for those new applications.\nSanjay Mehta: Some of those could latch in the market with new product introduction and drive a whole new demand stream for semiconductors and the testers associated with them. That's what we're rooting for and what we're close to. And we're seeing could be breakouts for 2022.\nVivek Arya: Got it. Very helpful. And maybe just following up on that. Is there a way, Mark, to contrast the additional complexity in a product that's going into a hyperscaler application versus the mobility application? I understand by sizes might be different than packaging, etc., might be different. But in conceptually, what does the mix shift from in more mobility heavy end market to something that is taking you more into the compute on hyperscaler land mean for Teradyne in terms of your growth prospects? And also, just the seasonality because mobility tend to be a lot more seasonal markets, those other markets are perhaps less seasonal. What does that mix shift mean for Teradyne over the long term?\nMark Jagiela: Yeah, that's good question. And the range of devices being developed at hyperscalers is quite large. Some of them are simpler than a classic cell phone device apps processor in a cell phone. Those aren't going to have much of an impact even if they latch, but some of them there are more. I would say, leverage AI, machine-learning and high res displays are equal to or greater complexity than what you might find in a typical cellphone application for those technologies so it's a broad spectrum, as I guess the bottom line. But if you play it out, I'd say the hyperscalers are going to on average bring cellphone-like complexity applications to the market. It's probably not going to be something that's -- a lot -- take the 50 billion transistor device, that surprised everybody. It's probably not at that extreme. It's probably more on the 10 billion transistor range on average and then moving up year-over-year-over-year after that as they iterate on the design.\nVivek Arya: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company.\nKrish Sankar: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. Just want to ask the 3 nanometer question in a different way. You spoke about how test investments have to catch up to front-end WFE spending. But during the 3D NAND Mcklin cycle, WFE grew in 2016 and '17, while the Memory Test spending came in 2018 in a meaningful way. So if I rephrase how should we think about the timelines effect of test to front-end foundry logic WFE this time around?\nMark Jagiela: Yeah, good questions. All of the WFE investment gets recognized before -- of single testers associated with that investment. The way to think about test is whenever you see some silicon coming off a new node, assume that the testers were installed maybe 3 months or so prior to that. Once a 3 nanometer fab comes online and you start to see product coming off a bit in reasonable volume more than pilot line volume, assume that the tester installations occurred about 3 months prior. That's the best guidance I can give you there. And then the only other thing I would caution about memory versus SOC is that the curve of test time to bit -- to transistor count, is not the same in memory as it is on SOC. Memory tends to be a bit more efficient for reasons I won't get into here. So you can double transistors and memory, and you're not going to probably move test time more than 20%, 30% or so, let's say, whereas in SOC it's not quite linear, but it's closer.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. That's very helpful, Mark. We had a follow-up for Sanjay on gross margins. Despite the constrained environment, gross margins have stepped up about 200+ basis points over the last 4 quarters or so to a 59% - 60% range. Is this kind of the new baseline we should assume at these revenue run rates? Thank you.\nSanjay Mehta: I think I've talked about that earlier. We're going through our strategic planning process in Q4 and it's really the basis of our earnings model update in January. As I've said, just having some visibility into the first half of next year, I think you should expect to see that gross margin be similar in the first half of next year, as we have in the second half of 2021 from -- and so there's many different variables in there. I noted that we've been managing through the component and logistics cost increase. We've had good mix and come down the cost curve of our new products and gaining operating leverage. There's many variables in there that we're going to look at closely. And as our revenue gets more and more diversified, there's a lot of puts and takes, but we'll provide more guidance on that in the January call.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Thanks, Sanjay.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brian Chin, Stifel.\nBrian Chin: Hi there. Good morning. Nice results and thanks for letting us ask a few questions. Sorry, first to clarify something going back on the commentary. If you had more chips, you would be able to ship to an appreciably higher level of revenue in both the Semi Test and Industrial Automation businesses in Q4, did I hear that correctly?\nSanjay Mehta: In Industrial Automation percentage wise, we'd be able to ship more. In the Test portfolio, we think we're going to manage through the majority of the supply issues at this point.\nBrian Chin: Okay. Great. And then interesting discussion here on 3 nanometer and a fulcrum event in terms of test intensity again at 3 nanometer or Gate-All-Around. Maybe a couple of questions as my follow-up. What is it about that, I know it probably is a longer form discussion, but in short form, what is it about 3 nanometer or 3 nanometer Gate-All-Around? Is it what the yield modeling suggests for lower yield rates there, compounded by die sizes, compared by transistors, or advanced packaging. Or is it also combination of the types of devices that you think that enables in terms of the intersection point of various customers, And they're chip road maps? Just want to get at that, and then like in bigger picture. It's the high-performance compute test cam is a little bit more secular, a little bit more growthy, if you've benchmark test growth, that sort of 4% to 8%. How much of a premium do you think we're looking at over the next several years in terms HPC TAM?\nMark Jagiela: Okay. There's a lot in there, Brian, so let me first of all take on 3 nanometer. The issues about 3 nanometer certainly enables more dense, more transistors per die. That's not what I'm talking about. That's a big driver of test in the future. That would absolutely be something that would give us a positive outlook for the next mid-term. There's the chip lit thing that we talked about where you have mixed nodes going into chips and then you need known good die testing and then the multi packaging needs and increasingly test intensity, that's not what I'm talking about, but that's real and that's there too. The thing that I'm talking about with 3 nanometer that's unique, let's say, is the change in the transistor architecture from FinFET to Gate-All-Around. That happens once per decade. Again, it happened with FinFET s earlier in the last decade. It's happening with Gate-All-Around here in the next few years. Those transitions, everything else being equal, introduce additional, typically failure modes that need more test methodologies to make sure the device is functioning correctly. And so, let's say, the average test time per transistor contend to be higher because of the additional verification needed related to that new architecture. Now, early in the architecture's life that tends to be higher as the architecture matures over time. That premium, let's say, comes down. So -- and the world doesn't shift to 3 nanometer in mass day one either. There's this bleeding up of certain devices using 3 nanometer that are highly test intensive. And more and more come online year-after-year. And then, the learning curve comes on. But net-net, again, if you look at the Test market from 20 -- 2000 to 2012, it had been a declining market in 2012 to now, it's been growing quite well in excess of 10%. Part of that is the parallel testing ameliorating that we've talked about. Part of it's the FinFET story that we've talked about and the growing transistor count. So we're at another one of those junctures with Gate-All-Around. Sorry, the HPC and --\nSanjay Mehta: Tested HPC higher or lower?\nMark Jagiela: Yeah. The high -- the growth rate in compute is certainly going to be at the higher end of our mix of submarkets we think over the mid-term. If you think the average market growth rate, we're going to update this in January, but pick a number is 8%. We think compute's probably leading that by at least a couple of points.\nBrian Chin: Okay. Great. That's helpful. Thanks for all the color on that.\nAndrew Blanchard: And Operator, we have time for one more question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Your final question comes from Sidney Ho Deutsche Bank.\nSidney Ho: Thanks for taking my question. I have two quick ones. The first one is, you talked about supply constraining -- constraint impact in your IA business. I'm just curious, the gross margin has been pretty good overall. You talked about offering a leverage [Indiscernible]. To the extent that your input cost of logistics and freight costs increase both in your Test and IA business, are you able to pass along some of those costs to your customers?\nSanjay Mehta: At this point, we've been managing through it so materially, no.\nSidney Ho: Okay. Maybe my follow-up question is lot of discussion on 3 nanometers today. But it's really an opportunity in 2023 and beyond. If you have look at next year, I know you're going to update us in January. How does it impact your tester business if a customer chooses to move from -- instead of going to 3 nanometer they go to a different generation of 5 nanometers, what is the tester reuse rate when you compare to two nodes between the 3 nanometers and the alternative?\nMark Jagiela: Yeah. The tester reuse, people will reuse 5-nanometer generation testers in the 3-nanometer era so a new tester is not required. And testers tend to have a useful life of a decade or more at a customer, and they can span usability across many, many nodes and many, many generations of devices. There's nothing in terms of a new tester here that comes with 3-nanometer. And yes, by and large, it's a 2023 and beyond type story. But absent that story, what we've been seeing for the past 10 years in Test, since 3-nanometer in 2022 is likely not going to be a huge event because of -- it's likely to be later in the year.\nMark Jagiela: People will still move down the complexity curve at 5 and 5+ nanometer nodes and increase transistor counts in such along that path. Even absent 3 nanometer, we have an optimistic view of what 2022 looks like. We'll probably start out the year similar to how we started out years in the past and at the beginning of the year with some modest growth in the first quarter and then it swings on what's going to happen over the summer, which is our peak quarters around the refreshes. Will those refreshes of silicon be in 3 nanometer? Will they be in 5+ with the traditional normal transistor count growth that we've seen for the past 10 years? Those are things that we have to get closer to next year to really understand.\nSidney Ho: Great. Thank you very much.\nMark Jagiela: Okay, everybody, we are out of time. Thanks so much for joining us today and those in the queue, I'll get back to you later today, and again, thanks, everyone, for joining.\nSanjay Mehta: Bye bye.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark Jagiela",
            "content": "Thanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. Today I will cover 4 topics, the highlights of our third quarter and the first 9 months of the year, the changes we're observing in the SOC test market, our outlook for the industrial automation market, and how we're thinking about the tests and automation markets as we close out this year and look into 2022 and beyond. As our Q3 results demonstrate, demand remains strong across all of our businesses. At the Company level, Q3 sales grew 16% from last year's record Q3 and non-GAAP EPS grew 35%. We did experience increased supply chain bottlenecks in our Industrial Automation business in the quarter and under-shipped demand. Sanjay will describe this in more detail, but we expect these constraints to persist into Q4. Despite this for the first 9 months of 2021, Company-wide sales grew 19% and non-GAAP EPS grew 31% from the year-ago level. In each of our businesses, we are riding long-term secular trends that we expect will drive revenue and earnings growth for years to come and our test businesses, the unit growth, and complexity drivers to power these markets continue unabated. For example, our Semiconductor test business grew 18% through Q3, with SOC leading the charge, growing 22%. Sales continued to be dominated by our UltraFLEX product line, which is well aligned to the performance requirements of the growing compute and mobility markets. Additionally, sales of our Eagle Test Systems more than doubled in the 9-month period as automotive and industrial test markets have also rapidly expanded. Eagle's unique architecture hits the sweet spot in these markets by balancing high precision, with the stress testing needed for these demanding applications. Within SOC, there has been a clear shift this year to higher demand from the compute automotive and industrial markets. While mobility is still the largest subsegment of SOC and growing, it is dropped from the high 50% range of the SOC test market in recent years to the high 40% range this year. Over the mid-term, we expect mobility will remain the largest SOC submarket and continue to grow. But we also expect compute to grow at a faster rate while automotive should remain at its current elevated levels. For the last decade or so, mobility has made rapid annual advances in semiconductor complexity that has enabled the advancement of smartphone sophistication. The refresh pace has been much faster than traditional PCs, graphics, automotive, and industrial end markets, leading to smartphone [Indiscernible] rapidly progressing along the complexity scale. This is true in many areas of smartphone silicate, apps processor compute engines, graphics engines, AI engines, image sensors, power management, and more. Our leading position in testing these key technologies has driven our growth. At the same time up until recently, the traditional compute testing market has been relatively flat, was slower refresh rates and slower complexity growth. However, the groundwork laid by mobility designs, combined with advancing lithography nodes and design tools has enabled new entrants into the chip design space for compute engines. The complexity of these chips, whether for laptops, servers, autonomous driving, AI, or graphics is incredible and advancing at an accelerated rate. For example, laptop CPUs are now crossing the 3 billion transistor level, which is a hugely over previous legacy designs. As we've said in the past, increased transistor counts drives increased test time and increased tester demand. We've seen that this year and there's more to come. We're targeting this expanding collection of new players and new designs leaning heavily into our UltraFLEX families hardware performance and time-to-market advantages of our software. We've been adding new design wins every quarter, and while development pipelines can be long and these new designs can be speculative, we're confident we'll see growing production business from these wins in the future. It's also notable that the traditional chip suppliers in these markets aren't standing still. They are doubling down on their advanced designs too, which collectively driving WFE investments higher as applications expand and competition heats up. We expect this race to lead the higher test times. And given the higher performance and faster designed to market cycle times, more share gain opportunities for Teradyne over the mid-term. Our System Test segment last year -- sorry, our System Test segment year-to-date sales grew 11% from 2020 and storage kept continued its multi-year growth trajectory expanding sales 12% in the same period. Higher capacity HDDs and more complex SOC devices, which required system level test, are driving this demand. Both trends are expected to continue into the foreseeable future. At LitePoint, sales were up 24% through 9 months compared with 2020 driven by WiFi 60 production, WiFi 7 R&D demand, as well as ultra-wide band. More connected devices demanding more bandwidth while managing growing congestion, drive complexity increases in each new WiFi standard and more tests. UWB on the other hand has a whole new wireless standard and application space. It's a new proximity detection wireless technology with a future of many promising security applications. We expect these trends to continue and to provide a long-term tailwind to our Wireless Test business. Shifting to Industrial Automation, Universal Robots revenue grew 50% for -- through the first 9 months of the year, while MiR grew 40% despite supply chain challenges. Each has a unique story. At UR, it's a combination of increasing sales for existing tasks and the expanding number of UR+ offerings, making it easier for customers to deploy our robots to do new applications. We highlighted welding in our last call, but other examples include, screw driving and palletizing. The UR+ ecosystem is key to expanding these tasks and now totals over 360 products created by over 300 partners both riding on and broadening the co-tails of our UR platform. This is a key advantage and the combination of our organic investments and our UR+ and OEM partners are in the dollars and creativity, that's going into expanding the UR platform and it's unmatched. At MiR, the story is about new products. The MiR250 which was introduced just as COVID hit last March of last year, is now our largest seller by far. This year, we added the MiR Hook to the MiR250 family to expanded applications into tugging. We've introduced higher payload products such as the MiR600 and MiR1315 to expand our footprint in the fast-growing logistics market. Unfortunately, with all this good news come supply chain issues that will limit IA growth in 2021 to be between 30% to 40% year-on-year but demand is strong. The long-term outlook in IA remains very bright. Looking at the capabilities of UR robots, today, we estimate the penetration rate is less than 2% of the serviceable market. UR's approximate 45% market share, puts us clearly in the lead and we continue to drive R& D and distribution investments to extend our competitive advantages, expand the serviceable market, and drive penetration higher. It's a similar story at MiR, where we estimate the autonomous mobile robot penetration is under 3%. The AMR market doesn't have a single dominant player like UR robots and we estimate we're close to number 2 in the broadly defined market. And like at UR, we're making investments in both the distribution and product level to both reinforce our advantages and extend our product reach. In both IA businesses, the fact that our penetration of today's serviceable market is low single-digits and that the serviceable market continues to expand each year with product enhancements, sets up a fantastic future. Even with very high growth rates in our IA business, we expect the penetration rates to remain low for many years sustaining our long-term annual growth forecast of 20% to 35%. In January, we will update you on the outlook for 2022 and our mid-term earnings model. Between now and then, we'll be looking at the rate and timing of new semiconductor fab capacity coming online, especially at the more advanced lithography nodes. And we'll also be looking at the rate of adoption of DDR5 as key swing factors. In IA, we will be looking at the manufacturing output expansion, onshoring trends, and PMIs in our principal geographies as tailwinds for continued robust growth. On the other hand, in both markets, supply chain bottlenecks could slow certain industries and become a headwind to growth demand. Short-term demand is influenced by many factors, but we manage our business aligned to the long-term trends. The trend of growing prevalence of increasingly complex semiconductors and a myriad of applications drives our semiconductor business and investments. The trend of new, increasingly smart, cost effective automation in a world with labor scarcity and on-shoring challenges drives our high business and investment strategy. These systemic long-term trends paid an exciting future for Teradyne. With that, I will turn it over to Sanjay. While I think -- at this point, pretty confident. We look at the trends that I just -- you cited and I cited and see that there's very little standing in the way of this increased growth, but the caveat, I would mention is there's a lot of supply chain bottlenecks in the system. With end product get bottlenecked, that can slow down the unit volume demand for new semiconductors. And then the other thing we're looking at is when do these new nodes really come online in terms of capacity. All that $90 billion of WFE that was put in place this year hasn't yet, had a single impact on test. That's all to come. But it depends on when do those We, of course, Mehdi, can't talk about any individual customer and what they might do or not do in the future so that I have to leave aside. But I just point out on your first point, that yes, our largest customer's dropping below 20% in a growing revenue year. The amount that you might think compute that they're falling has to be taken against our numerator of higher revenue. Well, like the total SOC market, year-to-year market share is very volatile. It depends on whose customers are buying what in any given year. What our market share might be in any given year, it can -- in a submarket, like, compute, it can swing 20 points year-to-year depending on who's buying. For this year, it tends to be a very good compute year for us. Our compute market shares up in, I would say, close to what our average share is in SOC this year. But I would say that it's not Steady Eddie. It's going to be pretty volatile year-to-year. It has been in the past that probably we'll be going forward to. We're very pleased and confident with our progress in ARM-based compute and design-ins in that realm. But, I would say that it's not -- now there's -- the tester market for computes also driven by more traditional X86 demand as well. You've got a couple of suppliers there that are not standing still as I mentioned, and are up being there kind of complexity growth curve. And so there will be certainly a lot of growth there as well, I believe. Right good question. And in addition, automobile unit volume isn't near its historical peak either so how could this thing keep going beyond the normal 6-quarter surge in automotive, which is you're right again, that's the traditional pattern. But I think what we see happening and makes us believe this will persist at least through 2022 is there's a lot of silicon refresh going on that's new in the automotive space, new kind of racing to get new more current generation lithography nodes, silicon and automotive designed. Because the legacy lines out there are hard to get at, chip suppliers are trying to obsolete those fabs. And so the automotive customers don't have as much, I would say, power in this frothy demand environment on the semiconductor supply side. And so the semiconductor suppliers are saying get with the program, move to more advanced nodes. And a little bit of that's happening, which is what? That means complexity, yield issues, and that means a little more test than you might expect, and I think that's what's giving us a different view this time. It is a -- building let's say, 100 billion transistors on 1 chip versus 4, to give an example, isn't equivalent test sign. The 4 chip version is likely to -- these are going to be rough rules of thumb, but let's say 25% more test intensive than the single chip design, because there is a premium on known good die testing to, when you put those together in an advanced package. And then the advanced package itself has more potential defect failure modes that need to be tested. So that's one thing around the whole chip lit multi-chip package thing. The other thing though that's happening, and this is really going to become prevalent at 3 nanometer and beyond is the move from FinFET to Gate-All-Around transistor architectures. And if you remember when the world moved from planar to FinFET, it was back in 2012, '13, '14 era, that drove if you go back and look at the history of the test market, that drove incremental test intensity and complexity in the market. And we're headed for another one of those with Gate-All-Around. There's going to be this new defect modes, new kind of test intensity boosts coming from this new architecture on the transistors. So even at equivalent transistor counts, we're going to see a little bit more test intensity because of that. So these two trends have chip lifts and gate all around and three nanometer. That's probably all of 2023 and beyond story given where three nanometer is right now. But it's coming. I'm not going to be able to talk too much about the breadth there. I think you can imagine it. You've rattled off some examples. In terms of fungibility, they're pretty fungible, the testers, across what's used for a compute engine in a phone versus a compute engine in a laptop or a desktop or anything else. The one that's a little bit unique is when you get into things like the RF type products, of course have a bit of a different architecture. Power management type products have a bit of a different architecture. Those testers tend to be a little more unique. But we talked about in the past that I think people have looked at us and said, well, in a world where cell phones are plateauing doesn't that -- unit growth of cellphones, doesn't that pertain some kind of slowing for us? And what we've always said is that look, cellphone unit growth can slow, complexity isn't, and some of these customers are diversifying into more silicon both in the phone and now more silicon outside the phone into compute. There are these emerging hyperscalers that are building silicon for both cloud computing and other new yet to be introduced consumer products. The ability of a design team today to be formed and put together a 10 billion plus transistor chip for a consumer application is easier. And as I said in my script, we worked with a lot of them. Maybe a small fraction of them will be hits in the future., but they can bring entirely new classes of semiconductor -- high compute engine semiconductor applications to the market. And all of those are UltraFLEX, UltraFLEXplus family devices. Well, I think the test times have less to do with the application. The only place where the application drives really fundamentally different test times is automotive because of the issues there. It's more of the technology. So I'll go back to C.J., what I said before about 3 nanometer is going to be more impactful to both test times in phones and in computers and in servers and in graphics and in everything else. Probably then any of those end market applications. Yes. Good question. Fundamentally, it's in the same range. It's probably trending more up towards the higher-end of that range so I think the numbers, the sub-markets you got right on what we talked about last time. Maybe compute is driving us a little bit higher in that range this -- at this point in time but it's pretty close. The memory is still at about a $1 billion term as well. On the 3 nanometer question that was one of the things I mentioned that we'll be looking at carefully between now and January when we update you on the 2022 view. And we've seen some push outs on some of those nodes for -- by a few months so the ability to intercept them in a meaningful way in Q -- I'm sorry, in 2022, is a swing factor. We don't see that exactly yet, but whatever happens in 2022, it might get some early ramping but the bulk of it is going to be 2023, '24, '25 and beyond. A little bit could happen in '22, how much we won't know more until January. In terms of markets next year that are interesting and exciting, I think it goes back to these emergent hyperscalers that are developing some new applications and very complex silicon for those new applications. Yeah, that's good question. And the range of devices being developed at hyperscalers is quite large. Some of them are simpler than a classic cell phone device apps processor in a cell phone. Those aren't going to have much of an impact even if they latch, but some of them there are more. I would say, leverage AI, machine-learning and high res displays are equal to or greater complexity than what you might find in a typical cellphone application for those technologies so it's a broad spectrum, as I guess the bottom line. But if you play it out, I'd say the hyperscalers are going to on average bring cellphone-like complexity applications to the market. It's probably not going to be something that's -- a lot -- take the 50 billion transistor device, that surprised everybody. It's probably not at that extreme. It's probably more on the 10 billion transistor range on average and then moving up year-over-year-over-year after that as they iterate on the design. Yeah, good questions. All of the WFE investment gets recognized before -- of single testers associated with that investment. The way to think about test is whenever you see some silicon coming off a new node, assume that the testers were installed maybe 3 months or so prior to that. Once a 3 nanometer fab comes online and you start to see product coming off a bit in reasonable volume more than pilot line volume, assume that the tester installations occurred about 3 months prior. That's the best guidance I can give you there. And then the only other thing I would caution about memory versus SOC is that the curve of test time to bit -- to transistor count, is not the same in memory as it is on SOC. Memory tends to be a bit more efficient for reasons I won't get into here. So you can double transistors and memory, and you're not going to probably move test time more than 20%, 30% or so, let's say, whereas in SOC it's not quite linear, but it's closer. Okay. There's a lot in there, Brian, so let me first of all take on 3 nanometer. The issues about 3 nanometer certainly enables more dense, more transistors per die. That's not what I'm talking about. That's a big driver of test in the future. That would absolutely be something that would give us a positive outlook for the next mid-term. There's the chip lit thing that we talked about where you have mixed nodes going into chips and then you need known good die testing and then the multi packaging needs and increasingly test intensity, that's not what I'm talking about, but that's real and that's there too. The thing that I'm talking about with 3 nanometer that's unique, let's say, is the change in the transistor architecture from FinFET to Gate-All-Around. That happens once per decade. Again, it happened with FinFET s earlier in the last decade. It's happening with Gate-All-Around here in the next few years. Those transitions, everything else being equal, introduce additional, typically failure modes that need more test methodologies to make sure the device is functioning correctly. And so, let's say, the average test time per transistor contend to be higher because of the additional verification needed related to that new architecture. Now, early in the architecture's life that tends to be higher as the architecture matures over time. That premium, let's say, comes down. So -- and the world doesn't shift to 3 nanometer in mass day one either. There's this bleeding up of certain devices using 3 nanometer that are highly test intensive. And more and more come online year-after-year. And then, the learning curve comes on. But net-net, again, if you look at the Test market from 20 -- 2000 to 2012, it had been a declining market in 2012 to now, it's been growing quite well in excess of 10%. Part of that is the parallel testing ameliorating that we've talked about. Part of it's the FinFET story that we've talked about and the growing transistor count. So we're at another one of those junctures with Gate-All-Around. Sorry, the HPC and -- Yeah. The high -- the growth rate in compute is certainly going to be at the higher end of our mix of submarkets we think over the mid-term. If you think the average market growth rate, we're going to update this in January, but pick a number is 8%. We think compute's probably leading that by at least a couple of points. Yeah. The tester reuse, people will reuse 5-nanometer generation testers in the 3-nanometer era so a new tester is not required. And testers tend to have a useful life of a decade or more at a customer, and they can span usability across many, many nodes and many, many generations of devices. There's nothing in terms of a new tester here that comes with 3-nanometer. And yes, by and large, it's a 2023 and beyond type story. But absent that story, what we've been seeing for the past 10 years in Test, since 3-nanometer in 2022 is likely not going to be a huge event because of -- it's likely to be later in the year. People will still move down the complexity curve at 5 and 5+ nanometer nodes and increase transistor counts in such along that path. Even absent 3 nanometer, we have an optimistic view of what 2022 looks like. We'll probably start out the year similar to how we started out years in the past and at the beginning of the year with some modest growth in the first quarter and then it swings on what's going to happen over the summer, which is our peak quarters around the refreshes. Will those refreshes of silicon be in 3 nanometer? Will they be in 5+ with the traditional normal transistor count growth that we've seen for the past 10 years? Those are things that we have to get closer to next year to really understand. Okay, everybody, we are out of time. Thanks so much for joining us today and those in the queue, I'll get back to you later today, and again, thanks, everyone, for joining."

            "content": "Thanks, Mark and hello, everyone. In my remarks, I will review our Q3 financial results, discuss our Supply line strategy in this challenging environment, provide Q4 guidance, and comment on our full-year financial outlook at the midpoint of our Q4 guidance. To the financial headlines for Q3. Our third quarter sales were $951 million was -- near the high end of guidance driven by strength and semi test and wireless test. Gross margin in the quarter was approximately 60%. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were $242 million or 25.5% of revenue. The favorability in OpEx drove a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 35% and non-GAAP EPS of $1.59. A few more components of third quarter data. Our tax rate excluding these 3 items was 14.8% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Non-GAAP diluted share count was approximately 176 million. We had 2 10% customers. Looking at the results from a business unit perspective, Semi Test revenue of $688 million was up 16% from Q3 '20. SOC revenue was $575 million up 28% driven by strength in applications processors, RF, industrial, and automotive applications. Automotive and industrial doubled revenue year-over-year. Memory revenue was the second highest in history at $113 million, but down 21% from Q3 of last year's record. Flash final test demand was the strongest segment on handset and SSD end market demand. System Test group had revenue of a $103 million, which was down 13% year-over-year. Recall storage is the largest business in this segment and has lumpy shipments. While storage test will still grow more than 15% for the year, sales including HDD and SLT declined to $56 million on the timing of shipments in Q3. Defense and aerospace and production board test combined grew 10% year-on-year to $47 million. At LitePoint, revenue of $69 million was up 70% from prior year due to early success of our new WiFi 7 product, continued strength and 4G cellular and UWB. Now to Industrial Automation. As in July, given COVID shutdowns that impaired the UR business in 2020, I will provide revenue metrics comparing Q3 '21 results with both Q3 '20 and Q3 '19. Industrial Automation revenue of $91 million was up 32% from both Q3 '19 and Q3 '20. North America delivered the highest revenue growth from last year, but all regions expanded year-on-year. As Mark noted, supply issues, primarily semiconductors, reduced our IA shipments in the quarter. UR sales were $78 million in Q3, up 46% year-over-year, and 31% over Q3 '19. MiR sales were $13 million up 27% from Q3 '20 and 35% from Q3 '19. IA was about breakeven in the quarter and full -- breakeven quarter and full-year, we expect low single-digit profitability. As we've noted before, we continue our strategy of investing during this high growth era while maintaining gross margins to enable mid-20s operating profit in the future. Shifting to supply. We continue to deal with numerous supply constraints across the Company. While semiconductor shortages are well reported, we're also seeing delays in mechanical parts and logistics, all exacerbated by rolling COVID-related shutdowns or labor shortages. We expect these issues will continue through the first half of 2022. Despite these issues, we've been able to deliver record shipments and a big part of that performance as a result of the supply line management, operations teams, and engineering teams working with our supply chain and contract manufacturing partners. We view our operational business model and execution against it as a core competence. Our gross margin performance over the last 10 years displays the financial value of this model. In our Test portfolio, our execution has kept most of our Test or lead times within the range that meet customer's needs to expand their production capacity in this dynamic environment. The significance of this lead time performance is that customer orders more closely reflect through Test demand. So while a bit counterintuitive, we feel that maintaining short lead times are a more accurate indicator of Test demand with lower risk than holding orders with lead times far beyond ship manufacturing cycle times. Of course, our supply line and operations model isn't static. We begin in adding resiliency through both geographic and supplier diversity prior to COVID. Those efforts have accelerated over the last 20 months. This work is paying dividends in the current environment and we'll continue to invest to hardened our supply chain further. Our lead time performance as an example of our resilience and execution. Another example is the ability to scale to significantly increased demand. Auto and industrial sales have more than doubled year-over-year. While we're not perfectly aligned to all customer requested delivery dates, we are managing through delivery issues in a reasonable manner. The value of these efforts can also be seen in the operating leverage and our gross margin line. In IA, we've seen lead times extend from our normal 1 to 2 weeks to 4 to 6 weeks for some products. While this is challenged with the business growing so quickly and ongoing industry supply issues, we've already seen the positive impact of our work in material sourcing and manufacturing cycle times. We expect to bring lead times back to model over the next 2 to 3 quarters. Shifting to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our cash and marketable securities at the end of the quarter totaled $1.45 billion. We had $493 million in free cash flow in the quarter and through 9 months, we've spent a $103 million on capex, and we expect we'll spend a $148 million for the full year. We spent $210 million and $16 million on buybacks and dividends respectively. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 3.3 million shares for $406 million at an average price of $123.53. In 2021, we expect to return over 80% of our free cash flow to shareholders and from 2015 when we began repurchasing shares, we've returned 85% of our free cash flow to owners. Regarding our convertible debt, $302 million of principal was paid in the first 9 months to the convertible bondholders ahead of maturity. By mid-December, bondholders will have converted approximately $343 million, leaving a face value of $117 million. Now, to our outlook for Q4. Sales in Q4 are expected to be between $820 and $900 million with non-GAAP EPS in a range of $1.14 to $1.40 on a 174 million diluted shares. Fourth quarter guidance exclude the amortization of acquired intangibles and non-cash imputed interest on the convertible debt. Our guidance assumes no significant changes, positive or negative, in the availability of materials and assumes that we won't see additional pandemic-related issues. Fourth quarter gross margins are estimated at 59% to 60%, OpEx is expected to run at 28% to 31% of fourth quarter sales. The non-GAAP operating profit at the midpoint of our third quarter guidance is 30%. Regarding OpEx for the full year. We spent a bit lower than planned in Q3 and we expect the full-year OpEx will be about $980 million up 17% from 2020. At the midpoint of our guidance, 2021 will be another year of growth in both revenue and EPS, while sales growing -- with sales growing 18% to $3.7 billion and non-GAAP EPS growing to $5.88 up 27%. Gross margin for the full year should be approximately 59.5% up from 57.2% in 2020, reflecting the ramp of new products, product mix and operating leverage, offsetting component, and logistics cost increases. Our 2021 non-GAAP operating profit rate is expected to be about 33%, up from last year's 30%. Our full-year tax rate is expected to be 14.8% These results put us comfortably in the range of our 2024 earnings model this year. We'll update the model on our regular cadence in January. The breadth of our customer buying in 2021 is also broader than last year. In 2020, we had one customer that drove 25% of sales. In 2021, we do not expect to have any customer larger than 20% of our yearly revenue. This reflects the trend Mark noted about 2021's higher growth in compute, auto and industrial demand compared with mobility demand and semi-test. IA growth of over 30% year-over-year continues to diversify our revenue. This growth is expected to continue over the midterm and become a larger portion of our revenue. In summary, we expect to end the year with another quarter of strong year-on-year revenue and EPS growth. On a full-year basis, we'll exceed our mid-term targets on stronger-than-expected demand on our test businesses, continued high-growth in IA, and excellent execution across the Company. While we don't have a clear picture of 2022 yet, we're confident with the long-term industry trend powering our test and IA businesses remain firmly in place. With that, I'll turn the call back to Andy. additional 5 and 3 nanometer fabs come online. That is a kind of a big swing factor in the calendar year 2022 as to how our growth will chunk out and that's why we wait till January because we don't get a good enough visibility on that right now. As I stated in my prepared remarks, we won't have any customer above 20%, so it's a broader breadth of customers. And regarding gross margins, in -- throughout the year, we've improved gross margins. And as I said in earlier calls, really driven by a couple of key test systems coming online and we're shipping in volume that have come down the cost curve. We've seen some benefits to product mix shift, as well as our operating leverage offsetting the component cost and logistic cost increases. From a look forward sustainability of that gross margin, obviously, we will give an update to our earnings model in January. But I see the second half of our gross margin performance kind of going into the first half of 2022. Sure. I'll take those. For an Industrial Automation perspective, year-to-date, we've grown 40% in IA and Q4 demand is high. If we can't supply at all, that's why we've -- and it's going to be growth year-on-year above 30% to 40%. And so predominantly, it's in semiconductors and expect we'll be out of the supply chain crunch given our visibility in Q2 or Q3 for IA. That's the IA side. And then from a supply chain perspective on the Test side, we've seen the supply chain tightening on the Test portfolio quarter-over-quarter where we don't think it's going to be abated until the end of Q2 of 2022. And again, mainly semiconductor parts. Really we see that coming back online in the second half really tied to the wafer and the substrate capacity coming online. And then, from a gross margin perspective, we've been managing through the component increases, logistics increases in cost, and we've -- as I've said earlier, we've had favorable product mix. And as our volumes or revenues are higher, we're gaining operating leverage along with coming down the cost curve of our new products that we've introduced late last year. We're managing through it and it's true well publicized component cost increases. Sure. I'd say we're in the early innings of looking at 2022 and obviously, we'll provide an update in January. But OpEx is growing in a couple of key areas this year, obviously tied to higher volume. We have variable compensation as well as engineering expense tied to our operations to qualify new suppliers, etc. And then we continue to invest in both go-to-market and engineering across the Test portfolio. And as you noted, we're leaning in, obviously into -- as I note on our prepared remarks, we're leaning into our IA investment really to help drive going forward. The other component is the G&A expenses going forward. This was a big year of OpEx growth. The only thing I'd say is that next year is we're not going to be as large percentage-wise growth, but that's really all I have to say on it right now. Yeah. So our range, as we've said prior is 5% to 15%, and we expect to be low single-digit as I said in my prepared remarks. But really how we think about it is we manage the business on a think about it as a rule of 40, combining the year-over-year growth with the operating profit. And fundamentally, we're -- as we see or as has been noted by Mark, where penetration is very, very low. And we look at all the jobs that can be automated and the scarcity of labor and economic growth, we really see a strong tailwind for the portfolio. And with that, we are very focused and conscious on both engineering and go-to-market investments. And so how we think about it is quite simple. And that is where we have a strong belief that we're going to grow and it's going to accelerate that revenue growth. We're going to lean into the investment. And again, think about it on the Rule of 40. And as I said in my prepared remarks, our gross margins are actually improving in that portfolio. And so when we see that growth start to moderate, then we'll start to moderate the OpEx to get to an operating profit of let's say in the mid-20s. Some of those could latch in the market with new product introduction and drive a whole new demand stream for semiconductors and the testers associated with them. That's what we're rooting for and what we're close to. And we're seeing could be breakouts for 2022. I think I've talked about that earlier. We're going through our strategic planning process in Q4 and it's really the basis of our earnings model update in January. As I've said, just having some visibility into the first half of next year, I think you should expect to see that gross margin be similar in the first half of next year, as we have in the second half of 2021 from -- and so there's many different variables in there. I noted that we've been managing through the component and logistics cost increase. We've had good mix and come down the cost curve of our new products and gaining operating leverage. There's many variables in there that we're going to look at closely. And as our revenue gets more and more diversified, there's a lot of puts and takes, but we'll provide more guidance on that in the January call. In Industrial Automation percentage wise, we'd be able to ship more. In the Test portfolio, we think we're going to manage through the majority of the supply issues at this point. Tested HPC higher or lower? At this point, we've been managing through it so materially, no. Bye bye."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q2 2021 Teradyne Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is not -- this conference call will resume -- I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Andy Blanchard. \nAndrew Blanchard: Thank you, Phyllis. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our discussion of Teradyne's most recent financial results. I'm joined this morning by our CEO, Mark Jagiela; and our CFO, Sanjay Mehta.\n Following our opening remarks, we'll provide details of our performance for 2021's second quarter along with our outlook for the third quarter of 2021. The press release containing our second quarter results was issued last [ evening ]. [ We're providing slides ] on the Investor page of the website that may be helpful to you when following the discussion. Replays of this call will be available via the same page after the call ends. \n Matters that we discuss today will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause Teradyne's [ results ] to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statement contained in the earnings release as well as our most recent SEC filings. Additionally, those forward-looking statements are made as of today, and we take no obligation to update them as a result of developments occurring after this call. \n During today's call, we'll make reference to non-GAAP [ financial ] measures. We've posted additional information concerning those non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and were available on the [ Investor page ] of our website. \n Looking ahead between now and our next earnings call, Teradyne expects to participate in technology or industrial-focused investor conferences hosted by KeyBanc, Rosenblatt Securities, Deutsche Bank and Citi. \n Now let's get on with the agenda. First, Mark will comment on our recent results and the market conditions as we enter the new quarter. Sanjay will then offer more details on our quarterly results along with our guidance for the third quarter. We'll then answer your questions, and this call is scheduled for [ 1 hour ].\n Mark? \nMark Jagiela: Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, I'll summarize our results for the second quarter and first half of 2021, update on current conditions in both Test and Industrial Automation, and comment on our view for the second half of the year. Sanjay will then provide the financial details on the quarter and our guidance for Q3. \n The strong demand we saw in Q1 accelerated in Q2 as both our Test and Industrial Automation groups grew substantially in the quarter. The long-term demand drivers we've discussed in the past continue to power demand for our products. In Test, it's device complexity and unit growth; in Automation, it's labor scarcity, the need for resiliency and productivity improvement. \n Opening further, performance at the company level from 2016 through 2020 saw our sales and non-GAAP EPS grow at a compounded rate of 16% and 32%, respectively. For the first half of this year, sales are running ahead of that rate at 21%, and non-GAAP earnings per share grew at 29% compared with last year. This demonstrates both the [ vitality ] of the markets we serve and the efficiency of our operating model. \n Significantly, in Q2, we saw Industrial Automation demand recover in all major regions, but particularly in North America. As a result, our production and [ operating teams ] operated at a high pace in Q2, and that pace is [ increasing ] in Q3. For the year, our IA business is on track to grow about 30% from 2019 and about 40% from 2020. \n Looking closely at the segment level. In Semi Test, SOC shipments grew 29% in Q2 from Q2 of 2020 with particular strength in both the compute and mobility end markets. For the first half, SOC sales grew 19%. For the first time in several years, smartphone unit shipments are helping growth in the mobility [ segment ], where as recent years have mostly relied on complexity growth. \n [ IA ] and compute are the 2 largest subsegments in SOC. Automotive, analog and industrial demand continues to be strong. The auto-related semi test market is expected to exceed $500 million this year, the highest level since 2017. This is despite the fact that automobile unit production will be about [indiscernible] lower in 2017 -- lower than 2017. A portion of this strength is test equipment. We're also seeing the impact of increased semi content and complexity per automobile, driving the test market. \n Our memory test shipments also grew in Q2 from Q2 of 2020, up 9%, led by flash tester demand. For the 6-month period, overall shipments were up 18% from last year on solid demand for both flash wafer and [ flash ] systems. This reflects significant growth in smartphone demand, the build-out of new memory capacity in China and the growth of SSD demand.\n Looking at the full year, we are again revising up the SOC market for 2021 to now be in the range of $4.3 billion to $4.7 billion with increasing strength in the x86 GPU and display driver segments. Recall that we have lower customer exposure in those markets with much of this incremental growth going to our competitors. So we'll likely see our SOC share around 48% for the year. \n In memory, at the macro level, our market estimates are unchanged with the test market this year expected to be about $1 billion and our share to be at about the 40% level. I will note that the expected ramp of DDR5 for server applications and the broader adoption of LPDDR5 is pushing out into 2022. \n Shifting to our System Test group, sales were up 26% in the first half compared with 2020, with strong Storage Test demand and a recovery in our Production Board Test unit driving the growth. For the full year, we see System Test group -- the System Test group grow in the 10% to 20% range. \n At LitePoint, sales in Q2 were up 12% over 2Q 2020. While 5G millimeter wave demand is lower than expected, the environment in Wireless Test is improving as we move through the year due to the continued WiFi 6 growth and early WiFi 7 investments. In addition, ultra-wideband adoption is increasing, adding a new growth vector for LitePoint. For the full year, LitePoint will likely grow in the 10% range. \n Moving on to Industrial Automation. The combination of expanding demand across our major markets and the increase in the range of tests served by our Universal Robots and MiR units drove group sales up 57% in Q2 last year [ to 45% ] in the first half. Compared to pre-pandemic 2019, first half sales are up 22%. Supply chain issues have constrained growth a little bit with lead times pushing out about 1 week. \n The demand environment for IA has recovered in most regions from last year's slowdown. America was the fastest-growing major region in Q2 with sales up over 90% from last year. Although we did see a [indiscernible] some countries in Asia where COVID has spiked in recent months, the second half of the year outlook is quite strong in all our major regions. \n Our long-term growth strategy in IA continues unchanged, and we expect long-term annual growth in the 20% to 35% range. This year, we will likely have a growth of about 40% from 2020, and we will continue to invest to enable this growth target of [ 15% ] gross margins, [ get ] a 5% to 15% operating margin during these high-growth years.\n From an investment perspective, we are expanding our engineering programs to shorten deployment times, increase the served market and improve the customer support experience. We are also growing our capacity to support distributors, integrators and UR plus and MiRGo apps development partners as [ they ] engage customers. We are also expanding our sales to OEMs that integrate our robots into their products. \n Last quarter, we noted the expanding range of applications for UR robots into the high-voltage line application with hundreds of [indiscernible] being deployed. Today, I'd like to highlight the success of UR+ plug-and-play applications for Industrial [ Automation ].There is a long-standing and chronic shortage of qualified welders worldwide with an estimated 100,000 unfilled welding jobs in the U.S. alone. While automated solutions exist for large applications like auto manufacturing, customers with lower volume and higher mix products are not well served by traditional automation. \n The integration of a force torque sensor into e-Series cobots enabled the precision needed for this application. And with UR+ [ integrating ] with our partners, we began serving this market about 3 years ago. During this time, welding applications have grown to be about 6% of our global [ sales ]and are on  [indiscernible] 1,000 cobots sold in 2021, more than tripling our 2020 pace. \n As we continue to extend the performance of our UR platform, we expect these high applications had growth vectors to traditional industrial applications. We have similar market-expanding initiatives in play on our MiR platform, but I'll save those details for a future call. \n Summing it all up, the first half of the year has been a strong sales, strong gross margins and earnings growth  [indiscernible]. Longer term, the markets we serve are showing [ increasing demand ] in a future global economy. The importance, pervasiveness and enabling capability of electronics in every [ aspect ] of our lives and industry is driving more fab investment, more complexity and more test. Likewise, the broadening application and fast [ ROI of ] [ collaborative ] robots in a world with labor shortages and productivity challenges is another growth trend. \n Strategically, we positioned ourselves in line with  [indiscernible]  and plan to continue to make [ System ] Test and IA as our full potential while driving world-class [ returns ]. While the rate of change in our markets is accelerating, we are well positioned to thrive as a company and to bring additional value to customers and shareholders. \n I'll now turn things over to Sanjay [ to provide ] additional color on the financials. \nSanjay Mehta: Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll [ provide details ] on our Q2 results, comment on current business conditions and describe [ our outlook for ] Q3. \n Now to Q2. Second quarter sales were $1.086 billion with non-GAAP EPS of $1.91, up 29% and 44%, respectively, from Q2 '20. Non-GAAP gross margins were 59.6%, and our non-GAAP operating expenses were $250 million, but $5 million below the high guidance due to the timing of some nonrecurring engineering expenses.\n Non-GAAP operating profit rate was 36.5%. [ Gross margin ] in the quarter was [ 59.6% ] compared with our plan of 58%. The increase was tied to favorable product mix in the quarter versus planned. \n For context, Q2 2020 gross margin was approximately [ 56.2% ]. In April [indiscernible], we noted that this level of gross margin would continue in the near term, driven by the introduction of several key test systems in early 2020, which would [ take several ] quarters to come down the cost curve. These new product introductions, coupled with heightened costs driven by COVID shortages, were impacting our gross margins in 2020. One year later, we have now most of these test solutions at volume, and they have come down the cost curve as expected. \n The result contributed to higher margins in the second quarter, which we expect will continue in the second half of the year. A component of gross margin improvement over 2020 is higher revenue yielding of leverage in the gross margin line. We had one 10% customer in the quarter [indiscernible] excluding discrete items of [ 14.5% ]on both GAAP and non-GAAP basis. \n Looking at the results from a business unit perspective. [ Semi Test ] revenue of $834 million was up 27% from Q2 2020. SOC revenue was $742 million, up 29%, driven by strength in compute, mobility, industrial and automotive. Memory revenue was $92 million, up 9% from prior year, driven by strength in flash test and flash wafer sort segments. \n System Test group had revenue of $105 million, which was up 46% year-over-year. This is driven by $58 million in Storage Test sales, including both HDD and SLT solutions; [ $27 million ] in Defense & Aerospace and Production Board Test. \n In Storage Test, HDD and SLT demand remains robust as drive densities continue to increase and the number of devices adopting [ SLT spokes ]. At LitePoint, revenue of $55 million was 12% -- was up 12% from prior year due to continued strength at [ WiFi ], increases in [indiscernible] and ultra-wide band test market segments. \n Now to Industrial Automation. As we did in April, I'll provide revenue metrics comparing Q2 '21 results with both Q2 '20 and Q2 '19, so you'll have the full context given the impact of a contracting market tied to COVID last year. Industrial Automation revenue of $92 million was up 57% year-over-year and 23% over Q2 '19. Revenue expanded in all regions in Q2 [ over ] last year, with North America delivering the highest absolute revenue growth. U.S. and Europe represented about 77% of IA revenue in the quarter, with China contributing about 14%. \n UR sales were $76 million in Q2, up 75% year-over-year and [ 80% ] over 2019. MiR sales were $16 million, up 41% from Q2 '20 and 51% from Q2 '19. Recall, MiR had an  [indiscernible]  on Q2 '20 as its robots were widely deployed in automated COVID disinfectant applications.\n The longer-term outlook in our IA business continues to brighten. We expect continued labor shortages to drive new applications for both our fixed and mobile robots. Mark highlighted the shortage of welders and how that has opened up a new market for our UR cobots, but that is just one of many job categories with acute short-term and long-term labor shortages. \n Our strategy is to provide an open platform that creative developers can leverage to solve industry-specific labor shortages. The numerous filling ultraviolet disinfecting solutions built on our [ platform ] last year is a shining example of the agility of our partner networks to solve problems. \n We're investing in engineering, support and marketing resources to make our MiR platforms even easier to build upon, which will enable the continued proliferation of high-value automated solutions to solve challenging problems for an expanding range of customers. Significantly, these development partners and customers provide great feedback on our R&D development plans. \n From a financial perspective, we expect IA will operate around the low end of our target profit range of 5% and 15%. We do expect IA to operate above the Rule of 40 in 2021, that is the sum of operating profit and revenue growth of over [ 40% ]. Longer term, when growth moderates, we expect the IA group to have a similar operating profit rate as our Test portfolio. \n Shifting to supply. We continue to manage through numerous supply constraints along with increased material, manufacturing and logistics costs in both our Test and IA businesses. For some products in both Test and IA, the supply constraints have extended our [ lead times ], and we're working closely with customers to minimize the impact of these delays. \n But we've been able to offset these higher costs through operating leverage with higher volumes and other cost-saving measures, so the cost increase impact on the P&L has not been material. We do expect to be dealing with supply line-related issues in Q3 and Q4 this year, which are reflected in our forecasts. \n Shifting to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our cash and marketable securities at the end of the quarter totaled $1.42 billion, $172 million of free cash flow in the quarter, $151 million and $17 million on buybacks and dividends, respectively. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 1.6 million shares for $197 million at an average [ price ] of $125.69 per share.\n Regarding our convertible debt. $15.6 million was paid in Q2 to convertible bondholders ahead of maturity. By the end of August 2021, bondholders will have already converted a total of $302 million, leaving a face value of $58 million outstanding. \n Looking at our operating model, I'd like to make 3 quick points. First, our performance over time. From 10 years ago, our gross margin percent has expanded from the low to [ mid-50s ] to nearly 60% [ today ] and our operating margin from the teens to low 20s to greater than 30% today. \n Second, our flexible business model shifts fixed cost to variable costs where appropriate through [ contract ] or outsourced manufacturing, variable compensation and other [ means ], which enables resiliency on the downside and is creative (sic) [ accretive ] when business is strong. \n Third, the operating leverage in the model is evident in our Q2 results. Our Test businesses are dropping through over $0.50 per revenue dollar through to the profit line in 2021... \nOperator: [Technical Difficulty] \nSanjay Mehta: Thank you. \nAndrew Blanchard: Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to have a quick transition. \nSanjay Mehta: I'll go back -- okay, it's Sanjay again. I'll go back to looking at our operating model. I'd like to make 3 quick points. First, our performance over time from 10 years ago, our gross margin percent has expanded from low to mid-50s to nearly 60% today and our operating margin from the teens to low 20s to greater than 30% today. \n Second, our flexible business model shifts fixed cost to variable costs, where appropriate, through contract or outsourced manufacturing, variable compensation and other means, which enables resiliency on the downside and is accretive when business is strong. \n Third, the operating leverage in the model is evident in our Q2 results. Our Test businesses are dropping through over $0.50 per revenue dollar through to the profit line in 2021, even while we continue to increase our R&D support -- and support investments to strengthen our Test business. This enables Teradyne to continue to invest in both our Test and IA portfolios. For IA, we are building a deeper product ecosystem and distribution differentiation while achieving the Rule of 40 in our IA portfolio. \n Now to our outlook for Q3. As Mark noted, the demand environment across the business remains strong. Our guidance assumes no significant changes, positive or negative, in the availability of materials and also assumes that we won't see additional pandemic-related issues. With that said, sales in Q3 are expected to be between $880 million and $960 million with non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.29 to $1.55 and 176 million diluted shares. \n Third quarter guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles and noncash imputed interest on convertible debt. Third quarter gross margins are estimated to be between 59% and 60%. OpEx is expected to run at 27% to 29% of third quarter sales. The non-GAAP operating profit at the midpoint of our third quarter guidance is 32%. \n Regarding OpEx for the full year. While we spent a bit lower than planned in Q2, we expect the full year OpEx will be about in line with the plan we described in April. We expect total operating expenses for 2021 to be about $1 billion or up approximately 19% from 2020. We recognize that we're on track to meet our 2024 earnings model this year. We'll update the model on a regular cadence in January after our detailed midterm plan income is complete in Q4 this year. \n In summary, our businesses are performing extremely well, delivering strong revenue and earnings growth while funding the investments that will drive future success. Our first half sales grew 21%, and non-GAAP EPS grew 29% above the first half of 2020, which itself was a record. We expect to deliver the highest Q3 sales and profits in history. \n Our employees and production partners around the world have delivered a record number of systems under challenging conditions. Our support teams have done whatever was needed to make our customers successful. And our engineering teams have kept the new product pipeline moving on schedule. It's been an impressive display of teamwork, and I'm proud to be part of this powerful Teradyne team. \n With that, I'll turn things back to Andrew. \nAndrew Blanchard: Thanks, Sanjay. And everybody, thanks for dealing with our small technical issue there. Phyllis, we would now like to take some questions. [Operator Instructions] \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Chin with Stifel. \nBrian Chin: A couple of questions here. Maybe just to kick things off. I'm just curious to what degree, if any, are the extended lead times in ATE in this sort of the current strong semiconductor environment impacting your shipment outlook or pattern in the second half? Obviously, Teradyne no longer discloses bookings, but your competitor appears to be building backlog into the December quarter. So I was wondering if you have better-than-typical backlog visibility beyond September. \nSanjay Mehta: Yes. So lead times have definitely been moving out. I'd say auto and industrial demand is still outstripping supply. But our lead times have pushed out, obviously, based on the very, very tight supply chain environment we're dealing with. And so what used to be, let's say, within a quarter has pushed out to 5, 8 weeks incremental to where we were in the past to be, in some cases, in the 20s in weeks of lead time. So with that, we have been seeing, I guess, improved bookings from our customers, and we're working with them to manage through it. \nBrian Chin: Got it. And then maybe for Mark. I think you touched on how, at least in the smartphone market, units are kind of a bigger tailwind this year, which hasn't always been the case in recent years. But I think in the 2022, what do you think -- to what degree could increased packaging complexity across foundries and maybe some IDMs be a more meaningful driver of incremental test intensity next year? \nMark Jagiela: Yes, we -- that's a good question. We bundle that into the complexity side of life. And there's already been advanced packaging technologies deployed for several years now in phones, but it's increasing. So that trend of multichip, multi-die packaging incrementally adds test time above and beyond what you would get if you were putting all of that silicon on a single integrated die. And there's not a good rule of thumb of how much of an adder it is, but it is a trend that's going to continue to grow and drive tests. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Atif Malik with Citi. \nAtif Malik: I have a similar question on the mobility side end market. It sounds like your mobility outlook has improved for the year versus 90 days ago despite millimeter wave weakness. You talked about units helping. Can you talk about the confidence in test intensity staying elevated for both mobility and compute into next year? And if you can also highlight the steps you're taking to improve your market share in the areas that you're not strong, like x86 GPU and display drivers. \nMark Jagiela: Yes. So I think the complexity trends looking even into the next year are all very strong and positive. In the case of mobility, the newer lithographies that are coming online are being widely adopted by the manufacturers of silicon for phones, which portends more transistors, which portends more test time. So that, looking into next year, all looks positive. And we get, at this point in the year, early glimpses of what the silicon for next year might actually look like. \n The -- on the compute side, similarly, we not only have the trend of lower lithography nodes, but the new interface standards related to LPDDR5 and DDR5, as I mentioned in my remarks, the early adoption of that has been pushed out a little bit as the processors that go with it have been delayed a bit. But all of the complexity required to run at those higher bandwidths is coming in 2022. So those are 2 positive things I look at that gives me confidence that this driver of complexity growth is definitely going to be strong next year. \n In terms of share, what we said before is that penetrating the traditional x86 GPU stalwarts is going to be a long-term endeavor for us that's going to hinge on some kind of technological discontinuity like that shift to DDR5 or like a shift to PAM4 interfaces to crack into. So that one is episodic and will play out over, let's say, 3 to 5 years. \n On the other front is -- are the emerging hyperscalers and new people coming into the market of creating complex silicon. These are automobile manufacturers, hyperscalers that we've talked about in the past, the Googles, the Facebooks, the Microsofts, the Amazons, that's where we're focused on getting a position to grow with them as they launch their products into the market in the shorter term. \nAtif Malik: Great, very helpful. And Sanjay, for you, the largest U.S. phone maker and your biggest indirect customer talked about supply constraints impacting smartphone sales in the September quarter yesterday. Have the materials and parts tightness gone worse over the last 90 days for your business? \nSanjay Mehta: Well, first of all, I won't comment on any particular customer, but I will speak in general about the environment. Last year, we were really working through demand increases, but we had fairly good, robust inventory strategies, and we are working through the impact of COVID. You have thousands of components that go into these testers, and we did a lot of resiliency improvements there. You fast forward to today's environment, and the demand has really kept accelerating. And the environment is tighter, I would say, today. And frankly, we don't see it letting up until the second half of 2022. \n So I think as the semiconductor industry goes through continued growth, you're seeing supply chains really getting tested. And then with the increase in the infection rates of COVID, especially, I'd say, in Southeast Asia, we're working through and managing the best we can. But I believe the net summation is it's a tighter industry now than it was, say, 3, 6 months ago. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. \nMehdi Hosseini: Two questions, one on ARM-based ASIC design. I'm trying to get a sense of how you see the TAM. You can either elaborate as a mix of SOC tests or perhaps you can tell us how is the test time for an ARM-based ASIC chip compared to like an app process or maybe that way we could give a sense of how demand looks like. So either qualitatively or quantitatively, you can -- if you can elaborate on ARM-based SOC test will be great. And I have a follow-up. \nMark Jagiela: Yes. So I guess the first thing I'd say is that a ARM-based high-end map processor, which is what's in most of our phones today, driving most of our phones, has a transistor count that's equivalent to any laptop, x86 kind of product you might have in your computer. And the test times comparatively between those 2 are not that different. It's kind of proportional to test count. \n The new ARM processors that are coming to market for compute applications, not smartphone applications, have perhaps anywhere from a 25% to 60% at or, on transistor count, above what's at the highest end of smartphones. And the test time associated with them, I would say, is proportionately longer at this point. And so I think it's, generally speaking, scaling with transistor count, and the transistor count on the ARM side is running a little bit at a faster clip than it is on the more traditional architecture side, if that helps. \nMehdi Hosseini: Sure. So the follow-up has to do with ARM-based. Actually, I want to just dig in a little bit more. Would you, at some point, break this out so we could better understand how kind of ARM-based SOC tester is tracking or scaling versus the rest of the SOC market? And number two, is there anything you can give us to better understand the competitive landscape for this specific application? \nMark Jagiela: Yes. I guess I haven't thought about trying to find a way to break out ARM because most of what mobility is, is ARM; and then there's, let's say, compute applications for ARM; and then there's some processors that are almost dual-use, and they go into either application. So I think it's fair to say that any compute business that we have at Teradyne is ARM-based compute. And perhaps maybe in the future, we can look at some way to sort of characterize both the market and our associated revenue for that. But I don't have a good number for you now on that. \n And in terms of the applications coming to market, in the short term, we know about the phone applications, we know about some early adopters of ARM for compute. Those are all coming to market or are in the market now. The hyperscalers that we're working with are coming into market at various points next year with products that are quite interesting but highly speculative as to whether they'll latch in the market. And obviously, I'm not going to talk about those because they're pretty confidential. But we'll see what latches. If one of these applications can become a 100-plus million unit application, which most of these design teams are targeting, then that's a significant adder to the market. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. \nVivek Arya: I was curious, how is your kind of visibility for Q4 as you kind of stand today versus what it is usually? And if you could give us some color by end market in terms of what is in your assumption for Q3 and the second half, that would be very helpful. \nSanjay Mehta: Sure. So Q4, if I look back at my last 2 years here, we've been surprised mainly on the positive side. And I'd say that given the tightness of supply and customers providing a little bit more in the way of backlog, it gives us a little bit more insight. However, obviously, in the near term, we have much stronger visibility in Q3 than in Q4. And so -- but we do have, I'd say, a little bit of incremental visibility. \n In color -- in your question in regards to color for Q3, we see continued strength in semiconductor. Obviously, the different components within Semi Test are going to be a little volatile, but we do see a trend down. It's still what we believe is very strong demand, but we see a trend down. And we see in our IA portfolio, really, a strength. Obviously, with the COVID impact in 2020, industrials are really coming back. I'll cite some PMIs in the 60s at the U.S. and Europe. And we really see that in our, as Mark noted, in our growth in the U.S. But we're seeing that growth in China as well as in Europe and the U.S. So continued expected growth in IA and then, from a test perspective, coming down a bit. \nVivek Arya: Got it. And then on the UR side, Mark, I'm curious, what are the top 3 applications you're serving today? And how do you expect these applications to evolve? You are maintaining a very strong growth rate in that business. And I'm curious, what is driving that. Is it more number of customers? Is it more applications within the same customer? So what's giving you the confidence you can maintain this very strong growth rate in the UR business? And is -- on the gross margin side, is it accretive? I know on the operating margin side, you've given a range. But I imagine on the gross margin side, it might be accretive to your business. \nMark Jagiela: Yes. It's interesting because there's no silver bullet as to what's driving the growth at UR. So for example, we're going to be up about 30% from revenue in 2019, 40% up from 2020. And in the script, I mentioned this application for welding, which is a brand-new application that is now driving about 6% of our sales for the year. Last quarter, I talked about this service application for servicing high-voltage power lines that's also running at around that 6% of sales applications that was nonexistent -- essentially nonexistent 2 years ago. \n So already, we have 12% of our growth attributed to new applications in new markets with new customers that we didn't have 2 years ago. So it's a combination of expanding applications like those 2 examples as well as established markets growing that's driving this. And our top 3 applications tend to be the same. It's automotive supply chain, it's industrial machine tending and it's electronic assembly tend to be the ones that are at the top of the pack. But frankly, they are shrinking as a percentage of sales as these new applications come online. \n So what gives me confidence looking forward is that ecosystem of partners who are developing these application solutions on our platform, not our competitors, is just continuing to grow and prosper. And they're not all going to be as successful as high-voltage line tending or welding. But it only takes 10% of them to fuel the kind of growth numbers that we've been seeing. And the activity there is very strong, and the technology is maturing to the point that more and more applications can economically be served. \n And over the horizon, when you look at what AI can bring, there's a whole new set of, let's say, features that will enable yet another expansion of the market. It's what gives us the confidence to talk about these kind of decade-long growth rates of 25%, 30%, 35%. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. \nJohn Pitzer: Mark, maybe another way to ask the calendar fourth quarter question is, over the last 3 years, the business has run in such a way that second half has been greater than the first half from a top line perspective, which has broken kind of a trend, where if you go back the prior 7 years, it was first half stronger than second half. Did you have any commentary on sort of how you think the second half over the first half looked this year just given how strong the market environment is and how tight test capacity is? \nMark Jagiela: You're right, perfect student of the history. And we have been, as Sanjay said, always a bit surprised in the recent years on how strong the fourth quarter has come in and driven second half to be a bit higher than first. So if you asked us today, we'd say first half is a little bit stronger than second, but that's no different than kind of what we thought for the last couple of years, too. And that just is a testament to the visibility in Q4 as -- the lack of visibility in Q4.\n As Sanjay said, though, it's a little bit more visibility now than before because lead times are a little longer. But all the upside that could come in is the, obviously, the piece that's not visible. So we feel probably better now about Q4 than we felt in any prior 2 or 3 years, but it's sort of what might happen between now and October that's invisible. \nJohn Pitzer: That's helpful. And then, Mark, as my follow-on, I apologize, the audio quality was a little poor during your prepared comments. I wanted to go back to some of the commentary you made around DDR5 adoption. I think the point you were making is perhaps it's a little bit slower than you thought. Is that correct? And I guess, more importantly, can you give us an update of how you think you're positioned for DDR5 when it does start to ramp relative to share in memory test? \nMark Jagiela: Yes. Yes, sorry about the audio quality. But in fact, yes, DDR5 for server applications has pushed out a bit as the server chips themselves have been delayed. We've seen the impact of that in the demand for DDR5 testers. And similar things happened with LPDDR5 going into mobility applications. So despite all that, the share position for Teradyne, we think, is unchanged from our earlier estimates at around 40% of the market, and it's going to be a tailwind next year when the DDR5  and LPDDR5 ramp as was originally thought would happen toward the end of this year. So we're well positioned there, and I think that's a tailwind for us next year. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. \nChristopher Muse: I guess first question, Mark, you've taken SOC test market size higher again. And I guess, curious, if we were to hit the high end of the range, what would be the driver there? And would your market share still be 48%? Or could you see greater contribution from what's driving potentially the market to the higher end of the range? \nMark Jagiela: Yes. Certainly, if the market goes up towards the high end of that range, our revenue would grow probably proportional to that. Would our share go much higher? I gave a number -- I threw in a number of roughly 48% at the midpoint of our market size guide. I would expect our market share is probably going to stay around that number, plus or minus 0.5 point at this point in the year. \n But it's hard to sort of prognosticate too much about where the share comes from. And as you know, one customer's buying capacity can swing multiple points of share in any given year. And so one of our customers could come in and drive a demand that we don't see right now. We have the manufacturing capacity to serve it. And yes, I guess we could be up at 50% share if that happened. It's just a little opaque at the moment. \nChristopher Muse: Okay. That's helpful. And I guess a follow-on question to a few of the questions that you got earlier. You spoke to DDR5 now being pushed to a tailwind next year. You've spoken to high-performance compute, particularly the non-x86 world as a tailwind for you guys next year. I think the concern out there is that your one large customer could decline meaningfully and that would cause SOC for you guys to be down next year. So I guess, as you sit here today and you're setting up your supply for customers and lead times have extended, how are you thinking about the world into 2022 for SOC for Teradyne? \nMark Jagiela: Very bullish because I think the concern -- let's see, I'm not going to speak too specifically around our customer. But what I would say is that the portfolio of devices that are being developed by our hyperscaler customers continues to expand. And that's going to -- in addition to the complexity growth of the existing portfolio, you add more chips on top of that, it portends a growing market, a growing customer. So there's going to be ups and downs, but I think the cataclysmic or sort of a cliff concern, we're now a decade into this almost, so -- and it just hasn't happened. So the trend line, I think, is pretty clear, and I think that trend line will continue. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. \nToshiya Hari: I had 2 as well. Mark, I guess somewhat related to C.J.'s question. Just curious in terms of the auto SOC test market, I think in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that you expect the market to exceed $500 million this year and now that's the highest mark since 2017. How are you thinking about sustainability there into '22? Near-term demand is clearly very strong. And when we speak with your customers, they're all kind of complaining about extending lead times. So I guess the bias is to the upside, but curious how you're thinking about that market. \n And then as a follow-up, a question on Storage Test. It seems like both HDD and SLT are trending very nicely. I think the business was up more than 2x last year in 2020. Curious what you're thinking about the business full year 2021. If you can differentiate between SLT and HDD, that would be super helpful. \nSanjay Mehta: It's Sanjay here. So I'll take a cut at them. So from an auto market perspective, it's true this year, we've seen tremendous growth and just about $500 million or plus or minus a bit from a market size, and yes, as far as we've seen even back to 2017. And fundamentally, I think in the last call, there was commentary around the auto industry, for years, has lived on a just-in-time manufacturing. And fundamentally, in back half of 2019, sales weren't so high. And coming into '20, obviously, demand has really picked up. And so you're seeing just a significant replenishment of inventory back into the system. And we're seeing that continue. We see, obviously, the lead times. And currently, the demand is outstripping our supply. And we see that good visibility until the end of 2021. \n 2022 will be interesting because we'll have to take a look at what are the inventory levels and what is the market demand in 2022 in first half. And so it's a little bit opaque, I'd say, in 2022, but it will depend on what I believe to be the inventory level and, obviously, the end market demand.\n And from a storage perspective, a little bit of color around 2020 and 2021. If I go back to 2020, HDD and our SLT business was kind of split relatively even. One was a little bigger than the other. And from an HDD perspective, we've seen continued end-market demand fueling that business. But when we look into 2021 from an SLT perspective, we're seeing a broadening of devices being adopted for SLT testing, which is providing a tailwind, which is enabling a larger growth in that segment of the storage business this year relative to the HDD business.\n So the HDD business is still very strong; end-market demand, very strong. But the broadening of the SLT -- or sorry, the ASICs being tested under SLT is increasing, which is really good news. So it's growing a little faster than the HDD shipments from a storage perspective. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. \nTimothy Arcuri: I had a question about your commentary, Mark, about your SOC share for the year and sort of what it implies for SOC in Q4, and more broadly, what it implies for total company revenue in Q4. So you've sort of given us all the different pieces. You guided wireless for the year, you guided systems for the year and you gave us the pieces on the Test businesses.\n So if I just look at what that implies for SOC in Q4, I mean you're going to do about $575 million roughly for SOC in Q3. That's not a big mystery. But the Q4 number implies it goes down to like $425 million, somewhere in the low 4s. That will be down year-over-year. So I guess my first question is like why would that be given that you have all this visibility? And obviously, you're quite bullish about the market. So why would Q4 be down so much? That's my first question in SOC. \nMark Jagiela: Yes. I don't know if it will be down so much or not. It's a portfolio of businesses, and all of those numbers have a margin of plus or minus, let's say, 1% around them. So that creates a large Monte Carlo simulation. And if you go right down the middle, I think you probably -- I'm sure you did the math right, that's probably what you come up with. \n But that's typical, as I said earlier, of where we stand at this point in the year looking into Q4 as in past years where it's come in higher. There's a significant unknown around what we'll book between now and through October that can drive Q4 shipments. And while we have backlog that extends in some product lines, as Sanjay mentioned, all the way through the end of the year, there's others that's more of a turns business. \n And we've positioned ourselves to be very responsive on the SOC front, in general, to capitalize on these sort of short demand request to come from our customers. That's why we've in the past been enabled to, in the quarter, exceed our guidance and even in the fourth quarter and prior years exceed what we thought when we were talking back then in July. \n So it could very well turn out that the demand that we've seen in the last couple of years in Q4 yet materializes again and we end up, as C.J. was hinting at, having a second half larger than first. It's just that at this point in the year, given what customers are talking about, we just don't see that as the most likely outcome. \n And it's episodic, too. What happens in Q4, a lot of it happens, in the past couple of years, in the December quarter, preparing for product launches that occur in February time frame, new phones and things like that. And so -- and again, with a rash of phone introductions in February, although we don't see it now, we could see a demand for SOC testers to support that driving December shipments. \nTimothy Arcuri: Yes. No, it's -- I mean the total company revenue is sort of implied to be below what people are expecting for Q4, so that's kind of why I was asking. \n So anyway, on your revised TAM for Semi Test, so can you just update us on the segment? So I think before, you were thinking compute would be $1 billion, mobility would be $1.6 billion. Auto, you just gave that number, is like $500 million. And industrial, I think before, you were talking about $500 million. So is the revision mostly in the compute side, can you sort of update us on those numbers? \nMark Jagiela: Yes. The numbers for compute are about the same. Mobility is probably up a couple of hundred million. Auto is up probably $50 million and industrial up about $50 million. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with Cowen. \nSreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: And Mark, thanks for the color earlier on the ARM test opportunity. I just want to ask the question in a different way. When do you think the non-x86 compute TAM or maybe the total test compute TAM be similar or bigger than the mobility test market? And then I had a follow-up. \nMark Jagiela: Bigger than the mobility test. So your question is when will the ARM compute test TAM be bigger than the ARM mobility test TAM? \nSreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: Yes, mobility test TAM is about $1.6 billion or $1.7 billion, and you said compute is about $1 billion. When do you think the total compute TAM or maybe just the non-x86 compute TAM get to be bigger than mobility? \nMark Jagiela: I don't think it's going to be in the next 4 or 5 years. I think much of what's being developed in the ARM space by the hyperscalers will more likely fall into the category of mobility. So I don't see compute growing beyond mobility in the next 4 or 5 years. \nSreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: Got it. Got it. And then, Mark, on the auto test market, you said it's over $500 million. I'm guessing that includes auto microcontroller, linear, et cetera. If that is the case, is there any way of giving some more color within that? Or you think it's too hard to segment it? \nMark Jagiela: Yes, it does include microcontrollers. And I would say that auto is outstripped -- most of the growth is auto more than microcontrollers. Microcontrollers is growing too, but it's mostly auto. Auto -- and of course, there's microcontrollers in auto. So when I say auto, I mean microcontrollers for auto versus microcontrollers, let's say, for white goods and things like that. \nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. \nJoseph Moore: I wanted to ask about the millimeter wave commentary. It seemed like the expectation was primarily one customer in one region. So when you say that was kind of short of your expectations, what are you referring to there? \nMark Jagiela: So it's not one customer, one region. Millimeter wave last year for us grew significantly. We probably had 90% share of the early buying per millimeter wave test in 2020. And I would say that was spread out across 6 or 7 customers. Anybody who's making a chipset related to millimeter wave was pretty much using a Teradyne tester in 2020. The deployment of millimeter wave by the telecommunication companies has ground to a halt. And that has proportionately ground to a halt the need for incremental test in 2021. \nAndrew Blanchard: Okay, folks, thanks so much for joining us today. That concludes the call. We apologize for the audio difficulties at the front end of it. We look forward to talking to you in the days and weeks ahead. And those in the queue, I'll get back with you directly here. Thank you. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day. You may all disconnect.",

            "name": "Mark Jagiela",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, I'll summarize our results for the second quarter and first half of 2021, update on current conditions in both Test and Industrial Automation, and comment on our view for the second half of the year. Sanjay will then provide the financial details on the quarter and our guidance for Q3. \n The strong demand we saw in Q1 accelerated in Q2 as both our Test and Industrial Automation groups grew substantially in the quarter. The long-term demand drivers we've discussed in the past continue to power demand for our products. In Test, it's device complexity and unit growth; in Automation, it's labor scarcity, the need for resiliency and productivity improvement. \n Opening further, performance at the company level from 2016 through 2020 saw our sales and non-GAAP EPS grow at a compounded rate of 16% and 32%, respectively. For the first half of this year, sales are running ahead of that rate at 21%, and non-GAAP earnings per share grew at 29% compared with last year. This demonstrates both the [ vitality ] of the markets we serve and the efficiency of our operating model. \n Significantly, in Q2, we saw Industrial Automation demand recover in all major regions, but particularly in North America. As a result, our production and [ operating teams ] operated at a high pace in Q2, and that pace is [ increasing ] in Q3. For the year, our IA business is on track to grow about 30% from 2019 and about 40% from 2020. \n Looking closely at the segment level. In Semi Test, SOC shipments grew 29% in Q2 from Q2 of 2020 with particular strength in both the compute and mobility end markets. For the first half, SOC sales grew 19%. For the first time in several years, smartphone unit shipments are helping growth in the mobility [ segment ], where as recent years have mostly relied on complexity growth. \n [ IA ] and compute are the 2 largest subsegments in SOC. Automotive, analog and industrial demand continues to be strong. The auto-related semi test market is expected to exceed $500 million this year, the highest level since 2017. This is despite the fact that automobile unit production will be about [indiscernible] lower in 2017 -- lower than 2017. A portion of this strength is test equipment. We're also seeing the impact of increased semi content and complexity per automobile, driving the test market. \n Our memory test shipments also grew in Q2 from Q2 of 2020, up 9%, led by flash tester demand. For the 6-month period, overall shipments were up 18% from last year on solid demand for both flash wafer and [ flash ] systems. This reflects significant growth in smartphone demand, the build-out of new memory capacity in China and the growth of SSD demand.\n Looking at the full year, we are again revising up the SOC market for 2021 to now be in the range of $4.3 billion to $4.7 billion with increasing strength in the x86 GPU and display driver segments. Recall that we have lower customer exposure in those markets with much of this incremental growth going to our competitors. So we'll likely see our SOC share around 48% for the year. \n In memory, at the macro level, our market estimates are unchanged with the test market this year expected to be about $1 billion and our share to be at about the 40% level. I will note that the expected ramp of DDR5 for server applications and the broader adoption of LPDDR5 is pushing out into 2022. \n Shifting to our System Test group, sales were up 26% in the first half compared with 2020, with strong Storage Test demand and a recovery in our Production Board Test unit driving the growth. For the full year, we see System Test group -- the System Test group grow in the 10% to 20% range. \n At LitePoint, sales in Q2 were up 12% over 2Q 2020. While 5G millimeter wave demand is lower than expected, the environment in Wireless Test is improving as we move through the year due to the continued WiFi 6 growth and early WiFi 7 investments. In addition, ultra-wideband adoption is increasing, adding a new growth vector for LitePoint. For the full year, LitePoint will likely grow in the 10% range. \n Moving on to Industrial Automation. The combination of expanding demand across our major markets and the increase in the range of tests served by our Universal Robots and MiR units drove group sales up 57% in Q2 last year [ to 45% ] in the first half. Compared to pre-pandemic 2019, first half sales are up 22%. Supply chain issues have constrained growth a little bit with lead times pushing out about 1 week. \n The demand environment for IA has recovered in most regions from last year's slowdown. America was the fastest-growing major region in Q2 with sales up over 90% from last year. Although we did see a [indiscernible] some countries in Asia where COVID has spiked in recent months, the second half of the year outlook is quite strong in all our major regions. \n Our long-term growth strategy in IA continues unchanged, and we expect long-term annual growth in the 20% to 35% range. This year, we will likely have a growth of about 40% from 2020, and we will continue to invest to enable this growth target of [ 15% ] gross margins, [ get ] a 5% to 15% operating margin during these high-growth years.\n From an investment perspective, we are expanding our engineering programs to shorten deployment times, increase the served market and improve the customer support experience. We are also growing our capacity to support distributors, integrators and UR plus and MiRGo apps development partners as [ they ] engage customers. We are also expanding our sales to OEMs that integrate our robots into their products. \n Last quarter, we noted the expanding range of applications for UR robots into the high-voltage line application with hundreds of [indiscernible] being deployed. Today, I'd like to highlight the success of UR+ plug-and-play applications for Industrial [ Automation ].There is a long-standing and chronic shortage of qualified welders worldwide with an estimated 100,000 unfilled welding jobs in the U.S. alone. While automated solutions exist for large applications like auto manufacturing, customers with lower volume and higher mix products are not well served by traditional automation. \n The integration of a force torque sensor into e-Series cobots enabled the precision needed for this application. And with UR+ [ integrating ] with our partners, we began serving this market about 3 years ago. During this time, welding applications have grown to be about 6% of our global [ sales ]and are on  [indiscernible] 1,000 cobots sold in 2021, more than tripling our 2020 pace. \n As we continue to extend the performance of our UR platform, we expect these high applications had growth vectors to traditional industrial applications. We have similar market-expanding initiatives in play on our MiR platform, but I'll save those details for a future call. \n Summing it all up, the first half of the year has been a strong sales, strong gross margins and earnings growth  [indiscernible]. Longer term, the markets we serve are showing [ increasing demand ] in a future global economy. The importance, pervasiveness and enabling capability of electronics in every [ aspect ] of our lives and industry is driving more fab investment, more complexity and more test. Likewise, the broadening application and fast [ ROI of ] [ collaborative ] robots in a world with labor shortages and productivity challenges is another growth trend. \n Strategically, we positioned ourselves in line with  [indiscernible]  and plan to continue to make [ System ] Test and IA as our full potential while driving world-class [ returns ]. While the rate of change in our markets is accelerating, we are well positioned to thrive as a company and to bring additional value to customers and shareholders. \n I'll now turn things over to Sanjay [ to provide ] additional color on the financials. Yes, we -- that's a good question. We bundle that into the complexity side of life. And there's already been advanced packaging technologies deployed for several years now in phones, but it's increasing. So that trend of multichip, multi-die packaging incrementally adds test time above and beyond what you would get if you were putting all of that silicon on a single integrated die. And there's not a good rule of thumb of how much of an adder it is, but it is a trend that's going to continue to grow and drive tests. Yes. So I think the complexity trends looking even into the next year are all very strong and positive. In the case of mobility, the newer lithographies that are coming online are being widely adopted by the manufacturers of silicon for phones, which portends more transistors, which portends more test time. So that, looking into next year, all looks positive. And we get, at this point in the year, early glimpses of what the silicon for next year might actually look like. \n The -- on the compute side, similarly, we not only have the trend of lower lithography nodes, but the new interface standards related to LPDDR5 and DDR5, as I mentioned in my remarks, the early adoption of that has been pushed out a little bit as the processors that go with it have been delayed a bit. But all of the complexity required to run at those higher bandwidths is coming in 2022. So those are 2 positive things I look at that gives me confidence that this driver of complexity growth is definitely going to be strong next year. \n In terms of share, what we said before is that penetrating the traditional x86 GPU stalwarts is going to be a long-term endeavor for us that's going to hinge on some kind of technological discontinuity like that shift to DDR5 or like a shift to PAM4 interfaces to crack into. So that one is episodic and will play out over, let's say, 3 to 5 years. \n On the other front is -- are the emerging hyperscalers and new people coming into the market of creating complex silicon. These are automobile manufacturers, hyperscalers that we've talked about in the past, the Googles, the Facebooks, the Microsofts, the Amazons, that's where we're focused on getting a position to grow with them as they launch their products into the market in the shorter term. Yes. So I guess the first thing I'd say is that a ARM-based high-end map processor, which is what's in most of our phones today, driving most of our phones, has a transistor count that's equivalent to any laptop, x86 kind of product you might have in your computer. And the test times comparatively between those 2 are not that different. It's kind of proportional to test count. \n The new ARM processors that are coming to market for compute applications, not smartphone applications, have perhaps anywhere from a 25% to 60% at or, on transistor count, above what's at the highest end of smartphones. And the test time associated with them, I would say, is proportionately longer at this point. And so I think it's, generally speaking, scaling with transistor count, and the transistor count on the ARM side is running a little bit at a faster clip than it is on the more traditional architecture side, if that helps. Yes. I guess I haven't thought about trying to find a way to break out ARM because most of what mobility is, is ARM; and then there's, let's say, compute applications for ARM; and then there's some processors that are almost dual-use, and they go into either application. So I think it's fair to say that any compute business that we have at Teradyne is ARM-based compute. And perhaps maybe in the future, we can look at some way to sort of characterize both the market and our associated revenue for that. But I don't have a good number for you now on that. \n And in terms of the applications coming to market, in the short term, we know about the phone applications, we know about some early adopters of ARM for compute. Those are all coming to market or are in the market now. The hyperscalers that we're working with are coming into market at various points next year with products that are quite interesting but highly speculative as to whether they'll latch in the market. And obviously, I'm not going to talk about those because they're pretty confidential. But we'll see what latches. If one of these applications can become a 100-plus million unit application, which most of these design teams are targeting, then that's a significant adder to the market. Yes. It's interesting because there's no silver bullet as to what's driving the growth at UR. So for example, we're going to be up about 30% from revenue in 2019, 40% up from 2020. And in the script, I mentioned this application for welding, which is a brand-new application that is now driving about 6% of our sales for the year. Last quarter, I talked about this service application for servicing high-voltage power lines that's also running at around that 6% of sales applications that was nonexistent -- essentially nonexistent 2 years ago. \n So already, we have 12% of our growth attributed to new applications in new markets with new customers that we didn't have 2 years ago. So it's a combination of expanding applications like those 2 examples as well as established markets growing that's driving this. And our top 3 applications tend to be the same. It's automotive supply chain, it's industrial machine tending and it's electronic assembly tend to be the ones that are at the top of the pack. But frankly, they are shrinking as a percentage of sales as these new applications come online. \n So what gives me confidence looking forward is that ecosystem of partners who are developing these application solutions on our platform, not our competitors, is just continuing to grow and prosper. And they're not all going to be as successful as high-voltage line tending or welding. But it only takes 10% of them to fuel the kind of growth numbers that we've been seeing. And the activity there is very strong, and the technology is maturing to the point that more and more applications can economically be served. \n And over the horizon, when you look at what AI can bring, there's a whole new set of, let's say, features that will enable yet another expansion of the market. It's what gives us the confidence to talk about these kind of decade-long growth rates of 25%, 30%, 35%. You're right, perfect student of the history. And we have been, as Sanjay said, always a bit surprised in the recent years on how strong the fourth quarter has come in and driven second half to be a bit higher than first. So if you asked us today, we'd say first half is a little bit stronger than second, but that's no different than kind of what we thought for the last couple of years, too. And that just is a testament to the visibility in Q4 as -- the lack of visibility in Q4.\n As Sanjay said, though, it's a little bit more visibility now than before because lead times are a little longer. But all the upside that could come in is the, obviously, the piece that's not visible. So we feel probably better now about Q4 than we felt in any prior 2 or 3 years, but it's sort of what might happen between now and October that's invisible. Yes. Yes, sorry about the audio quality. But in fact, yes, DDR5 for server applications has pushed out a bit as the server chips themselves have been delayed. We've seen the impact of that in the demand for DDR5 testers. And similar things happened with LPDDR5 going into mobility applications. So despite all that, the share position for Teradyne, we think, is unchanged from our earlier estimates at around 40% of the market, and it's going to be a tailwind next year when the DDR5  and LPDDR5 ramp as was originally thought would happen toward the end of this year. So we're well positioned there, and I think that's a tailwind for us next year. Yes. Certainly, if the market goes up towards the high end of that range, our revenue would grow probably proportional to that. Would our share go much higher? I gave a number -- I threw in a number of roughly 48% at the midpoint of our market size guide. I would expect our market share is probably going to stay around that number, plus or minus 0.5 point at this point in the year. \n But it's hard to sort of prognosticate too much about where the share comes from. And as you know, one customer's buying capacity can swing multiple points of share in any given year. And so one of our customers could come in and drive a demand that we don't see right now. We have the manufacturing capacity to serve it. And yes, I guess we could be up at 50% share if that happened. It's just a little opaque at the moment. Very bullish because I think the concern -- let's see, I'm not going to speak too specifically around our customer. But what I would say is that the portfolio of devices that are being developed by our hyperscaler customers continues to expand. And that's going to -- in addition to the complexity growth of the existing portfolio, you add more chips on top of that, it portends a growing market, a growing customer. So there's going to be ups and downs, but I think the cataclysmic or sort of a cliff concern, we're now a decade into this almost, so -- and it just hasn't happened. So the trend line, I think, is pretty clear, and I think that trend line will continue. Yes. I don't know if it will be down so much or not. It's a portfolio of businesses, and all of those numbers have a margin of plus or minus, let's say, 1% around them. So that creates a large Monte Carlo simulation. And if you go right down the middle, I think you probably -- I'm sure you did the math right, that's probably what you come up with. \n But that's typical, as I said earlier, of where we stand at this point in the year looking into Q4 as in past years where it's come in higher. There's a significant unknown around what we'll book between now and through October that can drive Q4 shipments. And while we have backlog that extends in some product lines, as Sanjay mentioned, all the way through the end of the year, there's others that's more of a turns business. \n And we've positioned ourselves to be very responsive on the SOC front, in general, to capitalize on these sort of short demand request to come from our customers. That's why we've in the past been enabled to, in the quarter, exceed our guidance and even in the fourth quarter and prior years exceed what we thought when we were talking back then in July. \n So it could very well turn out that the demand that we've seen in the last couple of years in Q4 yet materializes again and we end up, as C.J. was hinting at, having a second half larger than first. It's just that at this point in the year, given what customers are talking about, we just don't see that as the most likely outcome. \n And it's episodic, too. What happens in Q4, a lot of it happens, in the past couple of years, in the December quarter, preparing for product launches that occur in February time frame, new phones and things like that. And so -- and again, with a rash of phone introductions in February, although we don't see it now, we could see a demand for SOC testers to support that driving December shipments. Yes. The numbers for compute are about the same. Mobility is probably up a couple of hundred million. Auto is up probably $50 million and industrial up about $50 million. Bigger than the mobility test. So your question is when will the ARM compute test TAM be bigger than the ARM mobility test TAM? I don't think it's going to be in the next 4 or 5 years. I think much of what's being developed in the ARM space by the hyperscalers will more likely fall into the category of mobility. So I don't see compute growing beyond mobility in the next 4 or 5 years. Yes, it does include microcontrollers. And I would say that auto is outstripped -- most of the growth is auto more than microcontrollers. Microcontrollers is growing too, but it's mostly auto. Auto -- and of course, there's microcontrollers in auto. So when I say auto, I mean microcontrollers for auto versus microcontrollers, let's say, for white goods and things like that. So it's not one customer, one region. Millimeter wave last year for us grew significantly. We probably had 90% share of the early buying per millimeter wave test in 2020. And I would say that was spread out across 6 or 7 customers. Anybody who's making a chipset related to millimeter wave was pretty much using a Teradyne tester in 2020. The deployment of millimeter wave by the telecommunication companies has ground to a halt. And that has proportionately ground to a halt the need for incremental test in 2021."

            "name": "Sanjay Mehta",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll [ provide details ] on our Q2 results, comment on current business conditions and describe [ our outlook for ] Q3. \n Now to Q2. Second quarter sales were $1.086 billion with non-GAAP EPS of $1.91, up 29% and 44%, respectively, from Q2 '20. Non-GAAP gross margins were 59.6%, and our non-GAAP operating expenses were $250 million, but $5 million below the high guidance due to the timing of some nonrecurring engineering expenses.\n Non-GAAP operating profit rate was 36.5%. [ Gross margin ] in the quarter was [ 59.6% ] compared with our plan of 58%. The increase was tied to favorable product mix in the quarter versus planned. \n For context, Q2 2020 gross margin was approximately [ 56.2% ]. In April [indiscernible], we noted that this level of gross margin would continue in the near term, driven by the introduction of several key test systems in early 2020, which would [ take several ] quarters to come down the cost curve. These new product introductions, coupled with heightened costs driven by COVID shortages, were impacting our gross margins in 2020. One year later, we have now most of these test solutions at volume, and they have come down the cost curve as expected. \n The result contributed to higher margins in the second quarter, which we expect will continue in the second half of the year. A component of gross margin improvement over 2020 is higher revenue yielding of leverage in the gross margin line. We had one 10% customer in the quarter [indiscernible] excluding discrete items of [ 14.5% ]on both GAAP and non-GAAP basis. \n Looking at the results from a business unit perspective. [ Semi Test ] revenue of $834 million was up 27% from Q2 2020. SOC revenue was $742 million, up 29%, driven by strength in compute, mobility, industrial and automotive. Memory revenue was $92 million, up 9% from prior year, driven by strength in flash test and flash wafer sort segments. \n System Test group had revenue of $105 million, which was up 46% year-over-year. This is driven by $58 million in Storage Test sales, including both HDD and SLT solutions; [ $27 million ] in Defense & Aerospace and Production Board Test. \n In Storage Test, HDD and SLT demand remains robust as drive densities continue to increase and the number of devices adopting [ SLT spokes ]. At LitePoint, revenue of $55 million was 12% -- was up 12% from prior year due to continued strength at [ WiFi ], increases in [indiscernible] and ultra-wide band test market segments. \n Now to Industrial Automation. As we did in April, I'll provide revenue metrics comparing Q2 '21 results with both Q2 '20 and Q2 '19, so you'll have the full context given the impact of a contracting market tied to COVID last year. Industrial Automation revenue of $92 million was up 57% year-over-year and 23% over Q2 '19. Revenue expanded in all regions in Q2 [ over ] last year, with North America delivering the highest absolute revenue growth. U.S. and Europe represented about 77% of IA revenue in the quarter, with China contributing about 14%. \n UR sales were $76 million in Q2, up 75% year-over-year and [ 80% ] over 2019. MiR sales were $16 million, up 41% from Q2 '20 and 51% from Q2 '19. Recall, MiR had an  [indiscernible]  on Q2 '20 as its robots were widely deployed in automated COVID disinfectant applications.\n The longer-term outlook in our IA business continues to brighten. We expect continued labor shortages to drive new applications for both our fixed and mobile robots. Mark highlighted the shortage of welders and how that has opened up a new market for our UR cobots, but that is just one of many job categories with acute short-term and long-term labor shortages. \n Our strategy is to provide an open platform that creative developers can leverage to solve industry-specific labor shortages. The numerous filling ultraviolet disinfecting solutions built on our [ platform ] last year is a shining example of the agility of our partner networks to solve problems. \n We're investing in engineering, support and marketing resources to make our MiR platforms even easier to build upon, which will enable the continued proliferation of high-value automated solutions to solve challenging problems for an expanding range of customers. Significantly, these development partners and customers provide great feedback on our R&D development plans. \n From a financial perspective, we expect IA will operate around the low end of our target profit range of 5% and 15%. We do expect IA to operate above the Rule of 40 in 2021, that is the sum of operating profit and revenue growth of over [ 40% ]. Longer term, when growth moderates, we expect the IA group to have a similar operating profit rate as our Test portfolio. \n Shifting to supply. We continue to manage through numerous supply constraints along with increased material, manufacturing and logistics costs in both our Test and IA businesses. For some products in both Test and IA, the supply constraints have extended our [ lead times ], and we're working closely with customers to minimize the impact of these delays. \n But we've been able to offset these higher costs through operating leverage with higher volumes and other cost-saving measures, so the cost increase impact on the P&L has not been material. We do expect to be dealing with supply line-related issues in Q3 and Q4 this year, which are reflected in our forecasts. \n Shifting to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our cash and marketable securities at the end of the quarter totaled $1.42 billion, $172 million of free cash flow in the quarter, $151 million and $17 million on buybacks and dividends, respectively. Year-to-date, we've repurchased 1.6 million shares for $197 million at an average [ price ] of $125.69 per share.\n Regarding our convertible debt. $15.6 million was paid in Q2 to convertible bondholders ahead of maturity. By the end of August 2021, bondholders will have already converted a total of $302 million, leaving a face value of $58 million outstanding. \n Looking at our operating model, I'd like to make 3 quick points. First, our performance over time. From 10 years ago, our gross margin percent has expanded from the low to [ mid-50s ] to nearly 60% [ today ] and our operating margin from the teens to low 20s to greater than 30% today. \n Second, our flexible business model shifts fixed cost to variable costs where appropriate through [ contract ] or outsourced manufacturing, variable compensation and other [ means ], which enables resiliency on the downside and is creative (sic) [ accretive ] when business is strong. \n Third, the operating leverage in the model is evident in our Q2 results. Our Test businesses are dropping through over $0.50 per revenue dollar through to the profit line in 2021... Thank you. I'll go back -- okay, it's Sanjay again. I'll go back to looking at our operating model. I'd like to make 3 quick points. First, our performance over time from 10 years ago, our gross margin percent has expanded from low to mid-50s to nearly 60% today and our operating margin from the teens to low 20s to greater than 30% today. \n Second, our flexible business model shifts fixed cost to variable costs, where appropriate, through contract or outsourced manufacturing, variable compensation and other means, which enables resiliency on the downside and is accretive when business is strong. \n Third, the operating leverage in the model is evident in our Q2 results. Our Test businesses are dropping through over $0.50 per revenue dollar through to the profit line in 2021, even while we continue to increase our R&D support -- and support investments to strengthen our Test business. This enables Teradyne to continue to invest in both our Test and IA portfolios. For IA, we are building a deeper product ecosystem and distribution differentiation while achieving the Rule of 40 in our IA portfolio. \n Now to our outlook for Q3. As Mark noted, the demand environment across the business remains strong. Our guidance assumes no significant changes, positive or negative, in the availability of materials and also assumes that we won't see additional pandemic-related issues. With that said, sales in Q3 are expected to be between $880 million and $960 million with non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.29 to $1.55 and 176 million diluted shares. \n Third quarter guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles and noncash imputed interest on convertible debt. Third quarter gross margins are estimated to be between 59% and 60%. OpEx is expected to run at 27% to 29% of third quarter sales. The non-GAAP operating profit at the midpoint of our third quarter guidance is 32%. \n Regarding OpEx for the full year. While we spent a bit lower than planned in Q2, we expect the full year OpEx will be about in line with the plan we described in April. We expect total operating expenses for 2021 to be about $1 billion or up approximately 19% from 2020. We recognize that we're on track to meet our 2024 earnings model this year. We'll update the model on a regular cadence in January after our detailed midterm plan income is complete in Q4 this year. \n In summary, our businesses are performing extremely well, delivering strong revenue and earnings growth while funding the investments that will drive future success. Our first half sales grew 21%, and non-GAAP EPS grew 29% above the first half of 2020, which itself was a record. We expect to deliver the highest Q3 sales and profits in history. \n Our employees and production partners around the world have delivered a record number of systems under challenging conditions. Our support teams have done whatever was needed to make our customers successful. And our engineering teams have kept the new product pipeline moving on schedule. It's been an impressive display of teamwork, and I'm proud to be part of this powerful Teradyne team. \n With that, I'll turn things back to Andrew. Yes. So lead times have definitely been moving out. I'd say auto and industrial demand is still outstripping supply. But our lead times have pushed out, obviously, based on the very, very tight supply chain environment we're dealing with. And so what used to be, let's say, within a quarter has pushed out to 5, 8 weeks incremental to where we were in the past to be, in some cases, in the 20s in weeks of lead time. So with that, we have been seeing, I guess, improved bookings from our customers, and we're working with them to manage through it. Well, first of all, I won't comment on any particular customer, but I will speak in general about the environment. Last year, we were really working through demand increases, but we had fairly good, robust inventory strategies, and we are working through the impact of COVID. You have thousands of components that go into these testers, and we did a lot of resiliency improvements there. You fast forward to today's environment, and the demand has really kept accelerating. And the environment is tighter, I would say, today. And frankly, we don't see it letting up until the second half of 2022. \n So I think as the semiconductor industry goes through continued growth, you're seeing supply chains really getting tested. And then with the increase in the infection rates of COVID, especially, I'd say, in Southeast Asia, we're working through and managing the best we can. But I believe the net summation is it's a tighter industry now than it was, say, 3, 6 months ago. Sure. So Q4, if I look back at my last 2 years here, we've been surprised mainly on the positive side. And I'd say that given the tightness of supply and customers providing a little bit more in the way of backlog, it gives us a little bit more insight. However, obviously, in the near term, we have much stronger visibility in Q3 than in Q4. And so -- but we do have, I'd say, a little bit of incremental visibility. \n In color -- in your question in regards to color for Q3, we see continued strength in semiconductor. Obviously, the different components within Semi Test are going to be a little volatile, but we do see a trend down. It's still what we believe is very strong demand, but we see a trend down. And we see in our IA portfolio, really, a strength. Obviously, with the COVID impact in 2020, industrials are really coming back. I'll cite some PMIs in the 60s at the U.S. and Europe. And we really see that in our, as Mark noted, in our growth in the U.S. But we're seeing that growth in China as well as in Europe and the U.S. So continued expected growth in IA and then, from a test perspective, coming down a bit. It's Sanjay here. So I'll take a cut at them. So from an auto market perspective, it's true this year, we've seen tremendous growth and just about $500 million or plus or minus a bit from a market size, and yes, as far as we've seen even back to 2017. And fundamentally, I think in the last call, there was commentary around the auto industry, for years, has lived on a just-in-time manufacturing. And fundamentally, in back half of 2019, sales weren't so high. And coming into '20, obviously, demand has really picked up. And so you're seeing just a significant replenishment of inventory back into the system. And we're seeing that continue. We see, obviously, the lead times. And currently, the demand is outstripping our supply. And we see that good visibility until the end of 2021. \n 2022 will be interesting because we'll have to take a look at what are the inventory levels and what is the market demand in 2022 in first half. And so it's a little bit opaque, I'd say, in 2022, but it will depend on what I believe to be the inventory level and, obviously, the end market demand.\n And from a storage perspective, a little bit of color around 2020 and 2021. If I go back to 2020, HDD and our SLT business was kind of split relatively even. One was a little bigger than the other. And from an HDD perspective, we've seen continued end-market demand fueling that business. But when we look into 2021 from an SLT perspective, we're seeing a broadening of devices being adopted for SLT testing, which is providing a tailwind, which is enabling a larger growth in that segment of the storage business this year relative to the HDD business.\n So the HDD business is still very strong; end-market demand, very strong. But the broadening of the SLT -- or sorry, the ASICs being tested under SLT is increasing, which is really good news. So it's growing a little faster than the HDD shipments from a storage perspective."

After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Andy Blanchard. Thank you sir, you may begin.\nAndrew Blanchard: Thank you, April. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our discussion of Teradyne's most recent financial results. I'm joined this morning by our CEO, Mark Jagiela; and our CFO, Sanjay Mehta. Following our opening remarks, we will provide details of our performance for 2021's first quarter, along with our outlook for the second quarter of 2021. The press release containing our first quarter results was issued last evening. We are providing slides on the investor page of the website that may be helpful to you in following the discussions. Replays of this call will be available via the same page after the call ends. The matters that we discuss today will include Forward-Looking Statements that involve risk factors that could cause Teradyne's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statement contained in the earnings release as well as our most recent SEC filings. Additionally, these forward-looking statements are made as of today, and we take no obligation to update them as a result of developments occurring after this call. During today's call, we will make reference to non-GAAP financial measures. We have posted additional information concerning these non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure were available on the Investor page of the website. Looking ahead between now and our next earnings call, Teradyne expects to participate in technology or industrial-focused investor conferences hosted by Wolfe Research, ISI Evercore, Baird, Bank of America, Bernstein and Stifel. Now let's get on with the rest of the agenda. First, Mark will comment on our recent results and the market conditions as we enter the new quarter. Sanjay will then offer more details on our quarterly results along with our guidance for the second quarter, and we will then answer your questions. The call is scheduled for one hour. Mark.\nMark Jagiela: Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. In my remarks, I will summarize our Q1 results, review current market conditions and provide an update on how we are looking at Q2 and the full-year. Sanjay will then take you through the financial details of the quarter and our outlook for the second quarter. As you saw in our press release, our Q1 sales and profits grew double digits from Q1 of 2020's record level. Test sales grew 9% on broad-based demand with notable strength in automotive, industrial compute, memory and storage. Industrial Automation sales grew 33% in the quarter with strong demand at both UR and MiR. Notably, since our January call, the market demand in both Test and IA has been greater than we expected, as you can see from our Q2 guidance. In Semiconductor Test, customer orders are very strong as complexity continues to increase and chip units are expected to grow almost 15% this year, more than twice last year's rate. Regarding the sustainability of this demand, our visibility is limited to just a quarter or two but the growth in WFE from 50 billion in 2017 to 60 billion last year to over 75 billion this year should translate into a healthy tester market in the years ahead. Looking at SOC demand, the auto industrial segment is especially robust, with our Q1 Eagle shipments up nearly 90% year-on-year, and deliveries expected to grow further in Q2. Test demand for mobility and compute devices is also running ahead of our January estimates as these end markets push the performance limits of advanced process nodes and drive the highest complexity growth. This higher complexity drives longer chip test times and often demand's unique tester capabilities. Our UltraFLEX platforms are well aligned to these performance dynamics. As a result of this demand strength, we now expect the SOC test market to be in the $4 billion to $4.4 billion range, up about $700 million at the midpoint from our January estimate. This equates to about 16% growth from 2020, and we expect our share in SOC to be at about the 50% level. In memory test, we are seeing continued strength in both flash and DRAM. We now expect the full-year memory test market to be in the $900 million to $1.1 billion range, up about $100 million from our January estimate and up about 5% from 2020 levels. Our Magnum platform is in lockstep with the performance trends in both markets, and we expect another strong year in 2021. However, since most of the test market growth is expected to be wafer test applications, where we have less exposure, we are likely to see our share dip a few points into the upper 30s. In System Test, revenue grew 14% from Q1 2020, primarily on higher Storage Test shipments. As we have noted in past calls, Storage Test is linked to increasing density and complexity of data center hard disk drives and the expanding adoption of system-level test per chip test. Our full-year outlook for this business has improved from January as well on strength in both applications. The defense and aerospace and Board test units of STG are also performing well, and we expect the overall group will grow revenue 5% to 10% this year. Our LitePoint business is driven by the complexity of new wireless standards and the connectivity cellular and other wireless markets. In Q1, connectivity demand was the dominant revenue driver as WiFi 6E ramps in smartphones and access points. We expect LitePoint to grow in the 0% to 5% range in 2021. Shifting to Industrial Automation, we are on-track to grow 30-plus percent for the year. At the macro level, industrial economies are recovering with global PMIs above 50, indicating growing manufacturing investments. At the ground level, we are seeing increasing customer buying driven by economics, quality and lack of available shop floor labor. At UR, revenue grew 32% from Q1 2020 with a notable recovery in China where sales more than doubled in the quarter. Our China performance reflects the compelling value proposition UR offers, even in the face of low-cost competitors. We not only have the durability to operate in high-intensity production environments where downtime can't be tolerated, but we also offer a unique suite of organic and ecosystem provided software and peripherals to address a wide range of tasks with short deployment times. We are also seeing growth outside of the traditional manufacturing tasks. In the last several quarters, we have seen volume shipments of cobots to perform industrial service tasks, such as maintenance of high-power transmission lines while energized and robotic inspection of wind turbine blades. Together, these two applications account for over 500 installed cobots, and this should approximately double in 2021. Both examples highlight the flexibility of UR arms and value in performing dangerous service tasks. MiR also delivered strong results in the quarter, growing 55% year-on-year. A big part of that success has been the new MiR 250, which was introduced in March of last year and was our leading seller in Q1. We are also seeing a nice expansion of applications for mere products. Initially, most applications were moving goods to and fro. Last year, we saw a dramatic expansion in the use of MiR robots as a platform for mobile tasks such as disinfected workspaces. And now we are seeing growing use in the conveyor market where our mobile platform replaces fixed conveyors. This provides owners greater flexibility than traditional fixed conveyor system and allows them to reconfigure their factory on the fly as production requirements dictate. Although both UR and MiR, our expanding range of plug-and-play apps, now totaling over 430 in our UR+ and MiRGo ecosystem shortens the deployment time and increases the addressable market for cobots, adding additional growth factors for us. But we are not firing on all cylinders in IA yet. At AutoGuide, we have lowered our expectations for 2021. The this year, we will focus on expanding existing customer deployments while we complete a series of engineering projects designed to scale and win new customers in the future. While this is surely a reset at our AutoGuide plan, we remain confident in the potential of the nascent market for high payload autonomous mobile robots and our ability to leverage AutoGuide's unique product architecture to deliver differentiated value to this growing market. Rolling it all up, the demand environment in our test businesses has strengthened dramatically since January and the wafer front end equipment forecasts suggest that tester demand over the next few years will continue to grow. In Industrial Automation, UR and MiR are benefiting from their differentiated products and the improving global economy, which puts us on-track for a total IA group revenue growth of 30-plus percent for the year. Our employees are doing a great job, and our operating model is delivering strong financial profits and free cash flow. And finally, I would like to recognize and thank our Board chair, Roy Valley, who will be retiring next month after 20-years on the Teradyne Board. Roy's leadership, integrity and wise counsel have been invaluable to me and the executive team, and we all wish him the best in his future pursuits. Sanjay will now take you through the financial details. Sanjay.\nSanjay Mehta: Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Today, I will provide details on our Q1 results, offer additional color on the operating environment, along with our plans to address a very strong demand environment and describe our Q2 outlook. During the appropriate sections, I will provide some full-year expectations. Now to Q1. First quarter sales were $782 million with non-GAAP EPS of $1.11. Non-GAAP gross margins were 59.1% and our non-GAAP operating expenses were $230 million, above our high guidance due to high variable compensation and G&A expenses. Non-GAAP operating profit rate was 29.6%. We had two 10% customers in the quarter. Tax rate, excluding discrete items for the quarter, was 14.75% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Looking at the results from a business unit perspective, semi test revenue was $528 million, was up 9% from Q1 2021. SOC revenue was $420 million, up from prior year, driven by strength in compute, industrial and automotive markets, offset by a decline and our mobility shipments. Memory revenue was $108 million, up from prior year, driven by strength in flash final test segment. System Test Group had revenue of $133 million which was up 14% year-over-year. This was driven by $95 million in storage test sales, including HDD and SLT solutions and $38 million in defense and aerospace and production board test. At LitePoint, revenue of $41 million was above plan, but down about 6% from prior year due to lower cellular test shipments. Looking at our test portfolio overall. We are very optimistic about the market and technology trends unfolding over the midterm. The growing attach rate of electronics across the economy, the increasing complexity of those devices and significantly, a faster refresh rate for many of these complex devices benefit all of our test businesses. Looking at a significant example, the increasing number of companies creating high-performance processors to serve a growing range of end applications, each with unique performance and design cycles, is driving an estimated doubling of the compute portion of the SOC test market this year compared with 2018. We have designed our UltraFLEXplus platform to serve this growing market and are having early success. This trend has complementary impacts on memory and SLT markets as well. Now to Industrial Automation. Given 2020 was a contraction year; I will provide revenue metrics comparing Q1 2021 results with Q1 2020 and Q1 2019. Industrial Automation revenue was $80 million, was up 33% year-over-year and 21% over Q1 2019. Q1 2021 was a record for the seasonally soft first quarter of the year. U.S. and Europe represented over 70% of our IA revenue in the first quarter. As Mark noted, strength in China for UR, I will add that we saw the IA group revenue in China more than double year-over-year and grow greater than 50% over Q1 2019. UR sales were $66 million in Q1, up 32% year-over-year and 15% over Q1 2019. MiR sales were $14 million, up 55% from both Q1 2020 and Q1 2019. Sales increased in every region over Q1 2020. In addition to the success of MiR 250 that Mark noted, we also are starting to see a positive shipment trend towards higher payload MiR 500 and MiR 1,000 models, which should improve our ASPs overtime. Demand at both UR and MiR continues to improve as the global economy recovers and companies work to add production capacity. The opportunity of automation is growing. Our IA portfolio is solving problems for companies such as improving economics with a typical ROI of approximately one year, addressing labor shortages experienced by manufacturing and warehousing firms and adding supply chain resilience over the long-term. From a financial perspective in IA, we continue to lean into engineering, ecosystem and distribution investments to expand the range of applications in IA products - our IA products address and extend our global distribution reach. Our goal in the short-term is to balance investments with sales growth in order to deliver an annual IA group operating profit of between 5% and 15%. However, given the reset mark described at AutoGuide, we now expect Ag revenues of less than $10 million in 2021, and Ag will not be profitable in 2021. As a result, at the IA group level, we expect we will operate above breakeven in 2021, but below that target profit range. We do expect both UR and MiR each operate above the rule of 40 in 2021. That is the sum of the operating profit; revenue growth will be over $40 million. We continue to have confidence in our IA growth over the midterm, as articulated in our January earnings model update and expect the overall group to grow revenue over 30% in 2021. Shifting to supply. As Mark noted, the test market size has increased significantly across the board. From a supply perspective, we are dealing with increasing lead times and cost increases, predominantly in the semiconductor area. Given the significant demand increase in the challenging supply environment, we are experiencing some shipment delays. This is most acute in the automotive and industrial tester markets where demand is significantly outstripping supply. We are working with our customers on a daily basis to minimize the impact of these delays. We see this challenge accelerating into the third quarter with supplier lead times increasing. I appreciate the incredible pace of our operations team and partners around the world have operated for over a year and continue to be impressed with their efforts to meet the needs of our customers. To sustain that pace and create a more resilient operation, we are continuing to invest in manufacturing capacity around the world. This includes qualifying redundant suppliers, production sites for critical components and redundant manufacturing capacity in new locations. Shifting to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our cash and marketable securities at the end of the quarter totaled $1.43 billion. We had $1 million in negative free cash flow in the quarter and spent $45 million and $17 million on buybacks and dividends, respectively. To-date, $67 million of the RTI convertible bondholders have elected to convert early. And in Q1, we paid $51 million of it to the bondholders. Regarding the buyback, we plan to increase our daily buying throughout the year and expect to purchase a minimum of 600 million in 2021, as noted in January. The relatively low volume of buybacks in Q1 was planned for three reasons. First, recall Q1 is a seasonally high use of cash, where we typically pay out our variable compensation and ramp up our prepayments to support increased Q2 test production. Second, we wanted to understand how much of our convertible debt would be redeemed in Q1. Third, we wanted to confirm the global recovery from the pandemic remained on-track. Now to Q2. As you have heard this morning, customer demand is strong and in nearly all parts of the business, our guidance assumes that we will continue to be successful dealing with the numerous material shortages we noted earlier and that we won't see additional pandemic related issues. With that said sales in Q2 are expected to be between $1.01 billion and $1.09 billion, with non-GAAP EPS in a range of $1.62 and to $1.83 on 177 million diluted shares. The second quarter guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles and the non-cash imputed interest on the convertible debt. Second quarter gross margins are estimated at 58%. OpEx is expected to run at 23% to 25% of second quarter sales. The non-GAAP operating profit at the midpoint of our second quarter guidance is 34%. Regarding OpEx for the full-year. We now expect OpEx will grow 17% to 19% over 2020. Note that this is up from our January plan for 2021, where we guided growth over 2020 at 8% to 10%. The increase from January in order of magnitude is in three general categories. One, higher revenue-driving higher estimated variable compensation and higher engineering costs related to mitigating supply constraints. Two, higher incremental spending to accelerate several engineering projects in test and IA. And three, higher-than-expected G&A spending related to legal, insurance and IT costs. As we noted in January and included in the estimate, we expect travel and marketing expenses to increase through the remainder of the year as pandemic restrictions ease. As outlined last quarter, we set our sight on reaching $5.25 to $6.75 in EPS by 2024 in our earnings model. In 2021, we expect our largest end market, semi test, to grow 14% and at the estimated midpoint above the estimate in our earnings model. Combined with industrial end markets recovering from the pandemic slump, these data points reinforce that our midterm earnings plan is on a solid foundation. We update our earnings model each January. In our next update, we will look closely at both the WFE forecast and test growth rates. To sum up, the demand environment across nearly all of our markets remain strong, and we are working closely with our suppliers and customers to expand shipments and minimize the impact of material shortages. We have had an outstanding start to the year, and we are on a path to healthy sales growth and profit growth for 2021. At the midpoint of our Q2 guidance, we will see sales grow 19% and non-GAAP EPS grow 21% above the first half of 2020, which itself was a record. We are well on our way to achieving our midterm revenue and earnings goals we set in our new earnings model. With that, I will turn things back to Andy.\nAndrew Blanchard: Thanks, Sanjay. April would now like to take some questions. And as a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from C.J. Muse with Evercore.\nChristopher Muse: Thanks for taking the question. I guess first question, as it relates to the higher SOC test outlook, can you share with us what you are seeing in terms of arm gaining momentum in both servers and PCs and how we should think about that impacting your SOC test revenue growth and market share?\nMark Jagiela: Yes. I think it is a sub theme of what is happening in the compute area. The compute market for test this year will potentially double. Arm is eroding certain established share positions, and we are doing very well with arm. But I think we are still in early innings there. I don't think this is sort of the end; it is sort of the beginning. And the proliferation of other bespoke architectures that are high 10 billion plus transistor count devices is proliferating, at least in design. They haven't started to ramp yet, but they are being worked on in design. So it looks to me like over the next few years that compute segment just is going to be very strong.\nChristopher Muse: Very helpful. I guess as a follow-up, can you share with us your outlook for system-level test combined with HDD growth in 2021 and then thinking about the acceleration in nearline demand, how we should think about the growth CAGR there beyond 2021?\nMark Jagiela: Yes. I think the system-level test and HDD markets are both still on a growth trajectory. We had a big, big year last year. We didn't expect that we might have a little digestion this year, but no, it is still heading north. And I think on the HDD front, that one looks like line of sight for several years ahead is positive. The Exabyte growth in the 18-terabyte and above drive space just is very test intensive. And I don't see anything sort of blunting the transitions in the cloud storage to anything, but those high-intensity drives. SLT is a little more of a, I think, a lumpy market at this point. It could continue to sequentially grow, but it is still limited to very I would say, a small subset of the market, manufacturers building very high complexity devices in high volumes. Now engineering work is going on to make SLT more meaningful to lower complexity devices. And I think as those products come to market over the next few years, you will start to see customer expansion in SLT and the market will grow. But I would sort of say, I wouldn't be surprised to see plus or minus 25% year-over-year swings as we try to get to a broader adoption of SLT.\nChristopher Muse: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Atif Malik with Citi.\nAtif Malik: Congratulations on another strong quarter in guide. Mark, can you compare or contrast the mobility and compute piece at your largest customer, which was 25% of sales last year versus the 2018, 2019 period where you saw correction, obviously, the dynamics are quite different with 5G and now the compute piece this year?\nMark Jagiela: Yes. Unfortunately, I'm not going to be able to break down anything related to any customer's mix. So I can't address your question specifically. I do think though that the lumpiness compared to prior years has smoothed a bit because of the bigger portfolio of devices that are at play here. And one of the big revisions, I would say, to our market size estimate as we move through the year. I have always talked about and our largest customer, the demand profile becomes clear in April. And up until April, there is a lot of variability. And it is starting to become clear, and it is stronger than we had expected. So that is part of the story of what is driving up the market and our revenue this year.\nAtif Malik: Great. And as a follow-up for Sanjay. Sanjay, if you can comment on the M&A strategy from here on the last earnings call, you mentioned that even some areas in Semi Test are interesting to you guys. So just curious with the setback in the AutoGuide area, what are you thinking of M&A? Thanks.\nSanjay Mehta: Sure. Thanks. Yes. So as you know, M&A is to keep of our allocation strategy. And over the years, we have had a focus on industrial automation. We have an active business development organization that continues to look at different opportunities. And we will continue to do so. And we are spending time as a management team kind of reviewing them. And when an opportunity makes sense both financially and a strategic product fit, we will act and we will advise at that time.\nAtif Malik: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.\nVivek Arya: I think, Mark, you mentioned something interesting in your prepared remarks, which is that there could be some correlation between the rising front end WFE investments at some point; they will have a pull-through effect on testers. I'm curious, what have been your impressions over this correlation from a historical perspective? Because this year will be kind of the second very strong year for WFE and that are expectations for almost 30% kind of growth this year. When do you see that impacting the demand for testers? Does it happen with a six month lag, does it happen with a one year lag? And what is the kind of - should we be expecting a 30% growth in testers next year, right? So just curious what you think the correlation is?\nMark Jagiela: Yes. So there is a correlation and a lag, as you alluded to. So front end equipment usually goes into fabs, there is a period of time then after all of that is installed. Revenue gets recognized on behalf of those equipment makers and the fab gets tuned. The recipe, the yields and things before the fab has put into commission for real customer shipments. So that can take anywhere from - the good suppliers these days maybe get through that phase in about three to four months. But then it is not a light switch that turns on. It is more like a knob on a faucet because you start to ramp wafer outs slowly and you proportionately start adding testers. So what you can expect to see is, let's say, maybe the beginning of tester orders lag four to five months, but they really get going kind of a year after the fab equipment goes in. So if you offset the tester market from the fab investments by about, let's say, a year plus or minus three months, you get a good indication of growth. Now if you go back for the past five years, you will see there is been pretty steady monotonic growth in WFE and there is been pretty steady monotonic growth in the tester market. I think the most recent step, though, from 60 to 70 plus is larger than we have seen historically. So if all of that happens and it is truly put into commission, I would expect it to be something that pulls up the growth rate a little bit higher than we have seen in the past. But the one caution I would add is that what drives test again is transistor count, which we sometimes call complexity, but it is transistor count. And the capital intensity to build transistors at three nanometers and such on a per transistor basis is getting to be quite high. So it may turn out that it takes more CapEx per transistor at some of these nodes than it has historically. So that could mute a little bit the cause and effect. If you follow what I'm saying, but overall, the big, big picture is, you are right, it is correlated. Maybe it is a year plus or minus three month delay.\nVivek Arya: Got it. And for my follow-up, maybe one for Sanjay on the cost and the operating leverage perspective. So on the cost side are you seeing any rise in your input costs and what are you doing in response? Are you passing those along and will those be sticky overtime? And then kind of part B of that, I think, Sanjay, you mentioned operating expenses could grow 17% to 19%. Do you think when you grow OpEx that much, there is still leverage left in the model that could sales also grow in that neighborhood somewhere this year?\nSanjay Mehta: Sure. So first on the cost of sales, yes, we have seen certain cost increase. Raw materials, semiconductor components, et cetera. And fundamentally, we have been able to manage through those. And we expect, from a full-year perspective, we will be at model from a gross margin, 58% to 59%. And so we are just kind of managing through those cost increases. And from an operating expense perspective, yes, we are seeing a lower operating leverage in Q1, really some OpEx increases, but really throughout the year, you should expect to see us improve our operating leverage throughout the year.\nVivek Arya: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.\nMehdi Hosseini: Mark, I just want to go back to your earlier comment regarding transistor. It is interesting in your press release last night, you also talked about a smartphone unit as contributing to upside to SOC Test growth. So in that context, test growth. So in that context, can you please help us understand how smartphone unit growth and transistor density are driving the SOC Test growth or which one do you think is going to be a bigger factor this year versus 2020? And I have a follow-up.\nMark Jagiela: Okay. Good question. Obviously, they are related, they are correlated. But for example, in 2020, we saw a dramatic increase in the tester market when cell phone units weren't growing. And that was all driven by complexity growth. So you can see the power of complexity growth alone by examining 2020, it is big. Now in 2021, interestingly, we are getting a year where the, I would say, complexity growth of the silicon going into phones is less than it was in 2020, but that is been more than offset by the fact that units are going to grow. So now we have units working for us a little more in a year where complexity, it is going up, but not as dramatically as it did last year. So it is almost a multiplicative effect of the two. And this year is really a story of both, but I would say without the unit growth, we would be looking at a smaller market, a smaller overall TAM than we are seeing.\nMehdi Hosseini: Got it. And just moving on to system test, what is the mix between SLT and HDD and how are each one of these two pieces growing on a year-over-year basis. Thank you.\nSanjay Mehta: Yes. Mehdi, it is Sanjay here. It is roughly a 50/50 split, plus or minus a bit. And as Mark indicated, from an HDD perspective, really strong end market growth and SLT, there is some investments going to expand that market. But we see growth in both.\nMehdi Hosseini: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.\nToshiya Hari: Hi good morning, thanks for taking the questions. Mark, I wanted to ask about your market share traction in memory test. 2020 was a very strong year for you guys. Particularly in DRAM package test. You talked about customer mix or spending mix this year, driving maybe a little bit of a decline year-over-year. But in terms of customer pull and your expectations through cycle, what are you seeing in memory test right now?\nMark Jagiela: Yes. So memory test is strengthening. At the midpoint of the new market estimate, it will actually grow compared to last year, which again was a good year. It is the sort of areas that are growing, some of them were participating in and some of them were not. So China is growing dramatically, and we are doing very well in China. So we are seeing good pickup there of the products in both flash and DRAM, and we are gaining market share. In other geographies where DRAM is growing, the piece of the DRAM market, final test for LPDDR5 that we targeted our new product for and have a design wins. That is also looking very good and growing. But what is growing even faster is wafer test for DRAM, which is an area we really don't participate. It tends to be a low technology tester product that serves that market; it is not a big profit pool. And because of that, I alluded to the fact that our share might drop from 40%, 41% down to maybe 38%, 39% for the year.\nToshiya Hari: Got it. That is helpful. And then as a quick follow-up, I just wanted to go back to the AutoGuide reset. And sorry if I missed this, Mark, but what has changed in that business over the past three to six months and perhaps more importantly, does this change how you think about your growth strategy, our M&A strategy within overall IA? Thank you.\nMark Jagiela: Yes. It doesn't change anything about our thinking on M&A and growth strategy in IA just to sort of take that one first. And over the course of many acquisitions we have done in the past 10-years, we have had various levels of success, I would say. The bigger acquisitions like the Nextest, the Eagles, the URs and the MiRs of the world have gone really, really well. And some of the smaller ones have taken longer to realize their potential than we expected at the beginning. And so AutoGuide is a case where we are kind of in that same situation. We started out last year, deploying the product into multiple big name, high potential accounts. And we are sort of lilly pad - lilly pad getting these initial deployments up and running. As we reflected back on where we stood, we were getting overextended on new accounts where the current accounts potential could be jeopardized by not doing more to augment the product with the ability to dock into other factory automation systems that these customers are implementing. So we have just decided, let's retrench around the five or six big accounts we have today, get them rock solid, develop these linkages to warehouse automation, manufacturing systems, strengthen our linkage to our MiR product line, so we have more of a seamless connection there. And just grow within those accounts and then go on to a more expensive footprint. So it is absolutely not what we planned a year ago when we acquired AutoGuide. But in the light of today, the opportunity looks so large that we think better off taking this task than just trying to proliferate more and more accounts.\nToshiya Hari: Makes sense, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from John Pitzer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nJohn Pitzer: Good morning guys. Congratulations on the solid results. Sanjay, I just want to go back to your commentaries around supply constraints and duration. It sounds like from your prepared remarks, that this is going to last at least into the calendar third quarter. Do things get worse from here? Is there any way to quantify the impact it is having to your revenue and usually, when customers can't get what they want, they tend to order more than they need. So how are you safeguarding against the inevitable sort of double ordering and excess build out?\nSanjay Mehta: Yes, great question. So we are seeing shortages, and we have been able to - through our inventory strategies as well as multiple suppliers been able to work through them. Fundamentally, in the rise of the demand in 2020 and through COVID and then in [2020] (Ph) in Q1. We are seeing it in Q2, and we see it getting supply getting tighter. We are seeing lead times increase from our suppliers across the board. And we are booked out pretty much for the year. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we are spending more engineering dollars and qualifying different suppliers. So it is getting tighter as demand continues to increase throughout the year. And Q2, we feel pretty good about where we are at in the range. Of course, there is always things we are managing. But Q3, we see it getting tighter. Visibility, we have good visibility into Q3, some issues we are working through. And then Q4, the visibility, obviously, further out, it goes down. I would say on the duplicate orders perspective, I don't really see in the demand statement, a whole set of duplication of orders. We are working with our customers, we are understanding their specific needs and working to get them what they need and just working through that.\nJohn Pitzer: That is helpful. And then, Mark, as my follow-up, clearly, a lot of conversation coming out of Washington about trying to get more domestic front end production inside the U.S. if the goal here is to kind of secure the supply chain, it seems kind of silly to build a wafer here that you have to then ship over to Asia to test and package. I'm just kind of curious from your perspective, are you seeing any drive towards sort of regionalization test capacity, what might that mean for your business in the future and maybe beyond even Semi Test, are you seeing across other supply chains, sort of a redomiciling of that supply chain that might actually help your IA business.\nMark Jagiela: Yes. So I think there is a lot in what you just said. It is interesting and also possibly a deterrent to these regional fabs because a regional fab is, in my view, meaningless without the associated infrastructure around it, including test, supply of the chemistry, the local supply thing makes the whole venture economical. And as an alternative to doing everything in Taiwan, if you want to do in the U.S. or Japan or Europe, you really need a competitive infrastructure to get it done, so it will necessarily require test if it is not going to be an orphan. And I'm a little bit skeptical, will all of these jurisdictions have the 10-year sort of intestinal fortitude to move forward and invest in that kind of infrastructure build-out. But I think in the U.S. case, my read is that the answer is probably yes. The national security issues, there is just a lot behind this that suggests it is probably going to happen. And in the case of test and robots as well, I think the fracturing of the supply chain to be more geographically dispersed, on the one hand, maybe for a global economy is a little bad because it creates some inefficiency in the market, but for a supplier of equipment into that market. It is a helpful, it is a tailwind. And so I do think you are going to find probably globally a little bit less utilization efficiency of equipment because of this trend. But the national instincts around secure supply chains are going to overdrive that and probably subsidize it to some level. And I think both of our businesses will be a beneficiary of that.\nJohn Pitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Timothy Arcuri with UBS.\nTimothy Arcuri: Hi, thanks. I guess a couple of things. First, Mark, I think you said that compute. So I guess my question really is for you to break down what the Semi Test TAM, if I take your $4.2 billion midpoint this year for SOC. I'm just wondering if you can break that down. I think you had said last year, of the 3.45 billion, it was like 600 million compute and so I'm wondering, out of the 800 million that is going to grow this year from 3.45 billion up to 4.2 billion. I'm wondering if you can kind of break that down. It sounds like most of it is compute because you said compute is going to double from 600 million last year. But I'm just wondering if you can sort of reset the segments for us as well.\nMark Jagiela: Yes. I will give you some rough numbers, but take it a little bit with a grain of salt because here we are three months later, talking about a big revision to our view of what the market size is. So I don't profess to be overly wise on this. But our current view on compute would be about $1 billion-ish market this year, for example. So not quite doubling, the year is not even halfway over. So who knows what could happen, but that is our current view. Mobility compared to last year is probably flattish, could be down a little bit compared to last year. The one part of mobility we haven't talked about that of all the places that are surging for demand, there is a pocket where demand is softer this year and that is in millimeter wave test capability. And last year, there was a lot of tooling for millimeter wave as some of the phones were early adopters of millimeter wave technology. But the fact of the matter is that telcos globally aren't deploying millimeter wave to any large extent spotty deployment in the U.S. and almost nothing outside of the U.S. And so that is suppressing demand this year for millimeter wave test equipment. That makes the - it is a little bit of a headwind for the mobility market. So call it flat to slightly down in mobility. At about, let's say, it is about 1.6 billion or 1.65 billion or so. The automotive and MCU market is closer to 450 for the year. That is up from about 225 last year, so big, big jump there. And the last segment that we sort of track is industrial, and that one is up to about 500 million from maybe 340, 325 last year. So that is how we segment it right now.\nTimothy Arcuri: Awesome. Awesome, thank you. And then I guess I just wanted to maybe push back a little bit on the correlation between WFE and Test TAM. It is been a little more consistent in memory the past couple of years, of course, when you get these big pricing swings, that is going to probably go away. But on the SOC side, wouldn't you agree, your big customer is a significantly larger portion of the SOC Test TAM than they are of consumption in the front end non-memory WFE world. So doesn't the SOC market depends a lot more on what the large customer is doing in the test world than in the WFE world. So the correlation in SOC could sort of break down a bit because of what the large customer is doing. And I guess on that point, they've never been good three years in a row, not once, and this is the second big year. So how do you handicap the odds that next year is a big down year and that works against you in terms of share, even if the market doesn't come down that much? Thanks.\nMark Jagiela: Alright, a lot in there Tim, but I will try to take it on. So your point about the large customer or our large customer, never having sort of as a proportion of our revenue, three big years in a row. I think there is truth to that, but there is also a difference in what is happening, because the portfolio there is growing. If you go back to the sort of 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 area, it was kind of one device type that was driving the story and the demand. And now we are into a much broader portfolio, so I would just offer that that dynamics changed. And that is a fact that could propel this more sequential growth for a longer period of time. On the correlation between WFE test, SOC Test demand and whether that is stronger than who's buying, let's say, certainly, customers have different test intensities. And so part of the noise that is running under the hood, certainly as it relates to our revenue is related to large high test intensity customers and how much they are buying. We are fortunate that we participate in segments of the market that tend to have high test intensities, but that is by design. We target those segments. And it is not just one large customer that produces devices that have high test intensity. There are others, and that is where we play. So I would agree with you that if the market shifted away from high test intensity customers meeting high complexity devices, you could see a disconnect an anchor on the test market that was disconnected from WFE. But it just doesn't seem likely because the reason these investments are being made in the front end. And the reason they are so expensive to make is that they are going after three nanometer EUV lines to build devices for these very customers we are talking about. So I just don't see that the disconnect can emerge unless the fab sit idle. If the fabs are going to say, idle, yes. But if the fabs aren't going to be idle, it is the exact customers we are talking about that are going to utilize them. So I don't disabuse your point. It actually has some merit, but I just think the correlation, almost by definition, has to occur unless the fabs are idle.\nTimothy Arcuri: Okay. Awesome Mark, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Krish Sankar with Cowen.\nKrish Sankar: Yes, thanks for taking my question. And Mark thanks for the color on the SOC Test. I just wanted like focus on the compute test market and it looks like you said it is going from 600 million to one billion. Is the incremental growth all coming from custom silicon and if that is the case, can you just tell us how much your market share in compute was last year and how much do you think it is going to be this year? And then I have a follow-up.\nMark Jagiela: Yes. So most of the growth is, I would say, coming - what is it non custom silicon, I couldn't say that. I think growth is coming from the nontraditional suppliers of compute devices is a disproportionate amount of it. But the other usual suspects are growing too. AMD, obviously, is growing and NVIDIA is obviously growing. So it is broad-based. But as a proportion, I would say, yes, you are right. It is probably some of the newer players that are growing the market faster than others. And as to our share position, historically, our share in compute has been below our overall market share. So maybe in the 30s and moves around in the 30s is where it is been. We are trending into a period of time because of this change of who is building these devices where our share is more likely to move up closer to our overall average share in the market. So if our SOC average share is somewhere in the 50-ish range, it might take a little bit of time, but that is kind of where we are trending to.\nKrish Sankar: Got it that is really helpful, Mark. And then just a follow-up, I think you made a comment that you are kind of booked out for the rest of the year. Is that a Semi Test and a Storage Test comment and if so, should we assume that you would not see seasonality in the back half in Q4 because the demand is strong or in other words, it is your Q2 Semi Test revenue run rate sustainable?\nSanjay Mehta: It is Sanjay. So I made the comment that we were booked at, and it was really tied to our supply perspective. We are working with both contract manufacturers and our direct suppliers to fundamentally make sure that we have orders on the books until the end of the year, just given the supply constraints environment.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Thanks Sanjay.\nOperator: Your next question is from Brian Chin with Stifel.\nBrian Chin: Hi there, good morning and thanks for letting us ask a few questions. First, on the Semi Test business, I definitely respect that visibility in this or any year has limitations. But if I do take the midpoint of your new expectations for the test markets, take your market share projection and assume the majority of the second quarter growth will be Semi Test driven. I think I back into about a 10% or so sales decline in Semi Test in the second half of the year. Am I kind of in the ballpark here and to what extent is your backlog coverage supportive of this?\nSanjay Mehta: Yes. When you take a look at the numbers, overall, maybe I will comment overall. We are expecting to see, given the visibility and obviously, with a significant reset of the market size, and as we move throughout the year, the lack of visibility in the second half. But with all of those provisions, we are seeing overall an expectation that the second half of the year revenue will be slightly down, both for the enterprise. And that is a similar direction down for Semi Test.\nBrian Chin: Got it, thanks Sanjay. And then maybe just on the industrial automation business and sorry if I missed some of this, but I definitely heard about China as a geography showing strong year-over-year growth a lot of growth in MiR and a snapback in the UR business as well. Can you characterize maybe Europe and North America; obviously, key markets as well sort of where are they in terms of their snapping back relative to where you might expect them to get this year?\nSanjay Mehta: Yes, hi it is Sanjay. Yes. So from a U.S. perspective, we are seeing the snapback, whether you look at increases over Q1 of 2019, pre-COVID year or even Q1 of 2020, similar with Europe, a very strong kind of double-digit snapback over either year.\nBrian Chin: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.\nJoseph Moore: Great, thank you. I wonder if you could talk about in the automotive and the broader markets. The degree to which test is one of the bottlenecks they are dealing with, like we hear about shortages on wafers packaging, a little bit test just how severe do you think your bottlenecking them and then when you look at a 90% comparison in auto, it would seem like there is some catch-up in that, like does that create sustainability risk in your mind maybe next year?\nMark Jagiela: Yes. I think the big issue is wafers, not in terms of bottlenecking, the automotive manufacturers. That doesn't mean that we are completely aligned on deliveries for test equipment to the chip suppliers who are trying to ramp shipments. We are misaligned by a few weeks here and there. And we are pulling like mad and they are pulling like mad. But the big, big, bigger issue is getting wafer capacity. So we are not in the headlights quite yet, but we are certainly in intense conversations to try to pick up a week or two here or there so that they can get a little bit more out a week or so sooner.\nJoseph Moore: Great and absolute level you have.\nMark Jagiela: Automotive always kind of goes in fits and starts. And I think the supply chain in automotive is going to come out of this, having learned a lesson that they can't be so lean on just in time. And I know that raises the specter of everybody's worry that there is inventory being going to be built in addition to real line demand. And I think that will happen. That is certainly not happening yet, that is to come. So there is going to be a phase here where we get through the urgency, then there will be investments made to build more, I would say, slack in the system for the devices that go into automotive. So that will be a bit of a balloon. But then it will settle back to, I think it is normal rhythm. Where increasing electronic and chip attach rates in automobiles will drive the market. And we are going to get to kind of a peak level of test investment in automotive this year, close to that $500 million number. And that could even - certainly, I think it could sustain through the end of the year because of this inventory catch up. But my guess is as we get into the 2022 area and beyond, it will sort of back into oscillating between the 300 million to 500 million range.\nJoseph Moore: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Blake Gendron with Wolfe Research.\nBlake Gendron: I want to come back to the Arm's SOC commentary, not from a market share perspective, but rather the complexity discussion. Because as we have seen large customers accelerating this Arm's rollout here a bit. So it seems like the architecture consolidates the number of wafers for various compute functions, simplify the circuit a bit. So share opportunity is notwithstanding. I'm wondering what the complexity in test intensity puts and takes are with this arms trend specifically?\nMark Jagiela: Yes. That is a little tricky. So first of all, let me say that most of the applications processors in your phone, which is a 1.5 billion unit market, are Arm-based processors. And those devices in the high-end phones, which comprise maybe 400 million to 500 million units out of the 1.5, have transistor counts on par with any desktop or laptop computer you might buy, 10 billion-plus kind of transistors. So when you look at the test intensity there compared to a traditional microprocessor, it is a little bit more efficient, I would say than the traditional microprocessor, but not a lot, more efficient. So for the same, let's say, 10 billion transistor x86 architecture compared to a map device in your phone, maybe it is at 90% versus 100% kind of test time delta, so not big. Now when you get into Arm-based compute devices for more non-phone applications. There is different cash requirements, different IO technologies needed that further complexify the Arm implementation that bring it back up to test intensity is very similar to the x86 world. So I don't see a big difference there.\nBlake Gendron: That is really helpful and then a follow-up on industrial automation. You noted peripheral services that demand additional software apps and likely hardware. We have seen a bit of proliferation of companies that are attacking things like computer vision, machine learning other AI capabilities. So wondering what kind of artificial intelligence capabilities Teradyne has in IA to keep up with these trends. It seems like robotics peers, both large and smaller really descending on the cobot space here. Or could this be a focus of M&A moving forward?\nMark Jagiela: So it is certainly in our M&A funnel, there is various opportunities like that. But what I would say is that many of the startups in the IA and machine learning space that are exploring ways to enhance robots, cobots, are doing it on our platform as a partner. If you go into our again, UR+ ecosystem or a MiRGo ecosystem, you will see a variety of machine learning and AI tools. That have been targeted and customized for our products. So we are benefiting from them whether we own them or not. We do have organic IA products that we have on our MiR platform already. But it is going to be important for the evolution of ease of use and applications expansion for cobots, for sure. And whether we need to own it, or whether we need to be the preferred platform that they all write their apps for, I think, is still kind of a case-by-case consideration for us.\nBlake Gendron: Very helpful. Thank you.\nAndrew Blanchard: We are just about at the limit, but we can sneak one quick question in, if you would, April, please.\nOperator: Okay. And your last question is from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank.\nShek Ho: Thanks for taking my question. Can you give us an update on your revenue opportunity related to 5G for both SOC Test and LitePoint? And maybe in the 5G infrastructure side, are you seeing a recovery of that market in any region right now?\nMark Jagiela: Yes. I think infrastructure is really not driving much tester demand generally. It did for us back in 2019 when China was going crazy, rolling out sub-6G and Huawei was investing heavily at the time. But the kind of what is now a $5 billion tester market, infrastructure, 5G investments are, I think, always going to be sub-100 million and maybe more in the sort of $60 million to $70 million range. The bigger one is what happens with the phones and the terminals and such. And there, the U.S., the spectrum auction around sub-6G is concluded. I think that carriers are kind of clearly going to roll that out as their next step. That is, as I said earlier, going to suppress the demand for millimeter wave, which is the most test intensive portion of 5G. And so in the past calls, I have talked about LitePoint and Semi Test combined driving an incremental $400 million to $500 million worth of tester demand in the 5G era. And I think where we are in that now is we are probably in that $250 million to $300 million piece of it. And I think it is going to go sideways here for a while because of the fact that millimeter wave this year will be less probably investment than last year. And that will be the last kicker. Maybe it is still a couple of years out to bring it up to that full potential.\nShek Ho: Great. Maybe just lastly on the system level test, what is the size of that market today and how big could that be when those lower complexity devices that you alluded to starting to come into the market and maybe just a little bit on the competition side, how do you sustain your market share in that market?\nMark Jagiela: Yes. I think the market is pretty thin. We don't have a good number to give you on market size. But I think if you look at us in Advantest, you can kind of get a general sense. We probably, again, have 80% of the market between us. There are some other bespoke custom products that certain suppliers provide, but that is the way you could get at the market. And Advantest and Teradyne are kind of, I think, both hard-core players here. We each have our own benefits. And as we said earlier, this additional test step that high complexity devices are requiring is likely to proliferate into other markets. But two things are kind of important. I think some like the automotive market, as an example, is a very high-quality demanding market. But the volumes, frankly, are relatively low compared to something like a phone, 100 million cars versus 1.5 billion phones. So for a market like that with lower volume devices to take advantage of SLT, which they would love to. We need a different architecture that we are developing to address these, I would say, higher mix, lower volume markets. And I think our position and the sustainability of this is pretty good. It is like semiconductor tests, where the changeover costs are pretty high. Once you are in, somebody else has really got to have a better mousetrap by a long shot to sort of dislodge you.\nShek Ho: Thank you.\nAndrew Blanchard: Okay. We are out of time. Thanks so much for joining us today, and we look forward to talking to you in the days and weeks ahead. Thanks again. Bye-bye.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark Jagiela",
            "content": "Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. In my remarks, I will summarize our Q1 results, review current market conditions and provide an update on how we are looking at Q2 and the full-year. Sanjay will then take you through the financial details of the quarter and our outlook for the second quarter. As you saw in our press release, our Q1 sales and profits grew double digits from Q1 of 2020's record level. Test sales grew 9% on broad-based demand with notable strength in automotive, industrial compute, memory and storage. Industrial Automation sales grew 33% in the quarter with strong demand at both UR and MiR. Notably, since our January call, the market demand in both Test and IA has been greater than we expected, as you can see from our Q2 guidance. In Semiconductor Test, customer orders are very strong as complexity continues to increase and chip units are expected to grow almost 15% this year, more than twice last year's rate. Regarding the sustainability of this demand, our visibility is limited to just a quarter or two but the growth in WFE from 50 billion in 2017 to 60 billion last year to over 75 billion this year should translate into a healthy tester market in the years ahead. Looking at SOC demand, the auto industrial segment is especially robust, with our Q1 Eagle shipments up nearly 90% year-on-year, and deliveries expected to grow further in Q2. Test demand for mobility and compute devices is also running ahead of our January estimates as these end markets push the performance limits of advanced process nodes and drive the highest complexity growth. This higher complexity drives longer chip test times and often demand's unique tester capabilities. Our UltraFLEX platforms are well aligned to these performance dynamics. As a result of this demand strength, we now expect the SOC test market to be in the $4 billion to $4.4 billion range, up about $700 million at the midpoint from our January estimate. This equates to about 16% growth from 2020, and we expect our share in SOC to be at about the 50% level. In memory test, we are seeing continued strength in both flash and DRAM. We now expect the full-year memory test market to be in the $900 million to $1.1 billion range, up about $100 million from our January estimate and up about 5% from 2020 levels. Our Magnum platform is in lockstep with the performance trends in both markets, and we expect another strong year in 2021. However, since most of the test market growth is expected to be wafer test applications, where we have less exposure, we are likely to see our share dip a few points into the upper 30s. In System Test, revenue grew 14% from Q1 2020, primarily on higher Storage Test shipments. As we have noted in past calls, Storage Test is linked to increasing density and complexity of data center hard disk drives and the expanding adoption of system-level test per chip test. Our full-year outlook for this business has improved from January as well on strength in both applications. The defense and aerospace and Board test units of STG are also performing well, and we expect the overall group will grow revenue 5% to 10% this year. Our LitePoint business is driven by the complexity of new wireless standards and the connectivity cellular and other wireless markets. In Q1, connectivity demand was the dominant revenue driver as WiFi 6E ramps in smartphones and access points. We expect LitePoint to grow in the 0% to 5% range in 2021. Shifting to Industrial Automation, we are on-track to grow 30-plus percent for the year. At the macro level, industrial economies are recovering with global PMIs above 50, indicating growing manufacturing investments. At the ground level, we are seeing increasing customer buying driven by economics, quality and lack of available shop floor labor. At UR, revenue grew 32% from Q1 2020 with a notable recovery in China where sales more than doubled in the quarter. Our China performance reflects the compelling value proposition UR offers, even in the face of low-cost competitors. We not only have the durability to operate in high-intensity production environments where downtime can't be tolerated, but we also offer a unique suite of organic and ecosystem provided software and peripherals to address a wide range of tasks with short deployment times. We are also seeing growth outside of the traditional manufacturing tasks. In the last several quarters, we have seen volume shipments of cobots to perform industrial service tasks, such as maintenance of high-power transmission lines while energized and robotic inspection of wind turbine blades. Together, these two applications account for over 500 installed cobots, and this should approximately double in 2021. Both examples highlight the flexibility of UR arms and value in performing dangerous service tasks. MiR also delivered strong results in the quarter, growing 55% year-on-year. A big part of that success has been the new MiR 250, which was introduced in March of last year and was our leading seller in Q1. We are also seeing a nice expansion of applications for mere products. Initially, most applications were moving goods to and fro. Last year, we saw a dramatic expansion in the use of MiR robots as a platform for mobile tasks such as disinfected workspaces. And now we are seeing growing use in the conveyor market where our mobile platform replaces fixed conveyors. This provides owners greater flexibility than traditional fixed conveyor system and allows them to reconfigure their factory on the fly as production requirements dictate. Although both UR and MiR, our expanding range of plug-and-play apps, now totaling over 430 in our UR+ and MiRGo ecosystem shortens the deployment time and increases the addressable market for cobots, adding additional growth factors for us. But we are not firing on all cylinders in IA yet. At AutoGuide, we have lowered our expectations for 2021. The this year, we will focus on expanding existing customer deployments while we complete a series of engineering projects designed to scale and win new customers in the future. While this is surely a reset at our AutoGuide plan, we remain confident in the potential of the nascent market for high payload autonomous mobile robots and our ability to leverage AutoGuide's unique product architecture to deliver differentiated value to this growing market. Rolling it all up, the demand environment in our test businesses has strengthened dramatically since January and the wafer front end equipment forecasts suggest that tester demand over the next few years will continue to grow. In Industrial Automation, UR and MiR are benefiting from their differentiated products and the improving global economy, which puts us on-track for a total IA group revenue growth of 30-plus percent for the year. Our employees are doing a great job, and our operating model is delivering strong financial profits and free cash flow. And finally, I would like to recognize and thank our Board chair, Roy Valley, who will be retiring next month after 20-years on the Teradyne Board. Roy's leadership, integrity and wise counsel have been invaluable to me and the executive team, and we all wish him the best in his future pursuits. Sanjay will now take you through the financial details. Sanjay. Yes. I think it is a sub theme of what is happening in the compute area. The compute market for test this year will potentially double. Arm is eroding certain established share positions, and we are doing very well with arm. But I think we are still in early innings there. I don't think this is sort of the end; it is sort of the beginning. And the proliferation of other bespoke architectures that are high 10 billion plus transistor count devices is proliferating, at least in design. They haven't started to ramp yet, but they are being worked on in design. So it looks to me like over the next few years that compute segment just is going to be very strong. Yes. I think the system-level test and HDD markets are both still on a growth trajectory. We had a big, big year last year. We didn't expect that we might have a little digestion this year, but no, it is still heading north. And I think on the HDD front, that one looks like line of sight for several years ahead is positive. The Exabyte growth in the 18-terabyte and above drive space just is very test intensive. And I don't see anything sort of blunting the transitions in the cloud storage to anything, but those high-intensity drives. SLT is a little more of a, I think, a lumpy market at this point. It could continue to sequentially grow, but it is still limited to very I would say, a small subset of the market, manufacturers building very high complexity devices in high volumes. Now engineering work is going on to make SLT more meaningful to lower complexity devices. And I think as those products come to market over the next few years, you will start to see customer expansion in SLT and the market will grow. But I would sort of say, I wouldn't be surprised to see plus or minus 25% year-over-year swings as we try to get to a broader adoption of SLT. Yes. Unfortunately, I'm not going to be able to break down anything related to any customer's mix. So I can't address your question specifically. I do think though that the lumpiness compared to prior years has smoothed a bit because of the bigger portfolio of devices that are at play here. And one of the big revisions, I would say, to our market size estimate as we move through the year. I have always talked about and our largest customer, the demand profile becomes clear in April. And up until April, there is a lot of variability. And it is starting to become clear, and it is stronger than we had expected. So that is part of the story of what is driving up the market and our revenue this year. Yes. So there is a correlation and a lag, as you alluded to. So front end equipment usually goes into fabs, there is a period of time then after all of that is installed. Revenue gets recognized on behalf of those equipment makers and the fab gets tuned. The recipe, the yields and things before the fab has put into commission for real customer shipments. So that can take anywhere from - the good suppliers these days maybe get through that phase in about three to four months. But then it is not a light switch that turns on. It is more like a knob on a faucet because you start to ramp wafer outs slowly and you proportionately start adding testers. So what you can expect to see is, let's say, maybe the beginning of tester orders lag four to five months, but they really get going kind of a year after the fab equipment goes in. So if you offset the tester market from the fab investments by about, let's say, a year plus or minus three months, you get a good indication of growth. Now if you go back for the past five years, you will see there is been pretty steady monotonic growth in WFE and there is been pretty steady monotonic growth in the tester market. I think the most recent step, though, from 60 to 70 plus is larger than we have seen historically. So if all of that happens and it is truly put into commission, I would expect it to be something that pulls up the growth rate a little bit higher than we have seen in the past. But the one caution I would add is that what drives test again is transistor count, which we sometimes call complexity, but it is transistor count. And the capital intensity to build transistors at three nanometers and such on a per transistor basis is getting to be quite high. So it may turn out that it takes more CapEx per transistor at some of these nodes than it has historically. So that could mute a little bit the cause and effect. If you follow what I'm saying, but overall, the big, big picture is, you are right, it is correlated. Maybe it is a year plus or minus three month delay. Okay. Good question. Obviously, they are related, they are correlated. But for example, in 2020, we saw a dramatic increase in the tester market when cell phone units weren't growing. And that was all driven by complexity growth. So you can see the power of complexity growth alone by examining 2020, it is big. Now in 2021, interestingly, we are getting a year where the, I would say, complexity growth of the silicon going into phones is less than it was in 2020, but that is been more than offset by the fact that units are going to grow. So now we have units working for us a little more in a year where complexity, it is going up, but not as dramatically as it did last year. So it is almost a multiplicative effect of the two. And this year is really a story of both, but I would say without the unit growth, we would be looking at a smaller market, a smaller overall TAM than we are seeing. Yes. So memory test is strengthening. At the midpoint of the new market estimate, it will actually grow compared to last year, which again was a good year. It is the sort of areas that are growing, some of them were participating in and some of them were not. So China is growing dramatically, and we are doing very well in China. So we are seeing good pickup there of the products in both flash and DRAM, and we are gaining market share. In other geographies where DRAM is growing, the piece of the DRAM market, final test for LPDDR5 that we targeted our new product for and have a design wins. That is also looking very good and growing. But what is growing even faster is wafer test for DRAM, which is an area we really don't participate. It tends to be a low technology tester product that serves that market; it is not a big profit pool. And because of that, I alluded to the fact that our share might drop from 40%, 41% down to maybe 38%, 39% for the year. Yes. It doesn't change anything about our thinking on M&A and growth strategy in IA just to sort of take that one first. And over the course of many acquisitions we have done in the past 10-years, we have had various levels of success, I would say. The bigger acquisitions like the Nextest, the Eagles, the URs and the MiRs of the world have gone really, really well. And some of the smaller ones have taken longer to realize their potential than we expected at the beginning. And so AutoGuide is a case where we are kind of in that same situation. We started out last year, deploying the product into multiple big name, high potential accounts. And we are sort of lilly pad - lilly pad getting these initial deployments up and running. As we reflected back on where we stood, we were getting overextended on new accounts where the current accounts potential could be jeopardized by not doing more to augment the product with the ability to dock into other factory automation systems that these customers are implementing. So we have just decided, let's retrench around the five or six big accounts we have today, get them rock solid, develop these linkages to warehouse automation, manufacturing systems, strengthen our linkage to our MiR product line, so we have more of a seamless connection there. And just grow within those accounts and then go on to a more expensive footprint. So it is absolutely not what we planned a year ago when we acquired AutoGuide. But in the light of today, the opportunity looks so large that we think better off taking this task than just trying to proliferate more and more accounts. Yes. So I think there is a lot in what you just said. It is interesting and also possibly a deterrent to these regional fabs because a regional fab is, in my view, meaningless without the associated infrastructure around it, including test, supply of the chemistry, the local supply thing makes the whole venture economical. And as an alternative to doing everything in Taiwan, if you want to do in the U.S. or Japan or Europe, you really need a competitive infrastructure to get it done, so it will necessarily require test if it is not going to be an orphan. And I'm a little bit skeptical, will all of these jurisdictions have the 10-year sort of intestinal fortitude to move forward and invest in that kind of infrastructure build-out. But I think in the U.S. case, my read is that the answer is probably yes. The national security issues, there is just a lot behind this that suggests it is probably going to happen. And in the case of test and robots as well, I think the fracturing of the supply chain to be more geographically dispersed, on the one hand, maybe for a global economy is a little bad because it creates some inefficiency in the market, but for a supplier of equipment into that market. It is a helpful, it is a tailwind. And so I do think you are going to find probably globally a little bit less utilization efficiency of equipment because of this trend. But the national instincts around secure supply chains are going to overdrive that and probably subsidize it to some level. And I think both of our businesses will be a beneficiary of that. Yes. I will give you some rough numbers, but take it a little bit with a grain of salt because here we are three months later, talking about a big revision to our view of what the market size is. So I don't profess to be overly wise on this. But our current view on compute would be about $1 billion-ish market this year, for example. So not quite doubling, the year is not even halfway over. So who knows what could happen, but that is our current view. Mobility compared to last year is probably flattish, could be down a little bit compared to last year. The one part of mobility we haven't talked about that of all the places that are surging for demand, there is a pocket where demand is softer this year and that is in millimeter wave test capability. And last year, there was a lot of tooling for millimeter wave as some of the phones were early adopters of millimeter wave technology. But the fact of the matter is that telcos globally aren't deploying millimeter wave to any large extent spotty deployment in the U.S. and almost nothing outside of the U.S. And so that is suppressing demand this year for millimeter wave test equipment. That makes the - it is a little bit of a headwind for the mobility market. So call it flat to slightly down in mobility. At about, let's say, it is about 1.6 billion or 1.65 billion or so. The automotive and MCU market is closer to 450 for the year. That is up from about 225 last year, so big, big jump there. And the last segment that we sort of track is industrial, and that one is up to about 500 million from maybe 340, 325 last year. So that is how we segment it right now. Alright, a lot in there Tim, but I will try to take it on. So your point about the large customer or our large customer, never having sort of as a proportion of our revenue, three big years in a row. I think there is truth to that, but there is also a difference in what is happening, because the portfolio there is growing. If you go back to the sort of 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 area, it was kind of one device type that was driving the story and the demand. And now we are into a much broader portfolio, so I would just offer that that dynamics changed. And that is a fact that could propel this more sequential growth for a longer period of time. On the correlation between WFE test, SOC Test demand and whether that is stronger than who's buying, let's say, certainly, customers have different test intensities. And so part of the noise that is running under the hood, certainly as it relates to our revenue is related to large high test intensity customers and how much they are buying. We are fortunate that we participate in segments of the market that tend to have high test intensities, but that is by design. We target those segments. And it is not just one large customer that produces devices that have high test intensity. There are others, and that is where we play. So I would agree with you that if the market shifted away from high test intensity customers meeting high complexity devices, you could see a disconnect an anchor on the test market that was disconnected from WFE. But it just doesn't seem likely because the reason these investments are being made in the front end. And the reason they are so expensive to make is that they are going after three nanometer EUV lines to build devices for these very customers we are talking about. So I just don't see that the disconnect can emerge unless the fab sit idle. If the fabs are going to say, idle, yes. But if the fabs aren't going to be idle, it is the exact customers we are talking about that are going to utilize them. So I don't disabuse your point. It actually has some merit, but I just think the correlation, almost by definition, has to occur unless the fabs are idle. Yes. So most of the growth is, I would say, coming - what is it non custom silicon, I couldn't say that. I think growth is coming from the nontraditional suppliers of compute devices is a disproportionate amount of it. But the other usual suspects are growing too. AMD, obviously, is growing and NVIDIA is obviously growing. So it is broad-based. But as a proportion, I would say, yes, you are right. It is probably some of the newer players that are growing the market faster than others. And as to our share position, historically, our share in compute has been below our overall market share. So maybe in the 30s and moves around in the 30s is where it is been. We are trending into a period of time because of this change of who is building these devices where our share is more likely to move up closer to our overall average share in the market. So if our SOC average share is somewhere in the 50-ish range, it might take a little bit of time, but that is kind of where we are trending to. Yes. I think the big issue is wafers, not in terms of bottlenecking, the automotive manufacturers. That doesn't mean that we are completely aligned on deliveries for test equipment to the chip suppliers who are trying to ramp shipments. We are misaligned by a few weeks here and there. And we are pulling like mad and they are pulling like mad. But the big, big, bigger issue is getting wafer capacity. So we are not in the headlights quite yet, but we are certainly in intense conversations to try to pick up a week or two here or there so that they can get a little bit more out a week or so sooner. Automotive always kind of goes in fits and starts. And I think the supply chain in automotive is going to come out of this, having learned a lesson that they can't be so lean on just in time. And I know that raises the specter of everybody's worry that there is inventory being going to be built in addition to real line demand. And I think that will happen. That is certainly not happening yet, that is to come. So there is going to be a phase here where we get through the urgency, then there will be investments made to build more, I would say, slack in the system for the devices that go into automotive. So that will be a bit of a balloon. But then it will settle back to, I think it is normal rhythm. Where increasing electronic and chip attach rates in automobiles will drive the market. And we are going to get to kind of a peak level of test investment in automotive this year, close to that $500 million number. And that could even - certainly, I think it could sustain through the end of the year because of this inventory catch up. But my guess is as we get into the 2022 area and beyond, it will sort of back into oscillating between the 300 million to 500 million range. Yes. That is a little tricky. So first of all, let me say that most of the applications processors in your phone, which is a 1.5 billion unit market, are Arm-based processors. And those devices in the high-end phones, which comprise maybe 400 million to 500 million units out of the 1.5, have transistor counts on par with any desktop or laptop computer you might buy, 10 billion-plus kind of transistors. So when you look at the test intensity there compared to a traditional microprocessor, it is a little bit more efficient, I would say than the traditional microprocessor, but not a lot, more efficient. So for the same, let's say, 10 billion transistor x86 architecture compared to a map device in your phone, maybe it is at 90% versus 100% kind of test time delta, so not big. Now when you get into Arm-based compute devices for more non-phone applications. There is different cash requirements, different IO technologies needed that further complexify the Arm implementation that bring it back up to test intensity is very similar to the x86 world. So I don't see a big difference there. So it is certainly in our M&A funnel, there is various opportunities like that. But what I would say is that many of the startups in the IA and machine learning space that are exploring ways to enhance robots, cobots, are doing it on our platform as a partner. If you go into our again, UR+ ecosystem or a MiRGo ecosystem, you will see a variety of machine learning and AI tools. That have been targeted and customized for our products. So we are benefiting from them whether we own them or not. We do have organic IA products that we have on our MiR platform already. But it is going to be important for the evolution of ease of use and applications expansion for cobots, for sure. And whether we need to own it, or whether we need to be the preferred platform that they all write their apps for, I think, is still kind of a case-by-case consideration for us. Yes. I think infrastructure is really not driving much tester demand generally. It did for us back in 2019 when China was going crazy, rolling out sub-6G and Huawei was investing heavily at the time. But the kind of what is now a $5 billion tester market, infrastructure, 5G investments are, I think, always going to be sub-100 million and maybe more in the sort of $60 million to $70 million range. The bigger one is what happens with the phones and the terminals and such. And there, the U.S., the spectrum auction around sub-6G is concluded. I think that carriers are kind of clearly going to roll that out as their next step. That is, as I said earlier, going to suppress the demand for millimeter wave, which is the most test intensive portion of 5G. And so in the past calls, I have talked about LitePoint and Semi Test combined driving an incremental $400 million to $500 million worth of tester demand in the 5G era. And I think where we are in that now is we are probably in that $250 million to $300 million piece of it. And I think it is going to go sideways here for a while because of the fact that millimeter wave this year will be less probably investment than last year. And that will be the last kicker. Maybe it is still a couple of years out to bring it up to that full potential. Yes. I think the market is pretty thin. We don't have a good number to give you on market size. But I think if you look at us in Advantest, you can kind of get a general sense. We probably, again, have 80% of the market between us. There are some other bespoke custom products that certain suppliers provide, but that is the way you could get at the market. And Advantest and Teradyne are kind of, I think, both hard-core players here. We each have our own benefits. And as we said earlier, this additional test step that high complexity devices are requiring is likely to proliferate into other markets. But two things are kind of important. I think some like the automotive market, as an example, is a very high-quality demanding market. But the volumes, frankly, are relatively low compared to something like a phone, 100 million cars versus 1.5 billion phones. So for a market like that with lower volume devices to take advantage of SLT, which they would love to. We need a different architecture that we are developing to address these, I would say, higher mix, lower volume markets. And I think our position and the sustainability of this is pretty good. It is like semiconductor tests, where the changeover costs are pretty high. Once you are in, somebody else has really got to have a better mousetrap by a long shot to sort of dislodge you."

            "name": "Sanjay Mehta",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Today, I will provide details on our Q1 results, offer additional color on the operating environment, along with our plans to address a very strong demand environment and describe our Q2 outlook. During the appropriate sections, I will provide some full-year expectations. Now to Q1. First quarter sales were $782 million with non-GAAP EPS of $1.11. Non-GAAP gross margins were 59.1% and our non-GAAP operating expenses were $230 million, above our high guidance due to high variable compensation and G&A expenses. Non-GAAP operating profit rate was 29.6%. We had two 10% customers in the quarter. Tax rate, excluding discrete items for the quarter, was 14.75% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Looking at the results from a business unit perspective, semi test revenue was $528 million, was up 9% from Q1 2021. SOC revenue was $420 million, up from prior year, driven by strength in compute, industrial and automotive markets, offset by a decline and our mobility shipments. Memory revenue was $108 million, up from prior year, driven by strength in flash final test segment. System Test Group had revenue of $133 million which was up 14% year-over-year. This was driven by $95 million in storage test sales, including HDD and SLT solutions and $38 million in defense and aerospace and production board test. At LitePoint, revenue of $41 million was above plan, but down about 6% from prior year due to lower cellular test shipments. Looking at our test portfolio overall. We are very optimistic about the market and technology trends unfolding over the midterm. The growing attach rate of electronics across the economy, the increasing complexity of those devices and significantly, a faster refresh rate for many of these complex devices benefit all of our test businesses. Looking at a significant example, the increasing number of companies creating high-performance processors to serve a growing range of end applications, each with unique performance and design cycles, is driving an estimated doubling of the compute portion of the SOC test market this year compared with 2018. We have designed our UltraFLEXplus platform to serve this growing market and are having early success. This trend has complementary impacts on memory and SLT markets as well. Now to Industrial Automation. Given 2020 was a contraction year; I will provide revenue metrics comparing Q1 2021 results with Q1 2020 and Q1 2019. Industrial Automation revenue was $80 million, was up 33% year-over-year and 21% over Q1 2019. Q1 2021 was a record for the seasonally soft first quarter of the year. U.S. and Europe represented over 70% of our IA revenue in the first quarter. As Mark noted, strength in China for UR, I will add that we saw the IA group revenue in China more than double year-over-year and grow greater than 50% over Q1 2019. UR sales were $66 million in Q1, up 32% year-over-year and 15% over Q1 2019. MiR sales were $14 million, up 55% from both Q1 2020 and Q1 2019. Sales increased in every region over Q1 2020. In addition to the success of MiR 250 that Mark noted, we also are starting to see a positive shipment trend towards higher payload MiR 500 and MiR 1,000 models, which should improve our ASPs overtime. Demand at both UR and MiR continues to improve as the global economy recovers and companies work to add production capacity. The opportunity of automation is growing. Our IA portfolio is solving problems for companies such as improving economics with a typical ROI of approximately one year, addressing labor shortages experienced by manufacturing and warehousing firms and adding supply chain resilience over the long-term. From a financial perspective in IA, we continue to lean into engineering, ecosystem and distribution investments to expand the range of applications in IA products - our IA products address and extend our global distribution reach. Our goal in the short-term is to balance investments with sales growth in order to deliver an annual IA group operating profit of between 5% and 15%. However, given the reset mark described at AutoGuide, we now expect Ag revenues of less than $10 million in 2021, and Ag will not be profitable in 2021. As a result, at the IA group level, we expect we will operate above breakeven in 2021, but below that target profit range. We do expect both UR and MiR each operate above the rule of 40 in 2021. That is the sum of the operating profit; revenue growth will be over $40 million. We continue to have confidence in our IA growth over the midterm, as articulated in our January earnings model update and expect the overall group to grow revenue over 30% in 2021. Shifting to supply. As Mark noted, the test market size has increased significantly across the board. From a supply perspective, we are dealing with increasing lead times and cost increases, predominantly in the semiconductor area. Given the significant demand increase in the challenging supply environment, we are experiencing some shipment delays. This is most acute in the automotive and industrial tester markets where demand is significantly outstripping supply. We are working with our customers on a daily basis to minimize the impact of these delays. We see this challenge accelerating into the third quarter with supplier lead times increasing. I appreciate the incredible pace of our operations team and partners around the world have operated for over a year and continue to be impressed with their efforts to meet the needs of our customers. To sustain that pace and create a more resilient operation, we are continuing to invest in manufacturing capacity around the world. This includes qualifying redundant suppliers, production sites for critical components and redundant manufacturing capacity in new locations. Shifting to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our cash and marketable securities at the end of the quarter totaled $1.43 billion. We had $1 million in negative free cash flow in the quarter and spent $45 million and $17 million on buybacks and dividends, respectively. To-date, $67 million of the RTI convertible bondholders have elected to convert early. And in Q1, we paid $51 million of it to the bondholders. Regarding the buyback, we plan to increase our daily buying throughout the year and expect to purchase a minimum of 600 million in 2021, as noted in January. The relatively low volume of buybacks in Q1 was planned for three reasons. First, recall Q1 is a seasonally high use of cash, where we typically pay out our variable compensation and ramp up our prepayments to support increased Q2 test production. Second, we wanted to understand how much of our convertible debt would be redeemed in Q1. Third, we wanted to confirm the global recovery from the pandemic remained on-track. Now to Q2. As you have heard this morning, customer demand is strong and in nearly all parts of the business, our guidance assumes that we will continue to be successful dealing with the numerous material shortages we noted earlier and that we won't see additional pandemic related issues. With that said sales in Q2 are expected to be between $1.01 billion and $1.09 billion, with non-GAAP EPS in a range of $1.62 and to $1.83 on 177 million diluted shares. The second quarter guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles and the non-cash imputed interest on the convertible debt. Second quarter gross margins are estimated at 58%. OpEx is expected to run at 23% to 25% of second quarter sales. The non-GAAP operating profit at the midpoint of our second quarter guidance is 34%. Regarding OpEx for the full-year. We now expect OpEx will grow 17% to 19% over 2020. Note that this is up from our January plan for 2021, where we guided growth over 2020 at 8% to 10%. The increase from January in order of magnitude is in three general categories. One, higher revenue-driving higher estimated variable compensation and higher engineering costs related to mitigating supply constraints. Two, higher incremental spending to accelerate several engineering projects in test and IA. And three, higher-than-expected G&A spending related to legal, insurance and IT costs. As we noted in January and included in the estimate, we expect travel and marketing expenses to increase through the remainder of the year as pandemic restrictions ease. As outlined last quarter, we set our sight on reaching $5.25 to $6.75 in EPS by 2024 in our earnings model. In 2021, we expect our largest end market, semi test, to grow 14% and at the estimated midpoint above the estimate in our earnings model. Combined with industrial end markets recovering from the pandemic slump, these data points reinforce that our midterm earnings plan is on a solid foundation. We update our earnings model each January. In our next update, we will look closely at both the WFE forecast and test growth rates. To sum up, the demand environment across nearly all of our markets remain strong, and we are working closely with our suppliers and customers to expand shipments and minimize the impact of material shortages. We have had an outstanding start to the year, and we are on a path to healthy sales growth and profit growth for 2021. At the midpoint of our Q2 guidance, we will see sales grow 19% and non-GAAP EPS grow 21% above the first half of 2020, which itself was a record. We are well on our way to achieving our midterm revenue and earnings goals we set in our new earnings model. With that, I will turn things back to Andy. Sure. Thanks. Yes. So as you know, M&A is to keep of our allocation strategy. And over the years, we have had a focus on industrial automation. We have an active business development organization that continues to look at different opportunities. And we will continue to do so. And we are spending time as a management team kind of reviewing them. And when an opportunity makes sense both financially and a strategic product fit, we will act and we will advise at that time. Sure. So first on the cost of sales, yes, we have seen certain cost increase. Raw materials, semiconductor components, et cetera. And fundamentally, we have been able to manage through those. And we expect, from a full-year perspective, we will be at model from a gross margin, 58% to 59%. And so we are just kind of managing through those cost increases. And from an operating expense perspective, yes, we are seeing a lower operating leverage in Q1, really some OpEx increases, but really throughout the year, you should expect to see us improve our operating leverage throughout the year. Yes. Mehdi, it is Sanjay here. It is roughly a 50/50 split, plus or minus a bit. And as Mark indicated, from an HDD perspective, really strong end market growth and SLT, there is some investments going to expand that market. But we see growth in both. Yes, great question. So we are seeing shortages, and we have been able to - through our inventory strategies as well as multiple suppliers been able to work through them. Fundamentally, in the rise of the demand in 2020 and through COVID and then in [2020] (Ph) in Q1. We are seeing it in Q2, and we see it getting supply getting tighter. We are seeing lead times increase from our suppliers across the board. And we are booked out pretty much for the year. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we are spending more engineering dollars and qualifying different suppliers. So it is getting tighter as demand continues to increase throughout the year. And Q2, we feel pretty good about where we are at in the range. Of course, there is always things we are managing. But Q3, we see it getting tighter. Visibility, we have good visibility into Q3, some issues we are working through. And then Q4, the visibility, obviously, further out, it goes down. I would say on the duplicate orders perspective, I don't really see in the demand statement, a whole set of duplication of orders. We are working with our customers, we are understanding their specific needs and working to get them what they need and just working through that. It is Sanjay. So I made the comment that we were booked at, and it was really tied to our supply perspective. We are working with both contract manufacturers and our direct suppliers to fundamentally make sure that we have orders on the books until the end of the year, just given the supply constraints environment. Yes. When you take a look at the numbers, overall, maybe I will comment overall. We are expecting to see, given the visibility and obviously, with a significant reset of the market size, and as we move throughout the year, the lack of visibility in the second half. But with all of those provisions, we are seeing overall an expectation that the second half of the year revenue will be slightly down, both for the enterprise. And that is a similar direction down for Semi Test. Yes, hi it is Sanjay. Yes. So from a U.S. perspective, we are seeing the snapback, whether you look at increases over Q1 of 2019, pre-COVID year or even Q1 of 2020, similar with Europe, a very strong kind of double-digit snapback over either year."

I would now like to turn the call over to Andy Blanchard, Vice President of Corporate Communications. Thank you. You may begin. \nAndrew Blanchard : Thank you, Daryl. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our discussion of Teradyne's most recent financial results. I'm joined this morning by our CEO, Mark Jagiela; President, Greg Smith; and our CFO, Sanjay Mehta.  Following our opening remarks, we'll provide details of our performance for 2022's fourth quarter and full year, along with our outlook for the first quarter of 2023. The press release containing our fourth quarter results was issued last evening. We're providing slides on the Investor page of the website that may be helpful to you in following the discussion. Replays of this call will be available via the same page after the call ends.  The matters that we discuss today will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause Teradyne's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the safe harbor language contained in the earnings release as well as our most recent SEC filings. Additionally, those forward-looking statements are made as of today, and we take no obligation to update them as a result of events occurring after this call. During today's call, we'll make reference to non-GAAP financial measures. We've posted additional information concerning these non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial as it were available on the Investor page of our website.  Looking ahead between now and our next earnings call, Teradyne expects to participate in technology or industrial-focused investor conferences hosted by Citi, Susquehanna, Luke Capital and Morgan Stanley.  Now let's get on with the rest of the agenda. First, Mark and Greg will comment on our recent results and the market conditions as we enter the new year. Sanjay will then offer more details on our quarterly results, along with our guidance for the first quarter. We'll then answer your questions, and this call is scheduled for 1 hour.  Mark? \nMark Jagiela: Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us this morning. I'm going to limit my remarks today as Greg will be taking full leadership of the company from next week. I'll leave the outlook to Greg, and Sanjay will provide the financial details, including our updated midterm earnings model.  2022 was another good year for Teradyne with our second highest sales in history. Midyear, we saw a turn in our markets with the SOC test market softening after 6 years of growth and Industrial Automation growth slowing.  At the company level, our financial results were slightly under the long-term trend line after operating well above trend in 2020 and 2021. This oscillation around the trend line is a familiar pattern that we expect to continue. We manage our business investments according to this trend line and tend not to chase these excursions up or down. Sanjay will note how these trend lines roll into our updated midterm earnings model.  Looking at a longer-term perspective, over the last 8 years, Teradyne's revenue has about doubled and EPS has grown about 4x. Growth of our core test markets is part of the story, as is expansion into new markets like Industrial Automation and System Level Test. This, combined with a rich cash flow and a balanced capital allocation plan, has been the recipe for shareholder returns. As you will hear, we see all of these drivers remaining in place for the years to come.  Since this is my last earnings call, I would like to thank all of you who follow, invest and influence our journey at Teradyne. As Greg takes on the role, I'm confident we won't miss a beat, and he's been a key part of developing and implementing our strategy for many years.  With that, I'll turn things over to Greg for his deeper perspective on our results and outlook. Greg? \nGreg Smith: Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will summarize the full year of 2022 and then comment on our early view of 2023. For the full year, we delivered sales of $3.155 billion and non-GAAP earnings of $4.25 per share.  2022 was the second-highest revenue in company history but down 15% from 2021's record level due mainly to reduced demand in SOC test, specifically in mobility and compute. This offset was -- this was offset somewhat by strength in the automotive end market, including substantial demand for ADAS processor test. Overall for 2022, we estimate the SOC test market was about $4.6 billion, down 6% from '21, and the memory market was down a similar amount for the year. Industrial Automation grew about 7% in dollar terms. Foreign exchange was a major headwind in that business. Our growth was 15% in constant currency.  I'll divide my comments on market conditions into an early view of 2023, followed by our outlook for the midterm. In July of last year, we noted the Semi Test equipment market was entering a downturn, with demand declining in end markets such as smartphones. This began to create chip supply/demand and inventory imbalances.  We noted these types of corrections typically have a 4- to 6-quarter duration. Now we're a bit more than 2 quarters in, and as the downturn continues, our customers continue to rebalance their production and inventory with end market demand. Much of the imbalance is in test-intensive end markets like smartphones, compute and networking, where we see lower utilization. At this point in time, with limited visibility into the second half, we estimate a market size for SOC tests to be 10% to 30% below 2022's $4.6 billion level. Major SOC producers are expected to start the transition to 3-nanometer later in 2023, and this could mitigate the headwinds a bit.  Our historically largest end customer is expected to lead this transition, and revenue driven by this customer is expected to grow in 2023, moving from less than 10% of our revenue in 2022 to low double-digit percents of revenue for this year. Demand won't be finalized until Q2 and will be weighted towards the second half of the year.  In general, our models factor in 2 key demand drivers, unit volume and device complexity. We've read the same press reports that you have, that smartphone volumes are likely to be down in 2023. The complexity growth associated with the 3-nanometer transition is likely to offset the test demand impact of the unit decrease, and the net effect is the increase in revenue that I've described. Our assumption that this transition is going to be gradual is likely to mute the peaks, but it will also fill in the troughs as the full portfolio migrates to 3-nanometer.  Overall, averaging across the entire life of a process node, like 5-nanometer or 3-nanometer, we expect that each new node will drive continued higher test investment in total than the prior node. On top of that, increased unit growth and the addition of new part types to the portfolio will drive further increases in test investment.  In the memory test market, technology transitions continue to drive demand. Faster interface speeds in DRAM with DDR5 and in flash with UFS 4.0 cannot be tested on existing testers and are driving purchases of next-generation ATE. Offsetting this technology-driven replacement demand is a difficult end market for our memory customers, which is likely to reduce capacity buying for this year. We are seeing some impact of that in the first quarter.  On balance, we expect the memory test market size to be flat to slightly down from 2022. We expect Storage Test will be weak in 2023 due to excess capacity in the HDD end market. And Wireless Test demand will be soft on lower smartphone shipments and a demand lull in advance of the transition to WiFi 7 beginning in 2024. Shifting to Industrial Automation. As we expected, the macro-outlook in industrial markets is cautious, with weak industrial PMIs. We expect this will be a growth headwind in the first half of the year. Rolling up these headwinds and offsetting factors over the first half of the year, our current judgment for the total company has our second quarter about flat with Q1. However, in Industrial Automation for the full year, we have 3 notable factors that should help offset these headwinds later in the year.  First, we do not expect the currency exchange impacts we experienced in 2022. Second, growth initiatives that began in 2022, including a channel transformation at UR, will gain traction. One component of the channel transformation is supplementing our traditional distributor channel with a focused OEM channel. That effort delivered 26% growth in 2022, and we expect this to continue in 2023 as our existing OEM partners continue to grow and we add additional OEMs and targeted verticals.  The third factor driving IA growth is expanding the served market through new products. Most notably, in 2023, shipments of the new long-reach, heavy-payload cobot at Universal Robots, the UR20, which will ramp in the second half of the year. Barring a significant deterioration in the macro economy and reasonably stable currencies, we expect channel expansion, combined with new products, to drive greater than 20% growth for IA in 2023, weighted to the second half of the year.  Now shifting to the midterm outlook. The short-term changes in customer buying patterns in semi cap equipment can be abrupt. We built our flexible operating model to accommodate those cycles. Our midterm plans track the long-term historical trends and the future demand drivers in each of our businesses rather than the short-term cycles. In any given year, we will land above or below trend, but that trend line has provided a reliable baseline for planning.  Sanjay will be going through a quantitative view of our 2026 earnings model. To set up that discussion, I'd like to make a few qualitative comments to provide some context. Our 2026 earnings model shows significant revenue and EPS growth, and it's reasonable to ask why we assume midterm growth when the short-term environment is so weak. There are several factors that give us confidence in our midterm outlook. End markets, like AI and cloud computing, mobile processing and automotive, including ADAS and EV, are driving increased semiconductor content and increasing chip complexity.  The deployment of advanced wireless standards will support ever higher data volumes and the pervasive deployment of edge AI. This end market demand will drive the timeline for new semi fab nodes and packaging technologies, like 3-nanometer, chiplets and gate all around.  We have seen these technology transitions drive demand for test as the new nodes enable more complex chips and multichip packaging technologies like chiplets drive higher quality level requirements. Both of these factors drive longer test times and higher ATE TAMs. But the landscape is changing. These complex chips are increasingly developed by a new class of vertically integrated producers, or VIPs, including hyperscalers and automakers.  We've had good design-in success to date with this emerging customer type, and these VIPs provide Teradyne with an opportunity to grow share in a space long dominated by legacy x86 architectures, where our share has historically been lower. These large, complex devices are used in uptime-critical applications and will require exceptionally low defect levels. To achieve this quality level, our customers will increasingly adopt an additional test step, system-level tests or SLT. We have a strong footprint in this growing market, and our design-in success with new customers is expected to be a growth driver over the midterm. Over the midterm, we expect to see WiFi 7 ramp and the rapid expansion of UWB-enabled devices for both precision location tracking and security. These new standards obsolete existing test instrumentation, and this replacement cycle will be a growth engine over the midterm for both SOC test and Wireless Test.  Turning to IA. Global labor shortages and converging regional wages will continue to be unrelenting demand drivers. Market penetration for collaborative robots, including AMRs, is under 5%, providing enormous opportunities for long-term growth.  The steady application of new technologies in our products will continue to expand our served market, and the transformation of our channel will enable us to serve a broader range of customers and drive revenue to the $1 billion level in 2026. Summing it up. Over the midterm, our strong core test businesses will support share gain and trend line growth, while IA will grow to be about 20% of company sales and become a meaningful contributor to earnings.  In 2022, we have planted the seeds for future growth. We expanded our design-in footprint in the vertically integrated producer space and recognized substantial revenues from this emerging market. We expanded our customer base in SLT. We grew our IA sales in challenging business conditions and set the foundation for higher long-term growth at both Universal Robots and [Newark].  We're in a cyclical downturn in the semiconductor capital industry, and visibility in downturns is always a challenge. We expect sales and earnings to be below our midterm trend line in 2023. While we don't have line of sight to an inflection in demand, that's typical in these cycles. The market will recover, and we expect to return to historical growth rates driving strong earnings over our midterm planning horizon, as Sanjay will describe.  Before turning it over to Sanjay, I would like to thank Mark for his more than 40 years of service to Teradyne and his 9 years as CEO. He has steered the company through an extraordinary period in the semiconductor industry and helped to assure our future growth through our investments in robotics.  More personally, it's been an honor to work for Mark during that period. His candor and insight has made me and all of us at Teradyne better. Although we're facing a cyclical downturn, we're facing it as a company with tremendous financial strength, a great team and a clear strategic vision, thanks to Mark.  Now Sanjay? \nSanjay Mehta: Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover the financial summary of Q4 and the full year 2022, provide our Q1 outlook and review our updated earnings model and capital allocation plans. Now to Q4. Fourth quarter sales were $732 million, which was approximately $20 million above our mid guide with non-GAAP EPS of $0.92. Semi Test revenue of $481 million was strong in Automotive and Industrial and SOC.  System Test group had revenue of $100 million, down 22% year-over-year, driven by lower sales in Storage Tests serving a weaker HDD end market, slightly offset by higher defense and aerospace and Production Board Tests. LitePoint revenue of $40 million was down 23% from a year ago due to lower cellular and WiFi demand. Industrial Automation revenue of $110 million was down 2% from fourth quarter of last year, but up 7% in constant currency. Non-GAAP gross margins were 57.4%, above our guidance, due to favorable product mix and some resiliency costs deferred until the first half of '23. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $252 million, about flat with third quarter OpEx. Non-GAAP operating profit rate was 23%. We had one customer -- we had one 10% customer in the quarter. The tax rate, excluding discrete items for the quarter, was 12.3% on a non-GAAP basis and lower than planned because of geographic mix. We repurchased $2 million of shares in the quarter.  Turning to the full-year results. We had revenue of approximately $3.2 billion. QUALCOMM was our one 10% customer for the full year. Gross margin for the year was 59.2%, OpEx was $1 billion, and operating profit was 27.5%. Non-GAAP EPS was $4.25. We generated $415 million in free cash flow in 2022. We returned $822 million to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends and ended the year with $1 billion of cash and marketable securities. Our tax rate for the full year, excluding discrete items, was 16.3% on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.  Semi Test revenue for the year was $2.1 billion, with SOC revenue contributing $1.7 billion and memory $373 million. Our SOC sales contracted in 2022. But I'll note a bright spot for us in Automotive, where year-on-year shipments increased over 60%. In memory, our sales declined about 6% and were roughly evenly split between flash and DRAM. System Test group had revenue of $469 million, which was flat to 2021. Strength in defense and aerospace and Production Board Test was offset by a decline in our storage business. In Wireless Test, revenue of $202 million in 2022 was lower year-on-year, with declines in cellular and connectivity partially offset by strength in UWB.  Now to Industrial Automation. IA revenue was $404 million, with UR contributing $326 million and MiR $77 million, which includes. Notably, MiR grew 26% for the year in constant currency, 19% in dollars. Large portion of IA sales are outside the U.S. and sold in local currencies. For the full year, 40% of the IA sales were in Europe, 35% in the U.S., 11% in China and the remainder in the rest of the world. From a profitability perspective in IA, the group was slightly above breakeven on a non-GAAP operating basis for the full year.  Now to our outlook for Q1. In October, we expected Q1 revenue of approximately $640 million which was projected to be down 10% from our Q4 midpoint. Since then, 3 declines have occurred: First, approximately $20 million of revenue was pulled in from Q1. Second, we expect approximately $20 million of supply constraints in Q1, which has not been included in our guidance range. Third, approximately $20 million of memory related to capacity additions has shifted to later in the year, including other offsetting factors.  Q1 sales are expected to be between $550 million and $630 million, with non-GAAP EPS in a range of $0.28 to $0.52 on 165 million diluted shares. First quarter guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles. First quarter gross margins are estimated at 55% to 56%, down from Q4 due to lower volume and higher spending on accelerating our manufacturing and service resiliency. OpEx is expected to run at 39% to 44% of first quarter sales. The non-GAAP operating profit rate at the midpoint of our first quarter guidance is 14%.  A few points to assist you in the modeling in 2023. First, the gross margin profile. In 2023, we expect gross margins will be below our model in the first half, driven by lower volume and additional spending on accelerating our manufacturing and service resiliency. We expect second half gross margins to return to our 59% to 60% model range. Regarding OpEx for the full year. We expect full year 2023 OpEx to be roughly flat, compared with 2022. IA profitability is planned to be in the range of 5% to 15% profit level on higher volume. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate is forecasted to be 16.75% in 2023.  Turning to capital allocation. Our strategy remains consistent as we take a balanced approach and prioritize free cash flow to maintain a minimum cash level to run the business and to have reserves set aside in the event of a significant downturn. Excess free cash flow will be prioritized for M&A, share buybacks and dividends. Prior share buyback authorization was replaced with a new $2 billion authorization. We expect up to $500 million of repurchases in 2023.  Moving to our earnings model. We expect test and IA growth will drive 2026 company revenue to approximately $5 billion and non-GAAP EPS to $8.75 at the midpoint of the updated model. Gross margin is estimated at 59% to 60%. OpEx as a percent of sales will decline to 26% to 28%, yielding a non-GAAP operating margin of 31% to 34%.  Some context on the model. Over the last 6 years, Teradyne has grown revenue at a compounded 10% rate and our non-GAAP EPS at a 19% rate. Our model midpoint, we -- at our model midpoint, we expect the 2016 to 2026 extended trend line for revenue and non-GAAP EPS CAGRs will be -- to be 11% and 19%, respectively, roughly in line with the historical rate and reflecting an increasing contribution of revenue from Industrial Automation. We have included a backup slide in the deck that illustrates these trends.  In prior calls and Greg's comments today, we have outlined the key drivers for the test portfolio, including device technology trends, complexity and unit growth, which we anticipate will drive ATE growth over the 4-year horizon. Our test revenues are expected to grow at a CAGR of 8% to 13% from 2022 to 2026. For IA, we believe this market is still sub-5% penetrated. Greg has outlined the drivers over the midterm for this market, including labor shortages, new products and applications and channel transformation. Our IA revenues are expected to grow 20% to 30% from 2022 to 2026.  Summing up. After 6 years of growth, the SOC test market slowed in the second half of 2022, and our financial model flexed down as designed. Despite the smaller test market, we delivered 27.5% non-GAAP operating profit, generated over $400 million in free cash flow, returned over $800 million to shareholders, reduced our share count by 4% and ended the year with $1 billion in cash.  Going forward, our updated model builds on proven foundation of historical growth in test and IA and includes new drivers of future growth. While there is uncertainty in the short run, we are confident of the growth opportunities in the markets we serve and our team executing our strategy to capture that growth.  With that, I'll turn the call back over to Andy. Andy? \nAndrew Blanchard : Thanks, Sanjay. Daryl, we would now like to take some questions. [Operator Instructions].\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first questions come from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.\nMehdi Hosseini : The first one has to do with the Semi Test cycle. You did mention in your prepared remarks that perhaps we are in the second quarter of a typical downturn that would last 4 to 6 quarters. But wouldn't that be fair to say that the situation with Teradyne Semi Test is different? If I just look at your guide for Q1, it would suggest that Semi Test is already down by more than 50% since the peak some time in early '21, and perhaps Teradyne is well into the semi cycle correction. I would appreciate if you could help me reconcile, and then I have a follow-up. \nGreg Smith: Thanks for the question, Mehdi. Our thought in terms of the Semi Test cycle is that we really don't have great visibility. Where -- we believe we are about 2 quarters in. And one thing to remember is that the peak that you're talking about was well above our trend line. So there was a fair amount of contraction to happen before we got into a region, where we would have considered it to be sort of a true downturn. So we're really measuring from that sort of July of '22 time frame. And we think we are just about 2 quarters into it.  In terms of when it will inflect back up, we really don't have good visibility. There are a number of factors that make us feel a little bit better about the second half of the year than the first. But we don't see the kinds of leading indicators that the demand is returning. So I don't think we can give you a lot more color than that. \nQ - Mehdi Hosseini : Got it. As my second as a follow-up and as a follow-up to your comment, would it be fair to say that you have pushed out your targeted model by 2 years because you just -- we don't know the rate of recovery into '24, and yet you have a new target 2026. We may go through another downturn before we get to that target. But the main valuable here is the rate of recovery into '24, and we just don't know. And I also want to thank Mark for all the calls that he has hosted and wish him the best of luck in his next endeavor. \nSanjay Mehta: Yes. Mehdi, it's Sanjay. Yes, I think it's a reasonable comment to say that the model has shifted to the right, really tied to the economic downturn. Really, as Greg mentioned, the inventory in the channel tied to the demand in the end markets coming down and the supply in the market. \nMark Jagiela: And maybe, Mehdi, thank you for those kind comments. I'll just make one quick comment on your first point, which is every downturn cycle, as we try to measure, it's different. But if you classify it around when does the imbalance between semiconductor supply and demand start to inflect and cause an industry-wide downturn, from that point of view, we see it as something that started last summer. So that's how -- why we mark it back to that date. \nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS.\nTimothy Arcuri : So the SOC TAM in 2022, it came in at the high end of what your range was. So what segment drove that in 2022? And then, can you also segment for us, in 2023, how you see the mix? I mean, I think this year, you'd been -- you sort of gave us some numbers for each of the markets. Can you sort of tell us -- if you just take the midpoint of that down 20%, can you tell us sort of what the mix will be, and how the different markets will change? \nSanjay Mehta: Yes. It's Sanjay. Yes, 2022, the SOC market, we estimate about $4.6 billion and continued strength in compute, a little bit down in '22 from '21 in mobility, and then strength in auto that we referenced in prior calls, and industrial continued along with service. And in '23, really across the board in SOC, we see a decline with the exception of service across the board. And most notably, of course, in compute and mobility, as those markets we've talked about, we see a supply and demand imbalance, as well as Automotive and Industrial. So really, it's across the board from a decline perspective, is our view. \nTimothy Arcuri : Okay. Okay. Got it. And then I guess, Greg, since you're taking over for the company, I know you've been running IA. And I guess the indictment I would have over the past 5 -- well, really more like 7 years in IA, the growth expectations sort of have consistently been downticking since 2017 or 2018. And I get there's been a ton of macro headwinds.  But can you just sort of take a step back and sort of assess maybe the competitive element in the market? Do you think some of it is competition? I know you'd like to maybe do some M&A, it sounds like in IA. So I think some -- I mean I just get a lot of questions from folks that just question whether there really is as much growth in IA as you think there is because the model does keep on pushing out. \nGreg Smith: Yes. So it's a really good question. The thing that I would note is the growth of the collaborative robotics, including AMRs, has been slower than we or other players in the market or analysts have predicted. So essentially, the TAM has grown at a slower rate than we were originally envisioning. So there are other competitive entries in the field, but in general, what we're seeing is that they're sort of raising the profile of the market and potentially helping to accelerate how fast we increase market penetration overall. So especially in cobots, where we have a really strong share position, we think that market entrants are both sort of a blessing and a curse, that they are certainly giving customers options to compare.  We think we've got a good product, and we believe that we're going to be able to hold our share despite those entrants. And that's going to sort of increase market awareness and help to accelerate the growth of the whole market. In AMRs, it's much more of a toss-up, that we are one of the leaders in that market, but their -- the share is spread quite wide. And the market is still forming and people are still figuring out how to really make money in that space. We think we have a winning strategy over the midterm for that, but we have less certainty of the market growth in AMRs. So our plan is to take both of those things into account. But to sort of sum up, the growth has been slower in TAM. We don't think that it's a sign of loss of share due to competition. \nOperator: Our next question has come from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. \nC.J. Muse: First off, Mark, congrats. And we'll miss seeing you on Valentine's Day, but I'm sure you'll find better dates from here. But first question, for SOC test market share in '23, I guess I would love to hear your thoughts on the moving parts. It looks like roughly 37% share in '22, which was a very off year for your Cupertino account. What kind of recovery are you assuming there? And I guess, what kind of offset on the negative side should we be thinking around Eagle from the slowdown in Auto, Industrial? Would love to hear your thoughts there. \nGreg Smith: Sure. No, it's a good question. We're very cautious about making predictions about 2023. We have a reasonable line of sight, but a lot of uncertainty around even just the first half. In the second half, there are some things that could break our way and could drive both the market larger and our share higher. And there has also been -- in 2022, there's been quite strong buying in compute with traditional customers that has tended to push our share down. So I can't really give you sort of a target number for share in 2023, but we believe that we're going to see some share recovery. \nC.J. Muse: Very helpful. And then maybe more importantly, as you think about the underlying growth trends for SOC test, can you speak to 2024? And if you kind of had to rank-order the positive drivers for your business, whether it's 3-nanometer, a recovery in auto, hyperscalers starting to really expand, could you kind of walk through the 3 most important drivers that we should be thinking about into 2024? \nGreg Smith: Yes. So I think you hit many of them. So I think that we are more bullish about 2024 than we are about 2023, certainly. There's -- it's a cloudy crystal ball to try and figure out what's going on. But the positive drivers, I think you hit an important one, that 3-nanometer is going to have much broader adoption across the industry, and 3-nanometer enables a significant increase in device complexity. That's always been a really good driver for ATE TAM. The hyperscalers and automakers, we think that, that is going to be a -- we tend to think of it more as a share gain opportunity than a real TAM driver. So if you think about -- the end market has a demand for a certain number of semiconductors, those semiconductors are going to come from traditional suppliers or these vertically integrated producers. We think that we have an opportunity to do well with that class of customers and potentially shift some share.  Overall, I think I hit kind of the high points around AI, cloud computing, a recovery in mobile and especially increasing semiconductor content in automotive. The one thing that could happen in 2024 is we're seeing unit declines in smartphones in 2023. And typically, if people take time off, if they slow down their refresh cycle for their phones, the following year tends to have a little bit more positive task to it. So that may also help with the rebound. \nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan. \nSamik Chatterjee : I guess for the first one, I know you're sort of seeing the test market, particularly on the SOC side, being down, particularly in the first half. But -- I mean, you called this sort of the early part of a down cycle as well. But when you sort of rely on your experience going through prior down cycles, how would you sort of think about the recovery path between the different pieces here? Like should we expect memory test to sort of rebound sooner? Or are there certain pieces of SOC that you would expect to sort of rebound a bit faster than the others? How should we think about sort of the recovery path? And then I have a follow-up. \nGreg Smith: That's interesting subtlety. So I think your question is really, how should we expect the shape of the recovery? Do we expect it to come first in SOC, first in memory? The first thing that I'll say is that, right now, it appears that the SOC market is impacted more than the memory market in terms of 2023 TAM. And that's mainly because of these technology transitions in memory that are driving tester purchases, even though there isn't a need for more capacity.  What that says to me is that, when there is a recovery, it's probably more likely to be SOC-led than memory-led because there's sort of a capacity overage in memory that is going to need to be absorbed as the end market for memory recovers. So that's just my opinion. I think it's pretty murky. So it could turn out a different way. But I think SOC is likely to snap back a little faster and harder than memory would. \nSamik Chatterjee : Okay. And for a follow-up, and I apologize if you've discussed this already on the call, I jumped a bit late. But in terms of sort of your expectations for what sounds like a bit better sort of second half versus first half, I mean, is -- how much of that is driven by sort of one of the primary customers moving to 3-nanometer? And have you -- are you able to provide a split of how you're thinking about sort of first half versus second half in terms of revenue?\nSanjay Mehta: All right. It's Sanjay here. Yes, I think from a revenue perspective, right now, our plans in the first half, as we provided, are lower, obviously, than the second half of '22. And we do expect an increase through the year really tied to IA and including in Semi Test. And we do expect that to occur in the SOC market as well. \nGreg Smith: Yes. But we're not able to sort of predict a 2023 in full, so we really can't give you an exact percentage, this percent first half, this percent second half. We're cautiously optimistic that it will be bigger. \nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Brian Chin with Stifel. \nBrian Chin: Again, best of luck, Mark. And Greg, congratulations and look forward to working more with you. Maybe first question, just to clarify on the complexity. You outlined again that you expect your largest customer to grow year-over-year and expect -- I believe that complexity-driven revenue will occur mostly in the second half of the year. And so while the sizing sounds fairly similar, is this later than you anticipated maybe 3 months ago from a timing perspective? And just how would you describe why that those shipments could occur later towards the second half versus sort of maybe in 2Q, but where I might normally expect it to be concentrated? \nGreg Smith: Yes. Thanks, Brian. Yes. I think it is a bit later than we've seen in some other years. Our customer always tends to firm up their demand during the second quarter. But oftentimes, they have sort of a directional idea of what they'll need. I think the combination of softness in the smartphone end market and this technology transition is pushing those decisions a little bit later in the year. But that's sort of our outside observation. \nBrian Chin: Got it. And I mean this is probably just geared up to a plan at the moment, which obviously is subject to change or revision. But do you have sort of a -- or could you give us a sense of where test cell utilization is broadly across our device end markets? Maybe where you think it gets to by midyear and where it could end the year, based on your current planning?\nGreg Smith: Yes. So it's -- measuring utilization is something that's challenging to do, and so the absolute numbers aren't perfectly trustworthy. The thing that we try to do is we try to use the sort of a consistent method to look at it each quarter, so that we can trust the deltas. So if things are moving down, then that's not great. If things are moving up, then that is a good leading indicator. And what we've seen across the fourth quarter of 2022 is that utilization is declining, especially in OSATs. It's helped -- holding up a little bit better inside of IDMs. And we are -- we expect it to sort of bottom out around where it is, and potentially, utilization to increase through the back half of this year. But it's definitely softened in the second half of '22. \nBrian Chin: Got it. I appreciate the comment. Maybe if I could just sneak one thing on Automation. Greg, you provide a growth rate for the OEM business through UR, 26% last year. Can you give us a sense of how large that is, the significance relative to UR sales? And also, is that margin profile similar or different relative to traditional channels? \nGreg Smith: Let me take that in backwards order. So the margin in the OEM channel right now is the same or better than our traditional channels. So that is a potential operating margin improvement for that business. In terms of the portion of sales, if I'm recalling correctly, I think it was 16% of UR sales in 2022, but we probably should double check that number. \nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. \nToshiya Hari: The weakness in SOC test this year, Greg, you mentioned it was pretty broad-based. I guess I'm a little surprised that Eagle Test, Auto and Industrial could be weak as well, just given how your customers sound as of today. Are you seeing weakness kick in, in the near term? Or are you embedding some sort of conservatism as you progress into the second half? \nGreg Smith: Yes. We're -- I think it's safe to say that we're baking in conservatism into the 2023 plan for Automotive and Industrial. It's been a very, very strong year for that in 2022, and it sustained very well through the whole year and into the first quarter. But we've definitely modeled declines in that market as well. \nToshiya Hari: Got it. And then as my follow-up, a high-level question for you, Greg. I know you've been with the company for a long time, you've partnered with Mark for a long time. From a top-down kind of strategy standpoint, how you manage the portfolio? How you think about capital allocation? Buybacks versus M&A? What do you intend to inherit? And what are some of the changes you might introduce going forward? \nGreg Smith: Yes. So it's an interesting question because I helped to bake this cake. The strategy that we have in terms of a capital allocation strategy that prioritizes M&A, share buybacks, dividends, nothing is going to change in terms of that strategy. The thing that's happened is we've been on the sidelines since 2019 in terms of M&A, mainly because when we did our analysis of the valuations, it didn't seem like we would be able to do something that was beneficial to our shareholders by using our capital in that way. It's a different market now. And we assume that valuations are going to become more reasonable. And so you may see different outcomes across the next few years than you've seen in the past few years. That's not a reflection of a change in strategy, it's more of a change in the business conditions. \nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. \nVivek Arya : Congratulations and best wishes to both Mark and Greg. For my first one, from what you have described about the different segments, it seems like full-year sales are in the ballpark of being down 10% to 15% year-on-year. I just wanted to make sure I'm in the ballpark. And if yes, I wanted to check how you expect your mobility sales to do this year versus last year. \nSanjay Mehta: It's Sanjay, Vivek. Thanks for the question. Yes, we do expect full-year sales to be down. And really, as you can see with our first quarter guide and our comments throughout the call, visibility is really unclear in the second half. And that's something we've learned from prior downturns, the depth and the duration of this downturn is questionable. So it's really challenging to provide a full-year view. But I would give you the directional -- yes, we agree. We expect it to be down.  From a mobility perspective, again, in earlier questions, how do we view the TAM? We view the TAM in mobility to come down. And again, our revenues are expected to come down as well, as that market significantly, we believe, is softer, just given the inventory in the channel and demand coming down and volume. \nVivek Arya : Got it. And for my follow-up, I'm curious, for the 3-nanometer transition, do I absolutely need new testers? Or is it possible to just reuse existing tester capacity? \nGreg Smith: Yes. Vivek, that's an excellent question. So unlike the memory market or the Wireless Test market, where you need new equipment for new standards, and that drives replacements, in node transitions like 3-nanometer, for the most part, the installed capacity is perfectly capable of testing the new part. And so the tester demand is really driven by increased complexity.  So if you are testing a part that takes longer to test, you're going to need to add to your test capacity, test the part on both the stuff you already own and then the new testers that you buy. And so we look really carefully at how much of the industry is on a particular node because that drives basically the number of transistors that have to get tested. So it's definitely -- there's a high degree of reuse in the SOC market as nodes transition.\nVivek Arya : Got it. So there is a scenario where, if 3-nanometer volumes are low enough, that they don't really need to buy new testers in the back half, right? \nGreg Smith: Yes. That's certainly one scenario. It's not our current best view, but things could certainly play out that way because of this balance of units versus complexity. \nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Krish Sankar with Cowen. \nKrish Sankar: Mark, thanks for all your help, and welcome, Greg. Two quick questions. First one, Sanjay, you mentioned about gross margins in the back half of the year kind of going back up. Kind of curious, what gives you that comfort, especially given the fact that if auto does roll over, those are high-margin Eagle testers that get out of your profitability equation? So I'm just kind of curious on the second half gross margin. And then I have a follow-up. \nSanjay Mehta: Sure. Thanks for the question. So I think a couple of things are included in our plan. The first thing is we expect to gain some operational efficiencies, some tied to specific programs, I would say, mainly in our IA portfolio. There are also some price increases baked into our -- that are rolling through in the second half, and some volume that is anticipated in the second half. \nKrish Sankar: Got it. Very helpful. And then as a follow-up, maybe for Greg. Kind of curious, in the past, you folks have mentioned how -- I understand you're not impacted by some of these China export controls because it's more of a front end. But the Chinese OSATs have been a big component of your China sales, and they might also see a slowdown if some of your front-end counterparts are seeing weakness. I'm kind of curious how to think about China on a go-forward basis, especially given the fact that through 2021 and the first half of 2022, Chinese OSATs seemed to have ordered a lot of equipment. \nGreg Smith: Yes. So that's -- it's a good question because most of the business that's going through Chinese OSATs, it comes from 2 places. There are local Chinese fabless specifiers that are driving volume through that value chain. And then there's also companies that are from other places that are utilizing those facilities. What we expect is that, if there are issues in terms of producing chips in China because of any sort of restrictions, the non-Chinese specifiers will move their supply chains. They still need to build their chips. They will move to other parts of the world, other facilities to do that. The indigenous Chinese sales, that could be affected by the new trade regulations that are in place. But I'd like to point out that, that's not the majority of our revenue in China, and it's not the majority of the business that -- of the TAM in China. So our exposure there is limited to probably less than 5% of our total revenues. \nOperator: Our next questions come from the line of Vedvati Shrotre with Jefferies. \nVedvati Shrotre: So I just wanted to dig in a little bit on the compute SOC side of things. So you mentioned that you're seeing a lot of digestion that's going on in the traditional x86 markets, where you have lower share. So does that, in a way, put you in a better position? Are you seeing things -- are things different on the hyperscalers versus the traditional x86 architectures? \nGreg Smith: So that's a really good question because 2022 was a terrific year for traditional compute suppliers, and they drove a lot of tester purchases. We are seeing that soften in the back half of the year, and we expect that to remain soft, going into 2023.  The new vertically integrated producers, including hyperscalers, are running to it on a different track. They have new parts that they're designing, that they're releasing to production. And those parts typically need different tester configurations that are driving capacity in different places than the traditional compute specifiers. So we do think that, that's going to be a stronger part of the compute market in 2023 than the traditional -- there'll be softness in the traditional market. \nVedvati Shrotre: That's great. And then for my follow-up. On the automotive side, there's, I think, portion of your revenues are tied to legacy parts and some would be more on the ADAS side of things. Could you help me understand like what that split is, essentially? Is it a 50-50 split? Or is it more levered to traditional and less towards ADAS or other way around? \nGreg Smith: Yes. So it's definitely a market in transition. If you look back in time, legacy automotive parts, airbag controllers, engine controllers and MCUs, was sort of the majority of that market. And last year, that market would have been in the $600 million to $800 million range. There are new part types, and there are 2 types of new part types. One are ADAS, which are complex digital devices. And the other would be power devices for battery management and for high-power management going into electric motors, in EVs and hybrid vehicles.  That part is, in 2022, would probably have been maybe 2/3 of the size of the traditional automotive. Well, actually -- so the number that I gave you in terms of the size of the automotive market includes these new classes, and I would say that in 2022, it was probably a little bit more than half in these new stuff that's growing, the EV and ADAS, and slightly less than half in legacy. Moving forward, we expect the legacy stuff to track vehicle sales. So as vehicle sales increase, that would increase at a relatively slow rate. But the adoption of ADAS and the transition from internal combustion to electric vehicles is going to drive much higher growth rates in ADAS and power. \nAndrew Blanchard : And operator, can we sneak in just one last question, please? Operator Our final questions come from the line of Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. \nSidney Ho : I just have one question. So you talked about your largest customer going from less than 10% of sales to, I think, ['22]. So call it $300 million, going to low double digits in '23. So maybe $100 million increase. But that's still quite a bit lower than in 2021. First, are those numbers right? And second, do you think that this, call it, $400 million range is the correct run rate, going forward, but maybe with less volatility than in the past? \nGreg Smith: Yes. So I don't think I want to comment on the specific numbers. But directionally, I think you're not wrong. And your comment about smoothing out the troughs, that's our belief as well. As to what the sort of steady state average is, I think we're going to have to wait and see.  We're pretty -- we have some optimism that, that average is going to be strong because of both new parts coming into the portfolio and the transition of the portfolio of all processors going to 3-nanometer and continuing to march in that way. So that's -- I think that's kind of our view, that we have some optimism that the peaks are going to be lower, the overall is going to be stronger. \nAndrew Blanchard : All right, folks. And we've overstayed our welcome. So thank you so much for joining us today, and we look forward to talking with you in the weeks ahead. And those remaining in the queue, I'll get back to you later this morning. Thanks so much. \nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. We appreciate your participation.",

            "name": "Mark Jagiela",
            "content": "Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us this morning. I'm going to limit my remarks today as Greg will be taking full leadership of the company from next week. I'll leave the outlook to Greg, and Sanjay will provide the financial details, including our updated midterm earnings model.  2022 was another good year for Teradyne with our second highest sales in history. Midyear, we saw a turn in our markets with the SOC test market softening after 6 years of growth and Industrial Automation growth slowing.  At the company level, our financial results were slightly under the long-term trend line after operating well above trend in 2020 and 2021. This oscillation around the trend line is a familiar pattern that we expect to continue. We manage our business investments according to this trend line and tend not to chase these excursions up or down. Sanjay will note how these trend lines roll into our updated midterm earnings model.  Looking at a longer-term perspective, over the last 8 years, Teradyne's revenue has about doubled and EPS has grown about 4x. Growth of our core test markets is part of the story, as is expansion into new markets like Industrial Automation and System Level Test. This, combined with a rich cash flow and a balanced capital allocation plan, has been the recipe for shareholder returns. As you will hear, we see all of these drivers remaining in place for the years to come.  Since this is my last earnings call, I would like to thank all of you who follow, invest and influence our journey at Teradyne. As Greg takes on the role, I'm confident we won't miss a beat, and he's been a key part of developing and implementing our strategy for many years.  With that, I'll turn things over to Greg for his deeper perspective on our results and outlook. Greg? And maybe, Mehdi, thank you for those kind comments. I'll just make one quick comment on your first point, which is every downturn cycle, as we try to measure, it's different. But if you classify it around when does the imbalance between semiconductor supply and demand start to inflect and cause an industry-wide downturn, from that point of view, we see it as something that started last summer. So that's how -- why we mark it back to that date."
        },
        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Greg Smith",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will summarize the full year of 2022 and then comment on our early view of 2023. For the full year, we delivered sales of $3.155 billion and non-GAAP earnings of $4.25 per share.  2022 was the second-highest revenue in company history but down 15% from 2021's record level due mainly to reduced demand in SOC test, specifically in mobility and compute. This offset was -- this was offset somewhat by strength in the automotive end market, including substantial demand for ADAS processor test. Overall for 2022, we estimate the SOC test market was about $4.6 billion, down 6% from '21, and the memory market was down a similar amount for the year. Industrial Automation grew about 7% in dollar terms. Foreign exchange was a major headwind in that business. Our growth was 15% in constant currency.  I'll divide my comments on market conditions into an early view of 2023, followed by our outlook for the midterm. In July of last year, we noted the Semi Test equipment market was entering a downturn, with demand declining in end markets such as smartphones. This began to create chip supply/demand and inventory imbalances.  We noted these types of corrections typically have a 4- to 6-quarter duration. Now we're a bit more than 2 quarters in, and as the downturn continues, our customers continue to rebalance their production and inventory with end market demand. Much of the imbalance is in test-intensive end markets like smartphones, compute and networking, where we see lower utilization. At this point in time, with limited visibility into the second half, we estimate a market size for SOC tests to be 10% to 30% below 2022's $4.6 billion level. Major SOC producers are expected to start the transition to 3-nanometer later in 2023, and this could mitigate the headwinds a bit.  Our historically largest end customer is expected to lead this transition, and revenue driven by this customer is expected to grow in 2023, moving from less than 10% of our revenue in 2022 to low double-digit percents of revenue for this year. Demand won't be finalized until Q2 and will be weighted towards the second half of the year.  In general, our models factor in 2 key demand drivers, unit volume and device complexity. We've read the same press reports that you have, that smartphone volumes are likely to be down in 2023. The complexity growth associated with the 3-nanometer transition is likely to offset the test demand impact of the unit decrease, and the net effect is the increase in revenue that I've described. Our assumption that this transition is going to be gradual is likely to mute the peaks, but it will also fill in the troughs as the full portfolio migrates to 3-nanometer.  Overall, averaging across the entire life of a process node, like 5-nanometer or 3-nanometer, we expect that each new node will drive continued higher test investment in total than the prior node. On top of that, increased unit growth and the addition of new part types to the portfolio will drive further increases in test investment.  In the memory test market, technology transitions continue to drive demand. Faster interface speeds in DRAM with DDR5 and in flash with UFS 4.0 cannot be tested on existing testers and are driving purchases of next-generation ATE. Offsetting this technology-driven replacement demand is a difficult end market for our memory customers, which is likely to reduce capacity buying for this year. We are seeing some impact of that in the first quarter.  On balance, we expect the memory test market size to be flat to slightly down from 2022. We expect Storage Test will be weak in 2023 due to excess capacity in the HDD end market. And Wireless Test demand will be soft on lower smartphone shipments and a demand lull in advance of the transition to WiFi 7 beginning in 2024. Shifting to Industrial Automation. As we expected, the macro-outlook in industrial markets is cautious, with weak industrial PMIs. We expect this will be a growth headwind in the first half of the year. Rolling up these headwinds and offsetting factors over the first half of the year, our current judgment for the total company has our second quarter about flat with Q1. However, in Industrial Automation for the full year, we have 3 notable factors that should help offset these headwinds later in the year.  First, we do not expect the currency exchange impacts we experienced in 2022. Second, growth initiatives that began in 2022, including a channel transformation at UR, will gain traction. One component of the channel transformation is supplementing our traditional distributor channel with a focused OEM channel. That effort delivered 26% growth in 2022, and we expect this to continue in 2023 as our existing OEM partners continue to grow and we add additional OEMs and targeted verticals.  The third factor driving IA growth is expanding the served market through new products. Most notably, in 2023, shipments of the new long-reach, heavy-payload cobot at Universal Robots, the UR20, which will ramp in the second half of the year. Barring a significant deterioration in the macro economy and reasonably stable currencies, we expect channel expansion, combined with new products, to drive greater than 20% growth for IA in 2023, weighted to the second half of the year.  Now shifting to the midterm outlook. The short-term changes in customer buying patterns in semi cap equipment can be abrupt. We built our flexible operating model to accommodate those cycles. Our midterm plans track the long-term historical trends and the future demand drivers in each of our businesses rather than the short-term cycles. In any given year, we will land above or below trend, but that trend line has provided a reliable baseline for planning.  Sanjay will be going through a quantitative view of our 2026 earnings model. To set up that discussion, I'd like to make a few qualitative comments to provide some context. Our 2026 earnings model shows significant revenue and EPS growth, and it's reasonable to ask why we assume midterm growth when the short-term environment is so weak. There are several factors that give us confidence in our midterm outlook. End markets, like AI and cloud computing, mobile processing and automotive, including ADAS and EV, are driving increased semiconductor content and increasing chip complexity.  The deployment of advanced wireless standards will support ever higher data volumes and the pervasive deployment of edge AI. This end market demand will drive the timeline for new semi fab nodes and packaging technologies, like 3-nanometer, chiplets and gate all around.  We have seen these technology transitions drive demand for test as the new nodes enable more complex chips and multichip packaging technologies like chiplets drive higher quality level requirements. Both of these factors drive longer test times and higher ATE TAMs. But the landscape is changing. These complex chips are increasingly developed by a new class of vertically integrated producers, or VIPs, including hyperscalers and automakers.  We've had good design-in success to date with this emerging customer type, and these VIPs provide Teradyne with an opportunity to grow share in a space long dominated by legacy x86 architectures, where our share has historically been lower. These large, complex devices are used in uptime-critical applications and will require exceptionally low defect levels. To achieve this quality level, our customers will increasingly adopt an additional test step, system-level tests or SLT. We have a strong footprint in this growing market, and our design-in success with new customers is expected to be a growth driver over the midterm. Over the midterm, we expect to see WiFi 7 ramp and the rapid expansion of UWB-enabled devices for both precision location tracking and security. These new standards obsolete existing test instrumentation, and this replacement cycle will be a growth engine over the midterm for both SOC test and Wireless Test.  Turning to IA. Global labor shortages and converging regional wages will continue to be unrelenting demand drivers. Market penetration for collaborative robots, including AMRs, is under 5%, providing enormous opportunities for long-term growth.  The steady application of new technologies in our products will continue to expand our served market, and the transformation of our channel will enable us to serve a broader range of customers and drive revenue to the $1 billion level in 2026. Summing it up. Over the midterm, our strong core test businesses will support share gain and trend line growth, while IA will grow to be about 20% of company sales and become a meaningful contributor to earnings.  In 2022, we have planted the seeds for future growth. We expanded our design-in footprint in the vertically integrated producer space and recognized substantial revenues from this emerging market. We expanded our customer base in SLT. We grew our IA sales in challenging business conditions and set the foundation for higher long-term growth at both Universal Robots and [Newark].  We're in a cyclical downturn in the semiconductor capital industry, and visibility in downturns is always a challenge. We expect sales and earnings to be below our midterm trend line in 2023. While we don't have line of sight to an inflection in demand, that's typical in these cycles. The market will recover, and we expect to return to historical growth rates driving strong earnings over our midterm planning horizon, as Sanjay will describe.  Before turning it over to Sanjay, I would like to thank Mark for his more than 40 years of service to Teradyne and his 9 years as CEO. He has steered the company through an extraordinary period in the semiconductor industry and helped to assure our future growth through our investments in robotics.  More personally, it's been an honor to work for Mark during that period. His candor and insight has made me and all of us at Teradyne better. Although we're facing a cyclical downturn, we're facing it as a company with tremendous financial strength, a great team and a clear strategic vision, thanks to Mark.  Now Sanjay? Thanks for the question, Mehdi. Our thought in terms of the Semi Test cycle is that we really don't have great visibility. Where -- we believe we are about 2 quarters in. And one thing to remember is that the peak that you're talking about was well above our trend line. So there was a fair amount of contraction to happen before we got into a region, where we would have considered it to be sort of a true downturn. So we're really measuring from that sort of July of '22 time frame. And we think we are just about 2 quarters into it.  In terms of when it will inflect back up, we really don't have good visibility. There are a number of factors that make us feel a little bit better about the second half of the year than the first. But we don't see the kinds of leading indicators that the demand is returning. So I don't think we can give you a lot more color than that. Yes. So it's a really good question. The thing that I would note is the growth of the collaborative robotics, including AMRs, has been slower than we or other players in the market or analysts have predicted. So essentially, the TAM has grown at a slower rate than we were originally envisioning. So there are other competitive entries in the field, but in general, what we're seeing is that they're sort of raising the profile of the market and potentially helping to accelerate how fast we increase market penetration overall. So especially in cobots, where we have a really strong share position, we think that market entrants are both sort of a blessing and a curse, that they are certainly giving customers options to compare.  We think we've got a good product, and we believe that we're going to be able to hold our share despite those entrants. And that's going to sort of increase market awareness and help to accelerate the growth of the whole market. In AMRs, it's much more of a toss-up, that we are one of the leaders in that market, but their -- the share is spread quite wide. And the market is still forming and people are still figuring out how to really make money in that space. We think we have a winning strategy over the midterm for that, but we have less certainty of the market growth in AMRs. So our plan is to take both of those things into account. But to sort of sum up, the growth has been slower in TAM. We don't think that it's a sign of loss of share due to competition. Sure. No, it's a good question. We're very cautious about making predictions about 2023. We have a reasonable line of sight, but a lot of uncertainty around even just the first half. In the second half, there are some things that could break our way and could drive both the market larger and our share higher. And there has also been -- in 2022, there's been quite strong buying in compute with traditional customers that has tended to push our share down. So I can't really give you sort of a target number for share in 2023, but we believe that we're going to see some share recovery. Yes. So I think you hit many of them. So I think that we are more bullish about 2024 than we are about 2023, certainly. There's -- it's a cloudy crystal ball to try and figure out what's going on. But the positive drivers, I think you hit an important one, that 3-nanometer is going to have much broader adoption across the industry, and 3-nanometer enables a significant increase in device complexity. That's always been a really good driver for ATE TAM. The hyperscalers and automakers, we think that, that is going to be a -- we tend to think of it more as a share gain opportunity than a real TAM driver. So if you think about -- the end market has a demand for a certain number of semiconductors, those semiconductors are going to come from traditional suppliers or these vertically integrated producers. We think that we have an opportunity to do well with that class of customers and potentially shift some share.  Overall, I think I hit kind of the high points around AI, cloud computing, a recovery in mobile and especially increasing semiconductor content in automotive. The one thing that could happen in 2024 is we're seeing unit declines in smartphones in 2023. And typically, if people take time off, if they slow down their refresh cycle for their phones, the following year tends to have a little bit more positive task to it. So that may also help with the rebound. That's interesting subtlety. So I think your question is really, how should we expect the shape of the recovery? Do we expect it to come first in SOC, first in memory? The first thing that I'll say is that, right now, it appears that the SOC market is impacted more than the memory market in terms of 2023 TAM. And that's mainly because of these technology transitions in memory that are driving tester purchases, even though there isn't a need for more capacity.  What that says to me is that, when there is a recovery, it's probably more likely to be SOC-led than memory-led because there's sort of a capacity overage in memory that is going to need to be absorbed as the end market for memory recovers. So that's just my opinion. I think it's pretty murky. So it could turn out a different way. But I think SOC is likely to snap back a little faster and harder than memory would. Yes. But we're not able to sort of predict a 2023 in full, so we really can't give you an exact percentage, this percent first half, this percent second half. We're cautiously optimistic that it will be bigger. Yes. Thanks, Brian. Yes. I think it is a bit later than we've seen in some other years. Our customer always tends to firm up their demand during the second quarter. But oftentimes, they have sort of a directional idea of what they'll need. I think the combination of softness in the smartphone end market and this technology transition is pushing those decisions a little bit later in the year. But that's sort of our outside observation. Yes. So it's -- measuring utilization is something that's challenging to do, and so the absolute numbers aren't perfectly trustworthy. The thing that we try to do is we try to use the sort of a consistent method to look at it each quarter, so that we can trust the deltas. So if things are moving down, then that's not great. If things are moving up, then that is a good leading indicator. And what we've seen across the fourth quarter of 2022 is that utilization is declining, especially in OSATs. It's helped -- holding up a little bit better inside of IDMs. And we are -- we expect it to sort of bottom out around where it is, and potentially, utilization to increase through the back half of this year. But it's definitely softened in the second half of '22. Let me take that in backwards order. So the margin in the OEM channel right now is the same or better than our traditional channels. So that is a potential operating margin improvement for that business. In terms of the portion of sales, if I'm recalling correctly, I think it was 16% of UR sales in 2022, but we probably should double check that number. Yes. We're -- I think it's safe to say that we're baking in conservatism into the 2023 plan for Automotive and Industrial. It's been a very, very strong year for that in 2022, and it sustained very well through the whole year and into the first quarter. But we've definitely modeled declines in that market as well. Yes. So it's an interesting question because I helped to bake this cake. The strategy that we have in terms of a capital allocation strategy that prioritizes M&A, share buybacks, dividends, nothing is going to change in terms of that strategy. The thing that's happened is we've been on the sidelines since 2019 in terms of M&A, mainly because when we did our analysis of the valuations, it didn't seem like we would be able to do something that was beneficial to our shareholders by using our capital in that way. It's a different market now. And we assume that valuations are going to become more reasonable. And so you may see different outcomes across the next few years than you've seen in the past few years. That's not a reflection of a change in strategy, it's more of a change in the business conditions. Yes. Vivek, that's an excellent question. So unlike the memory market or the Wireless Test market, where you need new equipment for new standards, and that drives replacements, in node transitions like 3-nanometer, for the most part, the installed capacity is perfectly capable of testing the new part. And so the tester demand is really driven by increased complexity.  So if you are testing a part that takes longer to test, you're going to need to add to your test capacity, test the part on both the stuff you already own and then the new testers that you buy. And so we look really carefully at how much of the industry is on a particular node because that drives basically the number of transistors that have to get tested. So it's definitely -- there's a high degree of reuse in the SOC market as nodes transition. Yes. That's certainly one scenario. It's not our current best view, but things could certainly play out that way because of this balance of units versus complexity. Yes. So that's -- it's a good question because most of the business that's going through Chinese OSATs, it comes from 2 places. There are local Chinese fabless specifiers that are driving volume through that value chain. And then there's also companies that are from other places that are utilizing those facilities. What we expect is that, if there are issues in terms of producing chips in China because of any sort of restrictions, the non-Chinese specifiers will move their supply chains. They still need to build their chips. They will move to other parts of the world, other facilities to do that. The indigenous Chinese sales, that could be affected by the new trade regulations that are in place. But I'd like to point out that, that's not the majority of our revenue in China, and it's not the majority of the business that -- of the TAM in China. So our exposure there is limited to probably less than 5% of our total revenues. So that's a really good question because 2022 was a terrific year for traditional compute suppliers, and they drove a lot of tester purchases. We are seeing that soften in the back half of the year, and we expect that to remain soft, going into 2023.  The new vertically integrated producers, including hyperscalers, are running to it on a different track. They have new parts that they're designing, that they're releasing to production. And those parts typically need different tester configurations that are driving capacity in different places than the traditional compute specifiers. So we do think that, that's going to be a stronger part of the compute market in 2023 than the traditional -- there'll be softness in the traditional market. Yes. So it's definitely a market in transition. If you look back in time, legacy automotive parts, airbag controllers, engine controllers and MCUs, was sort of the majority of that market. And last year, that market would have been in the $600 million to $800 million range. There are new part types, and there are 2 types of new part types. One are ADAS, which are complex digital devices. And the other would be power devices for battery management and for high-power management going into electric motors, in EVs and hybrid vehicles.  That part is, in 2022, would probably have been maybe 2/3 of the size of the traditional automotive. Well, actually -- so the number that I gave you in terms of the size of the automotive market includes these new classes, and I would say that in 2022, it was probably a little bit more than half in these new stuff that's growing, the EV and ADAS, and slightly less than half in legacy. Moving forward, we expect the legacy stuff to track vehicle sales. So as vehicle sales increase, that would increase at a relatively slow rate. But the adoption of ADAS and the transition from internal combustion to electric vehicles is going to drive much higher growth rates in ADAS and power. Yes. So I don't think I want to comment on the specific numbers. But directionally, I think you're not wrong. And your comment about smoothing out the troughs, that's our belief as well. As to what the sort of steady state average is, I think we're going to have to wait and see.  We're pretty -- we have some optimism that, that average is going to be strong because of both new parts coming into the portfolio and the transition of the portfolio of all processors going to 3-nanometer and continuing to march in that way. So that's -- I think that's kind of our view, that we have some optimism that the peaks are going to be lower, the overall is going to be stronger."

After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to introduce Vice President of Investor Relations, Andy Blanchard.\nAndy Blanchard: Thank you, Andrew. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our discussion of Teradyne\u2019s most recent financial results. I\u2019m joined this morning by our CEO, Mark Jagiela; President, Greg Smith; and our CFO, Sanjay Mehta. Following our opening remarks, we\u2019ll provide details of our performance for 2022\u2019s third quarter along with our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2022. The press release containing our third quarter results was issued last evening. We\u2019re providing slides on the Investor page of the website that may be helpful to you in following the discussion. Replays of this call will be available via the same page after the call ends. The matters that we discuss today will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause Teradyne\u2019s results to differ materially from management\u2019s current expectations. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statement contained in the earnings release as well as our most recent SEC filings. Additionally, those forward-looking statements are made as of today, and we take no obligation to update them as a result of developments occurring after this call. During today\u2019s call, we\u2019ll make reference to non-GAAP financial measures. We\u2019ve posted additional information concerning these non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure were available on the Investor page of our website. Looking ahead between now and our next earnings call, Teradyne expects to participate in technology or industrial-focused investor conferences hosted by Baird, Credit Suisse and UBS. Now let\u2019s get on with the rest of the agenda. First, Mark and Greg will comment on our recent results and the market conditions as we enter the new quarter. Sanjay will then offer more details on our quarterly results along with our guidance for the fourth quarter. We\u2019ll then answer your questions and this call is scheduled for one hour. Mark?\nMark Jagiela: Thanks, Andy. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us this morning. In today\u2019s call, Greg will review our 3Q results and 4Q outlook. I\u2019ll then describe the longer term view, and Sanjay will provide the financial details of the quarter. Greg?\nGreg Smith: Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Teradyne\u2019s third quarter sales and profits were above the midpoint of our guidance in revenue and profit with sales of $827 million and $1.15 in non-GAAP earnings per share. At the company level, the quarter unfolded generally as planned, but at the operating level, we cleared some supply bottlenecks, which allowed us to ship more semiconductor test products than planned in the quarter. On the other hand, industrial automation was weaker than we forecast in July. Putting the third quarter into context. When we spoke in July, we noted that slowing SOC and wireless tester demand in the second half were related to declines in the end market shipments of smartphones, compute products and associated infrastructure. With that backdrop, we reduced our estimate for the SOC market size and reduced our second half shipment plan approximately $300 million. About one-third of that amount was already confirmed in June and about two-thirds, $200 million was our judgment on how the second half would unfold. In the subsequent three months, about $110 million of the $200 million additional decline was realized and about $90 million was not as overall test demand held up better than we expected in July. This incremental strength and test has been partially offset by weaker IA demand as reflected in the Q4 guidance. The highlight in Semi Test is the continued strength in automotive test demand. This year, we\u2019re seeing a step increase in our shipments for ADAS processors, silicon carbide drive and charging ICs and battery management devices. Our UltraFLEX platform is well aligned to the unique requirements of multibillion transistor ADAS processors and our Eagle platform is well suited for the thousands of volts and hundreds of amps often required for silicon carbide devices. It\u2019s notable that these three device types collectively will add over $100 million of incremental SOC TAM in 2022 and they were insignificant five years ago. Shifting now to industrial automation. Because only about 30% of our sales are transacted in dollars and there have been significant changes in exchange rates in 2022, will describe results in both constant currency and dollar terms. In constant currency, Automation Group Q3 revenue grew 7% from last year\u2019s Q3 and is up 19% for the first nine months of the year. In dollar terms, however, revenue contracted 2% in the quarter compared with Q3 2021 and growth is 11% for the first nine months. Looking at the full year, we expect IA growth from 2021 will be about 6% in dollar terms at the midpoint of our Q4 guidance. In constant currency terms, IA growth will come in at about 14%. Even using constant currency terms, this is below our 2022 plan to grow in the mid-30s, from the 2021 level and reflects two additional factors. First, slowing industrial activity, especially in Europe, where PMIs dropped below 50 in July and have remained in that contraction zone since. Europe is our largest end market for automation and this is a 10-point headwind to growth. Second, labor scarcity continues in our distribution channel, which we expect to reduce growth by about five points. While 2022 growth is below our plan, we have a number of bright spots in IA, and I will highlight just a few. At Universal Robots, customer demand for our higher payload, longer-reach UR20 has been stronger than expected since its introduction mid-year, and we expect it to be a meaningful contributor to results when it begins shipping in 2023. The UR20 expands our capability in the palletizing, welding and machine tending end markets. Also, we\u2019ve continued to grow our OEM channel at UR including supporting partner expansion from national to international sales coverage. The OEM channel is a powerful growth driver for us. For example, our welding channel grew over 80% in the first nine months compared with last year. And for this year, we expect to ship well over 1,200 robots in that vertical. At MiR, our sales to large customers continue to expand with more than 30 customers having fleet sizes greater than 20 robots. The number of customers with these large fleets has increased 30% in 2022. This is significant as our fleet management software is an increasingly important differentiator as fleet sizes grow. On a related note, at the end of Q3 we merged AutoGuide into MiR as we prepare to offer customers a broad payload range from hundreds to thousands of kilograms sold by the same team using the same fleet management software backed by the same global distribution \u2013 same global network of distributors, all while increasing our engineering, marketing and back-office leverage. Finally, MiR service and spares revenue has more than doubled to about 5% of revenue through the first nine months compared with 2021 as we begin to expand our customer support offering. Across Industrial Automation, the investments we\u2019re continuing to make are giving us the foundation to support high growth with differentiated products to global customers through multiple distribution channels. While we are not satisfied with 2022\u2019s growth rate and have taken actions to improve, we remain confident of our long-term strategy in these growing markets. With that, I\u2019ll now pass it back to Mark.\nMark Jagiela: Thanks, Greg. I\u2019ll comment on the longer-term view of our markets and the impact of changes in the regulatory environment. Although better than estimated in our July call, the demand has slowed across our test markets as we enter Q4. As I noted at the time, predicting the depth and duration of these corrections is challenging, but in each of the last three corrections, growth has returned after 6 months to 12 months. We haven\u2019t seen anything in the last three months to change that view. So while it\u2019s too early to offer estimates on 2023 full year market size, based on the historical patterns and current market conditions, we expect next year\u2019s first quarter and first half demand to remain relatively weak. That, combined with the weak macro environment in industrial markets suggest that our Q1 revenue will likely be about 10% softer than Q4. Looking at the full year 2023, it\u2019s too early to make quantitative predictions but I\u2019ll point out how we\u2019re thinking about the balloons and anchors for the year ahead. First, the balloons. We expect the semiconductor industry to begin to transition to 3-nanometer technology and our largest customer to grow from less than 10% of company sales in 2022 to more than 10% next year. However, we expect them to be at a lower than historical past peak level as 3-nanometer will not hit full stride until 2024. In Industrial Automation, we also expect to grow year-over-year with the exact amount governed by macro conditions. Balancing these balloons are a few anchors. Semiconductor unit volumes and revenue are expected to decline in 2023 due to inventory digestion and macro headwinds. In Industrial Automation, slowing industrial growth worldwide and a pronounced slowdown in European manufacturing are additional anchors. So we\u2019re keeping a balanced view of next year, and we should have a better view of the full year in January. Looking longer-term, the case for growth in both Test and IA remains intact and compelling. In Semi Test, we\u2019re operating on a market growth trend line of 10% since 2017. Growth in our test businesses is driven by unit growth and complexity. We expect those drivers to remain in place as new semiconductor technologies such as 3-nanometer, gate all around and chiplets ramp over the next few years. These technology building blocks enable applications to continue to grow in complexity, including emerging applications like AI, ADAS and new compute architectures. In Industrial Automation, we remain bullish on the future. While we\u2019re not immune to macro conditions, we recognize the underlying drivers of demand are favorable for Cobot and AMR automation. Labor demographics and economics and the growing range of tasks our Cobots can perform ensures an expanding market opportunity, and our strategy enables us to capitalize on that opportunity for many years to come. Regarding the recent changes in trade regulations, indigenous Chinese memory makers have been a significant and growing part of our memory business. And while the new regulations mainly focus on fab equipment rather than test, tighter restrictions, combined with potential reduction in their wafer volume will likely impact our business. This situation is dynamic, but as of now, we see these regulations as about a $75 million to $100 million headwind going into 2023. On the supply side of the trade equation, we have a large manufacturing footprint in China, and our global support team has a professional services operation in place to support local and global customers. As part of our resiliency planning, we have been enabling additional global sites for these activities. Given the current environment, we will be accelerating the capacity growth of these other sites. Sanjay will take you through more details of those plans. Stepping back to look at the full year. Despite the drop in demand in the second half, we\u2019re on track to deliver our second highest revenue in history. We\u2019ve balanced our growth investments with financial discipline and we positioned Teradyne for high growth as our core test and IA markets improve. Sanjay will now take you through the financial details. Sanjay?\nSanjay Mehta: Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Today, I\u2019ll provide details on our Q3 results, update you on the impact of the new trade regulations and describe our Q4 outlook. Now to Q3. Third quarter sales were $827 million, with non-GAAP EPS of $1.15. Non-GAAP gross margins were 58.7% and our non-GAAP operating expenses were $247 million. About flat with second quarter OpEx due to implemented spending controls. Non-GAAP operating profit was 28.8%. We had one, 10% customer in the quarter. The tax rate, excluding discrete items, for the quarter was 18.7% on a non-GAAP basis. Please note, you should now use 17.25% for the full year non-GAAP tax rate. Looking at the results from a business unit perspective. Semi Test revenue was $576 million with SOC revenue contributing $451 million and memory of $125 million. We cleared some supply constraints, which enabled the highest level of memory shipments in the past two years. In memory, the transitions to new memory standards in both flash and DRAM, along with strong demand from indigenous China customers drove the results. In SOC, the increasing semi content for EVs, autonomous driving and infotainment and autos, along with continued strength in analog industrial contributed to the demand. System Test group had revenue of $116 million with Storage Test delivering $70 million in Defense and aerospace and production board test $46 million. In Wireless Test at LitePoint, revenue was $46 million in the quarter, down 33% year-over-year, primarily because of lower WiFi revenue tied to declining PC and smartphone end markets. Now to Industrial Automation. IA revenue was $89 million with UR contributing $73 million and MiR $16 million. MiR results include auto guidance. As Greg noted, a large portion of IA sales are outside the U.S. For the first nine months, 41% of IA sales were in Europe, 29% in the U.S. and 11% in China and the remainder in the rest of the world. From a financial perspective in IA, the group was slightly above breakeven on a non-GAAP operating basis in the third quarter. And for the full year, we expect to be about breakeven. Below the 5% to 15% profit range planned for the group. As growth has slowed this year, we\u2019ve also slowed the growth in OpEx. Shifting to supply. Looking at Q4, we continue to face supply issues, but the supply trend continues to improve relative to three months ago. These supply bottlenecks noted at the beginning of each quarter have moved from $50 million in Q3 to about $15 million in the fourth quarter. These amounts are outside the high end of our guidance range. Switching to a strategic issue. We manufacture certain products and deliver certain engineering services in China for our global customers. While recent U.S. government actions have no immediate impact to these operations, due to concerns about potential future impacts, we are accelerating our strategy to expand our manufacturing and engineering service capabilities in other countries. In manufacturing, this work has been underway for several years and we\u2019re accelerating the work to complete our expansion strategy in the next several quarters. In Engineering Services, the transition will likely take most of 2023 to achieve. Shifting to the balance sheet and cash flow. [Technical Difficulty]\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, please stand by. Your conference will resume momentarily. Please stand by.\nAndy Blanchard: Did John say where we lost it?\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, please stand by. Your conference will resume momentarily.\nAndy Blanchard: Hey, Andrew.\nOperator: Yes, please go ahead.\nAndy Blanchard: All right. We\u2019re ready to go.\nOperator: Yes, we are live with the audience. Please go ahead.\nAndy Blanchard: Back to you Sanjay.\nSanjay Mehta: I\u2019ll go back to shifting to the balance sheet. Shifting to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our cash and marketable securities at the end of the quarter totaled approximately $900 million about flat with Q2. We had $233 million in free cash flow in the quarter and our DSO came down from 74 to 58 days. Uses of cash in the quarter included share buybacks of $217 million, dividend payments of $17 million and debt retirement of $10 million. Due to opportunistic buying through the year, we finished our $750 million share repurchase plan for 2022 full three months ahead of the original schedule. Our Board has authorized continued opportunistic share repurchases in Q4. Since our program began in 2015, we\u2019ve repurchased 74 million shares at an average price of $45.85. Regarding debt, to date, $397 million of convertible bonds have early converted. Now to our revolver. During Q3, we worked with our banking partners and have increased the capacity of the revolver to $750 million from $400 million. Our credit facility is in place until December 2026. Now to our outlook for Q4. As Greg noted, our outlook is ahead of what we expected three months ago, driven mainly by Semi Test. Sales in Q4 are expected to be between $670 million and $750 million with non-GAAP EPS in a range of $0.62 to $0.86 on 164 million diluted shares. Fourth quarter guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles. Fourth quarter gross margins are estimated at 56% to 57% down from Q3 due to lower volume, product mix and spending on accelerated \u2013 on accelerating our manufacturing and service delivery resiliency. OpEx is expected to run at 34% to 38% of fourth quarter sales. On a non-GAAP operating \u2013 the non-GAAP operating profit rate at the midpoint of our fourth quarter guidance is 21%. Looking at the full year of 2022. At the midpoint of our guidance, 2022 revenue will be $3.1 billion with an EPS of $4.08. Gross margin for the full year should be approximately 59%. Regarding OpEx for the full year, we spent a bit lower than planned in Q3 in both tests and IA businesses. We expect the full year OpEx will be about $1 billion up about 3% from 2021 at the midpoint of our Q4 guidance. Recall, our operating model flexes OpEx with revenue, so growth is naturally trended down through the year. A couple of points looking ahead at 2023, first, gross margins. I will note that because of the additional spending on supply resiliency forecasted product mix, we expect Q1 gross margin will be similar to Q4\u2019s level. Second, tax rate, in 2023 is forecasted to be at 17%. We\u2019ll update our midterm operating model in our January call. Summing it all up, we\u2019re expecting higher revenue and profit in the second half of the year than prior update in July. Declines in our test portfolio were less than forecasted, offset by weaker IA business driven by FX, continued economic challenges in Europe and labor scarcity in the channel. For 2022, OpEx spending will increase year-over-year approximately 3% versus the 11% to 13% anticipated at the beginning of the year as revenue forecasts have declined from our view in January. In a challenging environment, regardless if the driver is economic downturn, regulatory changes, supply shortages, labor scarcity or whatever may come our way, we\u2019re confident we have a great team, strategy, operating model and experience to lead us through whatever lies ahead. We will continue to focus on our customers and the long-term opportunities in tests and industrial automation markets. With that, I\u2019ll turn things over to Andy.\nAndy Blanchard: Thanks, Sanjay. Andrew, we\u2019d now like to take some questions. And as a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line with Krish [Sankar], Cowen. Pardon me, Krish, please check your mute button.\nKrish Sankar: Hi. Can you hear me?\nMark Jagiela: Yes, we can.\nKrish Sankar: Yes. Hey thanks for that \u2013 thanks for taking my question. I had two of them. First one, Mark, I\u2019m just kind of curious, you\u2019ve seen \u2013 industrial automation flow, you\u2019ve seen mobile compute flow, and then I understand the demand drivers for ADAS and auto. Do you worry that auto and industrial tests is the next shoe to draw? Or do you think that it could be resilient into 2023?\nMark Jagiela: Yes. I think that industrial is probably something we\u2019re looking to soften a little bit in 2023 and automotive at the moment is just, there\u2019s no sign of that. It\u2019s very strong. We\u2019re at a year where the market size for automotive and semiconductors is all time peak. But the ADAS and EV content is on such a dramatic rise that it could very well be that next year has a flattening, but at the moment we don\u2019t see it softening, certainly not through Q1.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. And then the quick follow-up, I think you mentioned that the China impact was probably $75 million to $100 million headwind in 2023. I\u2019m kind of curious, you mentioned a lot of the exposure was through memory. What about the China OSATs? I thought you had pretty high exposure over there too, or is that part of this $70 million to $100 million headwind?\nMark Jagiela: Most of that headwind is memory. There\u2019s not really a lot of incremental restrictions that we have related to China OSAT, so that\u2019s not really a headwind for us.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of CJ Muse with Evercore ISI.\nCJ Muse: Yes, good afternoon or good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, was hoping to get a little bit more detail on gross margins. I think you talked about manufacturing, engineering, resiliency and kind of investments outside of China negatively impacting margins into Q1. And I guess, can you give a little bit more color on the plans there and how we should think about the impact to overall calendar 2023?\nSanjay Mehta: Sure. Hi, CJ, it\u2019s Sanjay. So addressing gross margins and I\u2019ll get to the resiliency plans. So think of Q4 as roughly a third, a third, a third volume decline product mix, and then resiliency spending of the bridge from Q3 to Q4. And a lot of that continues into Q1. Getting into the resiliency plans, for the past couple of years we\u2019ve been working to, on what I call a multi-country manufacturing approach. We\u2019ve obviously grown over the last several years and we had to increase capacity. So we fundamentally took the approach to have redundant capacity in both different geographies, and not just from manufacturing, but from a supply chain perspective. And from that we\u2019ve chosen to accelerate over the next couple of quarters. So what you\u2019re seeing is an accelerated spend on the manufacturing. And then from an engineering services perspective, again to create capacity in different locations that\u2019ll take a little bit longer into the second half of 2023.\nCJ Muse: Very helpful. As my follow up, you talked a bit about 2023 outlook and highlighted your top customer accelerating higher, but not getting back to prior peak. I guess, any color there in terms of kind of the diversification of the business and/or when you\u2019ll have clear visibility to what kind of the magnitude of the growth might look like?\nGreg Smith: Yes. As usual, with our largest customer, the visibility comes pretty late, April of next year. We do get signs as early as this time of the year, which is why we have the sort of commentary on it going back above 10% for them. But it\u2019s not going to go back to greater than 20%. We don\u2019t believe where we\u2019ve seen prior peaks, primarily because the 3 nanometer move in 2023 will be for a fraction of the phone models that that will be introduced. So that will expand as we go beyond 2023 and we would expect it to continue to grow, therefore, that business piece. Outside of that, we\u2019ve talked a bit in these calls about design wins in emerging vertically integrated non-traditional semiconductor companies. That should be another growth engine for us as we look into 2023. So I didn\u2019t call that out as a specific balloon, but that sits there as well on top.\nCJ Muse: Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS.\nTimothy Arcuri: Hi. Thanks. So I\u2019m wondering if Mark, maybe you can help bridge the gap between Q4 is better because things aren\u2019t as bad as you thought when you guided particularly on this Semi Test side, mostly sounds like because of supply, but then Q1 being worse. So to get Q1 down 10%, you have to assume a pretty significantly worse than normal Q1, which I assume would mostly come from Semi Test. So can you sort of help us bridge that gap? Thanks.\nMark Jagiela: Well, first of all, in industrial automation, our Q1 is always down from Q4, so that is a factor here. And it\u2019s reasonably significant. So that is one thing. But in the case of Semi Test, we do see some incremental weakening in industrial, which we spoke about. The China headwinds we talked about around memory will start to impact us in Q1 as well. So the combination of those two are kind of what leads us into that estimate for Q1.\nTimothy Arcuri: Got it. Okay. And then can you also talk about, I know that you \u2013 it\u2019s a bit early to kind of talk about what the outlook is for the full year next year. But can you talk about any sense of directionality for the SOC TAM? I assume that the memory TAM will be down clearly, you have front end WFE down 40% plus next year for memory. So I assume that the memory test TAM would be down. But front end foundry and logic WFE TAM is not down that much next year it\u2019s down probably 5%, maybe 10%. So do you have any sense in terms of where the SOC TAM could go next year, at least from a directional perspective? Thanks.\nGreg Smith: Well, it\u2019s interesting. So first on memory. Although you\u2019re right on the WFE estimates, a lot of what\u2019s going to happen in memory, especially DRAM next year, is the shift to DDR5 finally for server applications. That requires a brand new test platform. So we actually think that memory next year for a test will actually be pretty good. It may be, let\u2019s say, flattish with 2022 levels. It could, because on the NAND side it could come down a little bit, but we\u2019re pretty optimistic given what we\u2019re hearing from our customers because of the DDR5 transition. In SOC from a TAM point of view, I would expect the overall TAM to be a little bit weaker because the late in the year, declines in the PC markets, the compute markets, I think will precipitate into a lull in capacity adds early next year. And that will get offset, of course, by let\u2019s say, some mobility growth related to 3-nanometer. But maybe the falloff on the PC side \u2013 the impact of the falloff on the PC side might be more pronounced than the growth on the mobility side. And let\u2019s say, automotive remains relatively strong. Industrial weakens a bit. So I could see it being marginally down next year, the first half much more so. I think that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to see the sort of digestion around capacity for PC test and such come to fruition.\nTimothy Arcuri: Great, awesome. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Good morning, thanks for taking my question. For the first one, if I could start on gross margin, you gave us some color for 1Q. I was just thinking if you can give us a bit more color on the trajectory for the year, particularly the implications of the drivers of growth that you\u2019re outlining, which is \u2013 seems to have a lot of the growth will come from your primary customer next year and some from IA. But there\u2019s obviously demand slowdown across the board as well as the memory headwinds that you outlined. And there\u2019s also \u2013 I guess, supply improvement. So as we sort of look at the puts and takes, how should we think about the trajectory of gross margin given the growth drivers? And I have a follow-up.\nSanjay Mehta: Sure. So first, let me ground you \u2013 and as I\u2019ve said in my prepared remarks, this year, we plan to come in approximately 59% are on model. There\u2019s no change to our operating model that we\u2019re managing the business at 59% to 60%. I think I outlined in Q1 that we expect some headwinds tied to product mix as well as spending on resiliency accelerations. We\u2019re just going through the planning phase right now for 2023 and we\u2019ll be able to provide a little bit more color in the January call, but we fundamentally manage the business at 59% to 60% gross margins. And in any given quarter, those are going to oscillate tied to product mix and kind of what\u2019s happening in the environment.\nSamik Chatterjee: For my follow-up, I think I heard you say for the industrial automation slowdown that you\u2019re seeing, some level of that slowdown come through because of labor shortages. I\u2019m not sure if I heard you correctly there. But I\u2019m just curious if what you\u2019re hearing from your customers is more of a pullback in terms of capital investment plans that\u2019s driving the slowdown that you\u2019re seeing right now? Or is that sort of more of a next step right now, it\u2019s more about labor shortages that you sort of outlined? Thank you.\nSanjay Mehta: I pointed out there were sort of two factors involved. There is a slowdown in spend primarily in Europe due to economic conditions. And there, you do see some customers that are implementing capital freezes or limiting their investments. In other regions, the labor scarcity in the channel is the primary factor. What we see with our partners is that they actually are maintaining very high project backlogs and they\u2019re trying to work through those projects and add to their capacity at the same time, so that they\u2019re able to support a higher level of business. So we haven\u2019t seen a pullback in regions other than Europe, it\u2019s much more a constraint \u2013 a capacity constraint in our traditional distributor channel.\nSamik Chatterjee: Thank you for the clarification. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes, thanks for taking my question. The first one for Sanjay. In this scenario and I\u2019m not asking for a guide, in a scenario where your 2023 revenues would be flattish. Would you expect OpEx flat, up or down? And I have a follow-up.\nSanjay Mehta: Yes. Good question, Mehdi. We\u2019re \u2013 as I said earlier in the Q&A, we\u2019re currently preparing our plans for 2023, and we\u2019ll provide an update. But I will say, in January, we thought OpEx was going to grow of this year, 11% to 13%. Our operating model, obviously, with the macro environment and our projections coming down for the back half of 2022 and then for the full year, our operating model has a very little compensation declining OpEx and we also implemented spending controls. So what I can guide is that we\u2019re going to have a plan that\u2019s integrated and ties to revenue and a market view. And then if the environmental conditions change, we\u2019ll course correct as you\u2019ve seen us do this year.\nMehdi Hosseini: Okay. Let me come back to the question differently. You guys have been very proactive in helping us better help investors \u2013 you were the first one, nine, 12 months ago to talk about 3-nanometer pushed out and this morning, again, your recent expectation with 3-nanometer nine months ago, you were referring to significant strengthen capacity being added for MCUs analog. And now I\u2019m looking forward and some of those front-end equipment being added and may not be fully utilized. So why not take opportunity and be more conservative. Now I understand you\u2019re helping us by giving an overview of Q1 but why not just be more aggressive in being conservative?\nMark Jagiela: Well, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re being conservative or optimistic in terms of beyond Q1. We just don\u2019t have visibility. And so we could be speculative maybe. But it\u2019s just being a little bit prudent of what we know versus what we speculate. And I think the days of inventory in the semiconductor supply chain suggest as just digestion needed. And that should be something that\u2019s already starting and perhaps works its way through by next summer in many of these markets. But the bottom line is we don\u2019t know. And so we don\u2019t want to go out too far on our speculation.\nMehdi Hosseini: I\u2019m not asking for a speculating, but if I go back to nine months ago, [Technical Difficulty] we are thinking of, yes, considerable amount of front-end investments being added. But now we\u2019re finally looking at the inventory situation that is problematic. 25 really high and your customers have to come back on production. So even if they have added investment for front end, those equipment are not going to be fully utilized. So wouldn\u2019t none compute SOC be weak into midyear as your customers become more aggressive in working down inventories?\nMark Jagiela: Sure. It\u2019s very \u2013 it\u2019s likely that\u2019s the case. But on the other hand, there\u2019s offsets to that, that I mentioned. Our largest customer probably is going to be stronger. And so there\u2019s offsets to what is, let\u2019s say, likely to be digestion in some of those markets. But in our neck of the woods around mobility, 2022 was unprecedentedly weak because of the factors around product migration and complexity growth that worked against our neck of the woods. That\u2019s going to work in our favor a little bit next year to offset some of what you\u2019re referring to.\nMehdi Hosseini: Got it, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America.\nVivek Arya: Thank you for taking my question. First one on smartphone test. I\u2019m curious how much of the existing capacity that\u2019s for 5-nanometer can be repurposed for 3-nanometer tested? Is there a large reuse element that we should be aware of? And kind of related to that, I thought that one of the incremental growth areas for next year was the possibility that if your large customer would in-source their 5G modems, that would provide you incremental opportunity, but that seems to be pushed out as well. So just wanted to get your insights on the reuse aspect and the large customer retaining the 5G modem, what impact does that have on how you\u2019re thinking about next year?\nMark Jagiela: Yes. So first of all, testers reuse, yes, 100%. There\u2019s no obsolescence in the short-term on the SoC AP test side. This has been true for 10-plus years. The testers do not often obsolete themselves. We will come to that point at some point in the next four years or five years where that will begin to happen, but not in the short-term. On the drivers of test demand at our largest customer subject for a little bit. I\u2019m going to answer it a little bit broader than just the modem because I don\u2019t want to speculate or get into our customers\u2019 introduction plans on any specific device. But in general, when we look at 2022, now that we understand and it\u2019s public that, A, the new processor for phones that was introduced in 2022 only went to the high-end phone models and that new processor being the last processor built on 5-ish nanometer was only a 6% growth in transistor count. So very modest complexity growth, really muted the demand from that our largest customer this year. Drove them below 10%, and that\u2019s all kind of clear. Now if we look forward, the combination of what you described, the introduction of a new line of silicon when that happens will be a bump. And I\u2019m not going to say if it\u2019s when, but that\u2019s obviously in the pipe. Another bump is 3-nanometer for the apps processor for 2023 phones. If, in fact, that occurs, it\u2019s likely that it will be a pretty significant complexity bump, not 6%, but probably back in the 20% to 30% complexity growth that we\u2019ve seen historically with a new node. That gets muted a little bit though because it\u2019s likely it will still only go into the top end phone models. While this year\u2019s 6% incremental complex part waterfalls down to the other models. So the other models in 2023 aren\u2019t going to see much of a bump, but the high-end phone will. That\u2019s what kind of gives us this view that they could go back to being greater than 10, but less than historical peaks. Then let\u2019s look forward to 2024. We see another significant bump in complexity at the high end that phone app processor that was introduced in 2023 would likely waterfall down to the other models. And then the full product line in 2024 is likely to see a significant jump in complexity. So this is sort of how the movie plays out. And then on top of that, there\u2019s new silicon. There\u2019s also high-performance computing. All of that moving to 3-nanometer. But it\u2019s just going to be partially I think in 2023 and probably more fully in 2024. I\u2019m sorry if that\u2019s too long an answer.\nVivek Arya: No, no, very helpful. Thanks, Mark for that. My follow-up question is, it\u2019s interesting that you are keeping your calendar 2024 earnings model of $8, which is roughly a doubling from the 2022 level even though 2023 seems to be facing some of these macro headwinds. Mark, what\u2019s your gut on what is kind of the bottom of the cycle for you, right? Is it Q1, Q2 next year? Like when do you start making the recovery to your 2024 plan? Or is the 2024 plan looking ambitious at this point?\nMark Jagiela: Well, we\u2019ll update you on the 2024 plan in January. But what I just described gives you some understanding of why we think 2024 is probably a pretty strong year. In 2023, as usual, our quarters are lumpy. So our largest customer tends to tool in Q3 and Q4. So we would expect a bit of a bump there. But one thing we can\u2019t predict very well is the macroeconomic conditions that are going to occur. The digestion of inventory in the channel and those things, we have some ability to think about a model. But if the world is going to be in a recessionary environment or \u2013 and the effect of that on both semiconductors and IA is a little bit harder for us at this juncture to suss out. What I did say though is that 12 months is kind of a normal cycle here to go through. So that would suggest come third quarter next year, we should start to see a broader recovery, if it\u2019s like anything in the past.\nVivek Arya: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.\nJoe Moore: Great. Thank you. Why do you talk about memory test from the perspective of the DRAM and NAND vendors are building a lot of inventory right now. Is that untested and is that \u2013 like as their volume picks up, do you see a recovery in test volume that maybe helps you next year? And then on the flip side of that, I think you talked a little bit about what the deceleration in WFE might mean, but do you have any kind of sense of what memory supply does next year above and beyond the DDR5. Thank you.\nMark Jagiela: Yes. I think DDR5 is the only bright spot next year. The rest is kind of very tenuous. And I would expect the first half of next year, we\u2019re going to see other than DDR5 pretty weak demand as people are trying to balance fab capacity, inventory with end market demand. So I don\u2019t \u2013 earlier, I said maybe memory might \u2013 there\u2019s an argument that memory will hold up next year as a market for test because of the DDR5 transition, I think that\u2019s possible. I think it\u2019s more likely though we see that happen, but NAND fall off a bit stronger. And so a little bit more of a anchor on the market next year for memory than a balloon because of DDR5. And then we have the specific issue around China, where we\u2019ve been our overall market share in memory test is somewhere around 40%. But in China, it\u2019s been north of 50%. And this issue with one of our customers in China, which we may be prohibited from selling to is kind of going to be for Teradyne probably a net negative for memory test revenue in 2023.\nJoe Moore: Okay. But on those large inventory builds on the producer balance sheets, is that Die Bank that has yet to be tested? Or is there already some test that you think has occurred on that inventory?\nMark Jagiela: There is some test that\u2019s occurred, but a lot of it is in that sort of Die Bank area, keeping the fabs running as kind of something that makes economic sense. But finishing the product doesn\u2019t make sense until the demand materializes.\nJoe Moore: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] Goldman Sachs.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. Can you hear me okay?\nAndy Blanchard: Yes, we can.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Great. So I had one clarification and one question. In terms of my clarification, just on the China export control. You talked about the headwind in 2023 being $75 million to $100 million. Just curious how significant China memory test was in Q3? And I assume that number should be zero in Q4. Am I thinking about that correctly? And can you speak to the profitability of some of these China memory customers?\nMark Jagiela: Yes. Well, it\u2019s not zero in Q4 or next year. So that\u2019s maybe one comment. The profitability is not distinctively different than any \u2013 than our global margin. So there\u2019s no difference there. But there\u2019s a portion of the market in China will continue to serve. China overall, I think Sanjay mentioned is roughly 16% \u2013 15%, 16% of the company\u2019s revenue. Half of that is multinationals that really are not subject to any restrictions around this set of regulations. So about 8% of our annual sales, let\u2019s say, are two indigenous Chinese companies. And then roughly half of that might be memory. And then a fraction of that is this headwind of this one customer.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Mark, just a quick follow-up. So I meant local China memory. That should be near zero or zero going forward, correct? The multinationals you\u2019ll serve.\nMark Jagiela: Well, serve the multinationals, but there\u2019s a portion of the indigenous China memory market that we still can serve under the current regulation regime.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay. Okay. Got it. And then my question is on the IA side, maybe one for Greg. I realize it\u2019s hard to predict what 2023 could look like, but hoping to get your preliminary views there. You talked about labor scarcity outside of Europe being a 5 percentage point headwind. You talked a little bit about some of the idiosyncratic stuff that you\u2019re working on in terms of the new product, the higher payload, longer-reach product, you talked about the OEM channel. Could those be sort of impactful enough for your growth to accelerate in 2023? Or is it a little premature to talk about those things? Thank you.\nGreg Smith: So it is a little premature. We haven\u2019t fully worked out our complete plans, but I think you have hit some of the major factors that are going to go into that equation. So one thing is that the reason that we are talking about our results in constant currency is that we do expect a more stable FX environment in 2023. And that alone would add significantly to the growth that we saw in 2022 because that was like a 10-point headwind to where we are. Beyond that, we do expect significant impact from new products, both from UR and from MiR in 2023. And we also are going to continue to grow our complementary channels like OEM at similar rates to what we saw in 2022, but off of a larger base. So overall, they\u2019re going to have a greater impact on growth in 2023 than they had in 2022. So in other words, we are expecting these new things to help out with growth, we believe that our distribution partners are going to work on labor scarcity, but we are not counting on them to completely solve it in 2023.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Atif Malik with Citi.\nAtif Malik: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Mark, your comments on next year\u2019s end markets, they all make sense, memory stable on DDR5, industrial coming down, mobile improving on the large customer. The only one that I struggled is on the auto side, auto TAM around $700 million this year from historically $350 million. Now $100 million of that, like you said, is coming from new opportunities in ADAS, silicon carbide power management. What about the opportunities outside those areas like won\u2019t that see a correction next year if there\u2019s a recession?\nMark Jagiela: Yes. I think that\u2019s likely. You\u2019re right. I think some of the things that have contributed to getting the auto market up to the $700 million TAM level are a lot of these new technologies. But underneath that, there\u2019s a kind of core piece of legacy technologies that I would expect would soften as we get out of this sort of frenzy of trying to replenish the supply chain on those parts. So what I was saying is we don\u2019t see that coming in Q1. It\u2019s kind of not something we baked into Q1. But for 2023, that underlying, let\u2019s say, legacy piece of automotive technology is likely to come down.\nAtif Malik: Got it. And then, Sanjay, can you talk about what are the other geographies you\u2019re looking at in improving your supply chain resiliency moving out of China?\nSanjay Mehta: Sure. From a manufacturing standpoint, you should think about it from both manufacturing and supply chain, but think about other countries in Southeast Asia, Malaysia, Thailand, and then from an engineering services resiliency, think about Southeast Asia, but also think about other parts of the globe like in Europe.\nAtif Malik: Thank you.\nAndy Blanchard: And operator, we have time for just one more question, please.\nOperator: Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Barger with KeyBanc. Pardon me, Steve, please check your mute button. Pardon me, Steve, please check your mute button. Okay. I will now turn the call back over to Vice President of Investor Relations, Andy Blanchard for any closing remarks.\nAndy Blanchard: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today, and apologies for the technical pause along the way there. We look forward to talking to you in the days and weeks ahead. And certainly, if you have follow-up questions, reach out to me directly. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark Jagiela",
            "content": "Thanks, Andy. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us this morning. In today's call, Greg will review our 3Q results and 4Q outlook. I'll then describe the longer term view, and Sanjay will provide the financial details of the quarter. Greg? Thanks, Greg. I'll comment on the longer-term view of our markets and the impact of changes in the regulatory environment. Although better than estimated in our July call, the demand has slowed across our test markets as we enter Q4. As I noted at the time, predicting the depth and duration of these corrections is challenging, but in each of the last three corrections, growth has returned after 6 months to 12 months. We haven't seen anything in the last three months to change that view. So while it's too early to offer estimates on 2023 full year market size, based on the historical patterns and current market conditions, we expect next year's first quarter and first half demand to remain relatively weak. That, combined with the weak macro environment in industrial markets suggest that our Q1 revenue will likely be about 10% softer than Q4. Looking at the full year 2023, it's too early to make quantitative predictions but I'll point out how we're thinking about the balloons and anchors for the year ahead. First, the balloons. We expect the semiconductor industry to begin to transition to 3-nanometer technology and our largest customer to grow from less than 10% of company sales in 2022 to more than 10% next year. However, we expect them to be at a lower than historical past peak level as 3-nanometer will not hit full stride until 2024. In Industrial Automation, we also expect to grow year-over-year with the exact amount governed by macro conditions. Balancing these balloons are a few anchors. Semiconductor unit volumes and revenue are expected to decline in 2023 due to inventory digestion and macro headwinds. In Industrial Automation, slowing industrial growth worldwide and a pronounced slowdown in European manufacturing are additional anchors. So we're keeping a balanced view of next year, and we should have a better view of the full year in January. Looking longer-term, the case for growth in both Test and IA remains intact and compelling. In Semi Test, we're operating on a market growth trend line of 10% since 2017. Growth in our test businesses is driven by unit growth and complexity. We expect those drivers to remain in place as new semiconductor technologies such as 3-nanometer, gate all around and chiplets ramp over the next few years. These technology building blocks enable applications to continue to grow in complexity, including emerging applications like AI, ADAS and new compute architectures. In Industrial Automation, we remain bullish on the future. While we're not immune to macro conditions, we recognize the underlying drivers of demand are favorable for Cobot and AMR automation. Labor demographics and economics and the growing range of tasks our Cobots can perform ensures an expanding market opportunity, and our strategy enables us to capitalize on that opportunity for many years to come. Regarding the recent changes in trade regulations, indigenous Chinese memory makers have been a significant and growing part of our memory business. And while the new regulations mainly focus on fab equipment rather than test, tighter restrictions, combined with potential reduction in their wafer volume will likely impact our business. This situation is dynamic, but as of now, we see these regulations as about a $75 million to $100 million headwind going into 2023. On the supply side of the trade equation, we have a large manufacturing footprint in China, and our global support team has a professional services operation in place to support local and global customers. As part of our resiliency planning, we have been enabling additional global sites for these activities. Given the current environment, we will be accelerating the capacity growth of these other sites. Sanjay will take you through more details of those plans. Stepping back to look at the full year. Despite the drop in demand in the second half, we're on track to deliver our second highest revenue in history. We've balanced our growth investments with financial discipline and we positioned Teradyne for high growth as our core test and IA markets improve. Sanjay will now take you through the financial details. Sanjay? Yes, we can. Yes. I think that industrial is probably something we're looking to soften a little bit in 2023 and automotive at the moment is just, there's no sign of that. It's very strong. We're at a year where the market size for automotive and semiconductors is all time peak. But the ADAS and EV content is on such a dramatic rise that it could very well be that next year has a flattening, but at the moment we don't see it softening, certainly not through Q1. Most of that headwind is memory. There's not really a lot of incremental restrictions that we have related to China OSAT, so that's not really a headwind for us. Well, first of all, in industrial automation, our Q1 is always down from Q4, so that is a factor here. And it's reasonably significant. So that is one thing. But in the case of Semi Test, we do see some incremental weakening in industrial, which we spoke about. The China headwinds we talked about around memory will start to impact us in Q1 as well. So the combination of those two are kind of what leads us into that estimate for Q1. Well, I don't think we're being conservative or optimistic in terms of beyond Q1. We just don't have visibility. And so we could be speculative maybe. But it's just being a little bit prudent of what we know versus what we speculate. And I think the days of inventory in the semiconductor supply chain suggest as just digestion needed. And that should be something that's already starting and perhaps works its way through by next summer in many of these markets. But the bottom line is we don't know. And so we don't want to go out too far on our speculation. Sure. It's very \u2013 it's likely that's the case. But on the other hand, there's offsets to that, that I mentioned. Our largest customer probably is going to be stronger. And so there's offsets to what is, let's say, likely to be digestion in some of those markets. But in our neck of the woods around mobility, 2022 was unprecedentedly weak because of the factors around product migration and complexity growth that worked against our neck of the woods. That's going to work in our favor a little bit next year to offset some of what you're referring to. Yes. So first of all, testers reuse, yes, 100%. There's no obsolescence in the short-term on the SoC AP test side. This has been true for 10-plus years. The testers do not often obsolete themselves. We will come to that point at some point in the next four years or five years where that will begin to happen, but not in the short-term. On the drivers of test demand at our largest customer subject for a little bit. I'm going to answer it a little bit broader than just the modem because I don't want to speculate or get into our customers' introduction plans on any specific device. But in general, when we look at 2022, now that we understand and it's public that, A, the new processor for phones that was introduced in 2022 only went to the high-end phone models and that new processor being the last processor built on 5-ish nanometer was only a 6% growth in transistor count. So very modest complexity growth, really muted the demand from that our largest customer this year. Drove them below 10%, and that's all kind of clear. Now if we look forward, the combination of what you described, the introduction of a new line of silicon when that happens will be a bump. And I'm not going to say if it's when, but that's obviously in the pipe. Another bump is 3-nanometer for the apps processor for 2023 phones. If, in fact, that occurs, it's likely that it will be a pretty significant complexity bump, not 6%, but probably back in the 20% to 30% complexity growth that we've seen historically with a new node. That gets muted a little bit though because it's likely it will still only go into the top end phone models. While this year's 6% incremental complex part waterfalls down to the other models. So the other models in 2023 aren't going to see much of a bump, but the high-end phone will. That's what kind of gives us this view that they could go back to being greater than 10, but less than historical peaks. Then let's look forward to 2024. We see another significant bump in complexity at the high end that phone app processor that was introduced in 2023 would likely waterfall down to the other models. And then the full product line in 2024 is likely to see a significant jump in complexity. So this is sort of how the movie plays out. And then on top of that, there's new silicon. There's also high-performance computing. All of that moving to 3-nanometer. But it's just going to be partially I think in 2023 and probably more fully in 2024. I'm sorry if that's too long an answer. Well, we'll update you on the 2024 plan in January. But what I just described gives you some understanding of why we think 2024 is probably a pretty strong year. In 2023, as usual, our quarters are lumpy. So our largest customer tends to tool in Q3 and Q4. So we would expect a bit of a bump there. But one thing we can't predict very well is the macroeconomic conditions that are going to occur. The digestion of inventory in the channel and those things, we have some ability to think about a model. But if the world is going to be in a recessionary environment or \u2013 and the effect of that on both semiconductors and IA is a little bit harder for us at this juncture to suss out. What I did say though is that 12 months is kind of a normal cycle here to go through. So that would suggest come third quarter next year, we should start to see a broader recovery, if it's like anything in the past. Yes. I think DDR5 is the only bright spot next year. The rest is kind of very tenuous. And I would expect the first half of next year, we're going to see other than DDR5 pretty weak demand as people are trying to balance fab capacity, inventory with end market demand. So I don't \u2013 earlier, I said maybe memory might \u2013 there's an argument that memory will hold up next year as a market for test because of the DDR5 transition, I think that's possible. I think it's more likely though we see that happen, but NAND fall off a bit stronger. And so a little bit more of a anchor on the market next year for memory than a balloon because of DDR5. And then we have the specific issue around China, where we've been our overall market share in memory test is somewhere around 40%. But in China, it's been north of 50%. And this issue with one of our customers in China, which we may be prohibited from selling to is kind of going to be for Teradyne probably a net negative for memory test revenue in 2023. There is some test that's occurred, but a lot of it is in that sort of Die Bank area, keeping the fabs running as kind of something that makes economic sense. But finishing the product doesn't make sense until the demand materializes. Yes. Well, it's not zero in Q4 or next year. So that's maybe one comment. The profitability is not distinctively different than any \u2013 than our global margin. So there's no difference there. But there's a portion of the market in China will continue to serve. China overall, I think Sanjay mentioned is roughly 16% \u2013 15%, 16% of the company's revenue. Half of that is multinationals that really are not subject to any restrictions around this set of regulations. So about 8% of our annual sales, let's say, are two indigenous Chinese companies. And then roughly half of that might be memory. And then a fraction of that is this headwind of this one customer. Well, serve the multinationals, but there's a portion of the indigenous China memory market that we still can serve under the current regulation regime. Yes. I think that's likely. You're right. I think some of the things that have contributed to getting the auto market up to the $700 million TAM level are a lot of these new technologies. But underneath that, there's a kind of core piece of legacy technologies that I would expect would soften as we get out of this sort of frenzy of trying to replenish the supply chain on those parts. So what I was saying is we don't see that coming in Q1. It's kind of not something we baked into Q1. But for 2023, that underlying, let's say, legacy piece of automotive technology is likely to come down."

            "name": "Sanjay Mehta",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll provide details on our Q3 results, update you on the impact of the new trade regulations and describe our Q4 outlook. Now to Q3. Third quarter sales were $827 million, with non-GAAP EPS of $1.15. Non-GAAP gross margins were 58.7% and our non-GAAP operating expenses were $247 million. About flat with second quarter OpEx due to implemented spending controls. Non-GAAP operating profit was 28.8%. We had one, 10% customer in the quarter. The tax rate, excluding discrete items, for the quarter was 18.7% on a non-GAAP basis. Please note, you should now use 17.25% for the full year non-GAAP tax rate. Looking at the results from a business unit perspective. Semi Test revenue was $576 million with SOC revenue contributing $451 million and memory of $125 million. We cleared some supply constraints, which enabled the highest level of memory shipments in the past two years. In memory, the transitions to new memory standards in both flash and DRAM, along with strong demand from indigenous China customers drove the results. In SOC, the increasing semi content for EVs, autonomous driving and infotainment and autos, along with continued strength in analog industrial contributed to the demand. System Test group had revenue of $116 million with Storage Test delivering $70 million in Defense and aerospace and production board test $46 million. In Wireless Test at LitePoint, revenue was $46 million in the quarter, down 33% year-over-year, primarily because of lower WiFi revenue tied to declining PC and smartphone end markets. Now to Industrial Automation. IA revenue was $89 million with UR contributing $73 million and MiR $16 million. MiR results include auto guidance. As Greg noted, a large portion of IA sales are outside the U.S. For the first nine months, 41% of IA sales were in Europe, 29% in the U.S. and 11% in China and the remainder in the rest of the world. From a financial perspective in IA, the group was slightly above breakeven on a non-GAAP operating basis in the third quarter. And for the full year, we expect to be about breakeven. Below the 5% to 15% profit range planned for the group. As growth has slowed this year, we've also slowed the growth in OpEx. Shifting to supply. Looking at Q4, we continue to face supply issues, but the supply trend continues to improve relative to three months ago. These supply bottlenecks noted at the beginning of each quarter have moved from $50 million in Q3 to about $15 million in the fourth quarter. These amounts are outside the high end of our guidance range. Switching to a strategic issue. We manufacture certain products and deliver certain engineering services in China for our global customers. While recent U.S. government actions have no immediate impact to these operations, due to concerns about potential future impacts, we are accelerating our strategy to expand our manufacturing and engineering service capabilities in other countries. In manufacturing, this work has been underway for several years and we're accelerating the work to complete our expansion strategy in the next several quarters. In Engineering Services, the transition will likely take most of 2023 to achieve. Shifting to the balance sheet and cash flow. [Technical Difficulty] I'll go back to shifting to the balance sheet. Shifting to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our cash and marketable securities at the end of the quarter totaled approximately $900 million about flat with Q2. We had $233 million in free cash flow in the quarter and our DSO came down from 74 to 58 days. Uses of cash in the quarter included share buybacks of $217 million, dividend payments of $17 million and debt retirement of $10 million. Due to opportunistic buying through the year, we finished our $750 million share repurchase plan for 2022 full three months ahead of the original schedule. Our Board has authorized continued opportunistic share repurchases in Q4. Since our program began in 2015, we've repurchased 74 million shares at an average price of $45.85. Regarding debt, to date, $397 million of convertible bonds have early converted. Now to our revolver. During Q3, we worked with our banking partners and have increased the capacity of the revolver to $750 million from $400 million. Our credit facility is in place until December 2026. Now to our outlook for Q4. As Greg noted, our outlook is ahead of what we expected three months ago, driven mainly by Semi Test. Sales in Q4 are expected to be between $670 million and $750 million with non-GAAP EPS in a range of $0.62 to $0.86 on 164 million diluted shares. Fourth quarter guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles. Fourth quarter gross margins are estimated at 56% to 57% down from Q3 due to lower volume, product mix and spending on accelerated \u2013 on accelerating our manufacturing and service delivery resiliency. OpEx is expected to run at 34% to 38% of fourth quarter sales. On a non-GAAP operating \u2013 the non-GAAP operating profit rate at the midpoint of our fourth quarter guidance is 21%. Looking at the full year of 2022. At the midpoint of our guidance, 2022 revenue will be $3.1 billion with an EPS of $4.08. Gross margin for the full year should be approximately 59%. Regarding OpEx for the full year, we spent a bit lower than planned in Q3 in both tests and IA businesses. We expect the full year OpEx will be about $1 billion up about 3% from 2021 at the midpoint of our Q4 guidance. Recall, our operating model flexes OpEx with revenue, so growth is naturally trended down through the year. A couple of points looking ahead at 2023, first, gross margins. I will note that because of the additional spending on supply resiliency forecasted product mix, we expect Q1 gross margin will be similar to Q4's level. Second, tax rate, in 2023 is forecasted to be at 17%. We'll update our midterm operating model in our January call. Summing it all up, we're expecting higher revenue and profit in the second half of the year than prior update in July. Declines in our test portfolio were less than forecasted, offset by weaker IA business driven by FX, continued economic challenges in Europe and labor scarcity in the channel. For 2022, OpEx spending will increase year-over-year approximately 3% versus the 11% to 13% anticipated at the beginning of the year as revenue forecasts have declined from our view in January. In a challenging environment, regardless if the driver is economic downturn, regulatory changes, supply shortages, labor scarcity or whatever may come our way, we're confident we have a great team, strategy, operating model and experience to lead us through whatever lies ahead. We will continue to focus on our customers and the long-term opportunities in tests and industrial automation markets. With that, I'll turn things over to Andy. Sure. Hi, CJ, it's Sanjay. So addressing gross margins and I'll get to the resiliency plans. So think of Q4 as roughly a third, a third, a third volume decline product mix, and then resiliency spending of the bridge from Q3 to Q4. And a lot of that continues into Q1. Getting into the resiliency plans, for the past couple of years we've been working to, on what I call a multi-country manufacturing approach. We've obviously grown over the last several years and we had to increase capacity. So we fundamentally took the approach to have redundant capacity in both different geographies, and not just from manufacturing, but from a supply chain perspective. And from that we've chosen to accelerate over the next couple of quarters. So what you're seeing is an accelerated spend on the manufacturing. And then from an engineering services perspective, again to create capacity in different locations that'll take a little bit longer into the second half of 2023. Sure. So first, let me ground you \u2013 and as I've said in my prepared remarks, this year, we plan to come in approximately 59% are on model. There's no change to our operating model that we're managing the business at 59% to 60%. I think I outlined in Q1 that we expect some headwinds tied to product mix as well as spending on resiliency accelerations. We're just going through the planning phase right now for 2023 and we'll be able to provide a little bit more color in the January call, but we fundamentally manage the business at 59% to 60% gross margins. And in any given quarter, those are going to oscillate tied to product mix and kind of what's happening in the environment. I pointed out there were sort of two factors involved. There is a slowdown in spend primarily in Europe due to economic conditions. And there, you do see some customers that are implementing capital freezes or limiting their investments. In other regions, the labor scarcity in the channel is the primary factor. What we see with our partners is that they actually are maintaining very high project backlogs and they're trying to work through those projects and add to their capacity at the same time, so that they're able to support a higher level of business. So we haven't seen a pullback in regions other than Europe, it's much more a constraint \u2013 a capacity constraint in our traditional distributor channel. Yes. Good question, Mehdi. We're \u2013 as I said earlier in the Q&A, we're currently preparing our plans for 2023, and we'll provide an update. But I will say, in January, we thought OpEx was going to grow of this year, 11% to 13%. Our operating model, obviously, with the macro environment and our projections coming down for the back half of 2022 and then for the full year, our operating model has a very little compensation declining OpEx and we also implemented spending controls. So what I can guide is that we're going to have a plan that's integrated and ties to revenue and a market view. And then if the environmental conditions change, we'll course correct as you've seen us do this year. Sure. From a manufacturing standpoint, you should think about it from both manufacturing and supply chain, but think about other countries in Southeast Asia, Malaysia, Thailand, and then from an engineering services resiliency, think about Southeast Asia, but also think about other parts of the globe like in Europe."

            "name": "Greg Smith",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Teradyne's third quarter sales and profits were above the midpoint of our guidance in revenue and profit with sales of $827 million and $1.15 in non-GAAP earnings per share. At the company level, the quarter unfolded generally as planned, but at the operating level, we cleared some supply bottlenecks, which allowed us to ship more semiconductor test products than planned in the quarter. On the other hand, industrial automation was weaker than we forecast in July. Putting the third quarter into context. When we spoke in July, we noted that slowing SOC and wireless tester demand in the second half were related to declines in the end market shipments of smartphones, compute products and associated infrastructure. With that backdrop, we reduced our estimate for the SOC market size and reduced our second half shipment plan approximately $300 million. About one-third of that amount was already confirmed in June and about two-thirds, $200 million was our judgment on how the second half would unfold. In the subsequent three months, about $110 million of the $200 million additional decline was realized and about $90 million was not as overall test demand held up better than we expected in July. This incremental strength and test has been partially offset by weaker IA demand as reflected in the Q4 guidance. The highlight in Semi Test is the continued strength in automotive test demand. This year, we're seeing a step increase in our shipments for ADAS processors, silicon carbide drive and charging ICs and battery management devices. Our UltraFLEX platform is well aligned to the unique requirements of multibillion transistor ADAS processors and our Eagle platform is well suited for the thousands of volts and hundreds of amps often required for silicon carbide devices. It's notable that these three device types collectively will add over $100 million of incremental SOC TAM in 2022 and they were insignificant five years ago. Shifting now to industrial automation. Because only about 30% of our sales are transacted in dollars and there have been significant changes in exchange rates in 2022, will describe results in both constant currency and dollar terms. In constant currency, Automation Group Q3 revenue grew 7% from last year's Q3 and is up 19% for the first nine months of the year. In dollar terms, however, revenue contracted 2% in the quarter compared with Q3 2021 and growth is 11% for the first nine months. Looking at the full year, we expect IA growth from 2021 will be about 6% in dollar terms at the midpoint of our Q4 guidance. In constant currency terms, IA growth will come in at about 14%. Even using constant currency terms, this is below our 2022 plan to grow in the mid-30s, from the 2021 level and reflects two additional factors. First, slowing industrial activity, especially in Europe, where PMIs dropped below 50 in July and have remained in that contraction zone since. Europe is our largest end market for automation and this is a 10-point headwind to growth. Second, labor scarcity continues in our distribution channel, which we expect to reduce growth by about five points. While 2022 growth is below our plan, we have a number of bright spots in IA, and I will highlight just a few. At Universal Robots, customer demand for our higher payload, longer-reach UR20 has been stronger than expected since its introduction mid-year, and we expect it to be a meaningful contributor to results when it begins shipping in 2023. The UR20 expands our capability in the palletizing, welding and machine tending end markets. Also, we've continued to grow our OEM channel at UR including supporting partner expansion from national to international sales coverage. The OEM channel is a powerful growth driver for us. For example, our welding channel grew over 80% in the first nine months compared with last year. And for this year, we expect to ship well over 1,200 robots in that vertical. At MiR, our sales to large customers continue to expand with more than 30 customers having fleet sizes greater than 20 robots. The number of customers with these large fleets has increased 30% in 2022. This is significant as our fleet management software is an increasingly important differentiator as fleet sizes grow. On a related note, at the end of Q3 we merged AutoGuide into MiR as we prepare to offer customers a broad payload range from hundreds to thousands of kilograms sold by the same team using the same fleet management software backed by the same global distribution \u2013 same global network of distributors, all while increasing our engineering, marketing and back-office leverage. Finally, MiR service and spares revenue has more than doubled to about 5% of revenue through the first nine months compared with 2021 as we begin to expand our customer support offering. Across Industrial Automation, the investments we're continuing to make are giving us the foundation to support high growth with differentiated products to global customers through multiple distribution channels. While we are not satisfied with 2022's growth rate and have taken actions to improve, we remain confident of our long-term strategy in these growing markets. With that, I'll now pass it back to Mark. Yes. As usual, with our largest customer, the visibility comes pretty late, April of next year. We do get signs as early as this time of the year, which is why we have the sort of commentary on it going back above 10% for them. But it's not going to go back to greater than 20%. We don't believe where we've seen prior peaks, primarily because the 3 nanometer move in 2023 will be for a fraction of the phone models that that will be introduced. So that will expand as we go beyond 2023 and we would expect it to continue to grow, therefore, that business piece. Outside of that, we've talked a bit in these calls about design wins in emerging vertically integrated non-traditional semiconductor companies. That should be another growth engine for us as we look into 2023. So I didn't call that out as a specific balloon, but that sits there as well on top. Well, it's interesting. So first on memory. Although you're right on the WFE estimates, a lot of what's going to happen in memory, especially DRAM next year, is the shift to DDR5 finally for server applications. That requires a brand new test platform. So we actually think that memory next year for a test will actually be pretty good. It may be, let's say, flattish with 2022 levels. It could, because on the NAND side it could come down a little bit, but we're pretty optimistic given what we're hearing from our customers because of the DDR5 transition. In SOC from a TAM point of view, I would expect the overall TAM to be a little bit weaker because the late in the year, declines in the PC markets, the compute markets, I think will precipitate into a lull in capacity adds early next year. And that will get offset, of course, by let's say, some mobility growth related to 3-nanometer. But maybe the falloff on the PC side \u2013 the impact of the falloff on the PC side might be more pronounced than the growth on the mobility side. And let's say, automotive remains relatively strong. Industrial weakens a bit. So I could see it being marginally down next year, the first half much more so. I think that's where we're going to see the sort of digestion around capacity for PC test and such come to fruition. So it is a little premature. We haven't fully worked out our complete plans, but I think you have hit some of the major factors that are going to go into that equation. So one thing is that the reason that we are talking about our results in constant currency is that we do expect a more stable FX environment in 2023. And that alone would add significantly to the growth that we saw in 2022 because that was like a 10-point headwind to where we are. Beyond that, we do expect significant impact from new products, both from UR and from MiR in 2023. And we also are going to continue to grow our complementary channels like OEM at similar rates to what we saw in 2022, but off of a larger base. So overall, they're going to have a greater impact on growth in 2023 than they had in 2022. So in other words, we are expecting these new things to help out with growth, we believe that our distribution partners are going to work on labor scarcity, but we are not counting on them to completely solve it in 2023."

After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to Andy Blanchard. Please go ahead.\nAndy Blanchard: Thank you, Latif. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our discussion of Teradyne\u2019s most recent financial results. I\u2019m joined this morning by our CEO, Mark Jagiela; President, Greg Smith; and our CFO, Sanjay Mehta. Following our opening remarks, we\u2019ll provide details of our performance for 2022\u2019s second quarter, along with our outlook for the third quarter of 2022. Press release containing our second quarter results was issued last evening. We\u2019re providing slides on the Investor page of the website that may be helpful to you in following the discussion. Replays of this call will be available via the same page after the call ends. The matters that we discuss today will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause Teradyne\u2019s results to differ materially from management\u2019s current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release, as well as our most recent SEC filings. Additionally, those forward-looking statements are made as of today, and we take no obligation to update them as a result of developments occurring after this call. During today\u2019s call, we\u2019ll make reference to non-GAAP financial measures. We\u2019ve posted additional information concerning these non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure were available on the Investor page of the website. Looking ahead, between now and our next earnings call, Teradyne expects to participate in technology or industrial-focused investor conferences hosted by KeyBanc, Davidson, Jefferies, Deutsche Bank, Citi, Evercore, Piper Sandler and Goldman Sachs. Now let's get on with the rest of the agenda. First, Mark and Greg will comment on our recent results and the market conditions as we enter the new quarter. Sanjay will then offer more details on our quarterly results along with our guidance for the third quarter. We'll then answer your questions, and this call is scheduled for one hour. Mark?\nMark Jagiela: Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Greg will summarize our Q2 results, and I'll comment on the full year outlook and technology drivers we expect in 2023. Sanjay will then take you through the financial details, including our outlook for the third quarter. Greg?\nGreg Smith: Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Teradyne's second quarter sales and profits were above the midpoint of our guidance in revenue and profit with sales of $841 million and $1.21 in non-GAAP earnings per share. From a market perspective, we're seeing mixed signals. While the pressure to improve lead times in some test markets is as strong as ever, and we continue to work through supply issues, we have seen some softening in mobility demand, our largest test market. Also, it now looks like IA growth in the second half will be similar to first half growth. In today's call, we'll try to provide some context on how we're navigating this complex environment. Diving into the details of the second quarter, semiconductor test revenues were in line with our plan as were profits. The automotive and industrial end markets served by our Eagle platform were notably strong in the quarter. In memory, flash final test and DRAM wafer sort was the strongest markets. From a strategic perspective, Semi Test had a strong quarter of competitive design wins for both R&D applications and for devices that we expect to ramp in volume production over the next year or so. The design wins were in a wide range of end markets. There were Ultra Flex family design wins in mobility, where the systems architecture supports higher throughput for large complex devices especially when time to market is an important factor. Eagle Test had a significant design win in a battery management application where the system's highly accurate voltage measurement capability enables customers to get to market faster with better device specifications, delivering higher value. In Systems test, sales were on plan in the quarter with solid year-on-year growth for storage test and production board test. At LitePoint, strong wireless test demand for Wi-Fi 6C, Wi-Fi 7 R&D and ultra wideband test products drove double-digit year-on-year growth. Notably, we're seeing strong interest in Wi-Fi 7 development test where we are qualified at all major chipset vendors and to date, we have won 20 of 21 design-in opportunities with end product design teams. This sets us up to expand our already high share of Wi-Fi production test as these products ramp. In Industrial Automation, revenues grew 10% from last year's Q2 and 19% for the first half. This lower than planned growth in the first half is attributed to two primary factors and warrants a few comments. The first factor was foreign exchange. The majority of IA revenue is linked to the euro. For example, within Europe, at UR, we saw a robust 34% unit growth in the first half of 2022 but the decline of the euro with respect to the dollar has muted UR revenue growth in that region to 20%. The dollars appreciation was a revenue headwind in the first half and Sanjay will comment further on the full year foreign exchange outlook. The second factor is lower regional demand that can be traced to a variety of region-specific causes, including COVID lockdowns in China and distribution partner staff shortages in North America where end demand remains quite strong. Staff shortages for integration partners is an ongoing challenge. In the past, we've noted that our distribution partners struggle to grow staff at the same rate as IA demand growth. Our strategy to overcome this is to use software technology and plug-and-play applications from UR+ and MiRGo partners to shorten the deployment time to make these critical staff more productive. But an equally important part of the strategy is to build a robust OEM channel. For example, at Universal Robots, our OEM channel, which includes verticals like welding, power grid maintenance and order fulfillment is doing very well, growing 39% in the first half of 2022. The OEM channel is an important complement to our distributor-based channel because these OEM partners deliver a mostly complete solution to their customers that can be put in operation almost immediately. In many cases, these OEMs have an existing distribution network that can reach customers beyond our traditional channel. These partners can scale much more efficiently than distributors that add staff in proportion to revenue growth for customer support. We are actively adding new OEM partners to serve these and new market verticals. Now I'll hand it back to Mark more on the market, the second half outlook and the demand drivers for next year.\nMark Jagiela: Thanks, Greg. While the long-term drivers in our test and automation markets remain firmly in place, the recent deceleration we're experiencing in test will impact our full year results. Over the past few weeks, we've seen a marked slowdown in SOC and wireless tester demand in the second half related to declines in end market shipments of smartphones, compute products and associated infrastructure. These demand adjustments are -- these demand adjustments are happening in real time, and we are projecting this will continue over the next several weeks as the market continues to align their production plans and inventory levels to this new reality. This extends across multiple customers and device types, including apps processors, power management and RF. I will note that auto MCU, industrial and memory test demand remains strong entering Q3 and we've seen no deceleration of demand in these markets. When forecasting the second half of 2022, we are expecting the test realignments we've seen in the past few weeks are not a blip and that further adjustments are coming. Beyond the reductions we've already seen, several customers have indicated they are in a capital review phase, which we are assuming will lead to some additional impact to Q4 demand. At a macro level, we also assume that China's smartphone volumes will not accelerate through the remainder of the year. We also believe that short-term global economic conditions will remain weak, resulting in softening consumer demand and associated electronics inventory digestion. In IA, we forecast that our second half business will continue to grow at about a 20% year-over-year level, consistent with our achievements in the first half, but below our 35% goal. As Greg highlighted, we believe that China demand will remain muted. Distributor labor shortages in North America will limit the rate of installation expansion in the short-term and FX headwinds will not abate. Summing it all up, we now expect our second half revenue to be slightly lower than the first half, resulting in a roughly 52%, 48% first half, second half split. Our latest forecast projects that 2022 SOC test market will be in the range of $4.2 billion to $4.6 billion, down from our April estimate of about $5 billion, while in memory, we expect the market will remain at about $1 billion. To reiterate, much of our forecasted slowdown assumes continued yet to be identified demand decline in the fourth quarter. Looking further ahead, after six consecutive years of robust SOC test market growth, we have entered a period of demand slowdown in digestion. This is not uncommon as we've seen this most recently in 2013 and 2015. And over the years, we've built our operating model to anticipate this kind of demand swings. Predicting the depth and duration of these corrections is challenging, but in each of the last three corrections, growth returned after six to 12 months with the subsequent year showing strong growth. The ramp of 3-nanometer starting in 2023, followed by gate all around and increasing multi-chip packaging remains unaltered drivers of growth ahead. Interface transitions in both Flash and DRAM are also imminent. Hyperscalers continue to expand their chip design starts and AJI [ph] as a new class of silicon application gaining momentum. In Industrial Automation, the value proposition has only strengthened as the short ROI remains compelling, while increased resiliency in a world of questionable labor supply as another motivation to automate. So while the first half of 2022 unfolded roughly as outlined in January, the second half is looking considerably softer as we than we expected just three months ago. However, we are confident of our long-term growth strategy and are focused on execution of our design-ins and R&D programs so that we are positioned to capitalize on growth of these markets that we serve. Sanjay will now take you through the financial details. Sanjay?\nSanjay Mehta: Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll provide details on our Q2 results, offer additional color on how we're addressing the slowdown in some markets and supply shortages and others and describe our Q3 outlook. Now to Q2. Second quarter sales were $841 million with non-GAAP EPS of $1.21, non-GAAP gross margins were 60.2% and our non-GAAP operating expenses were $251 million, $14 million below mid guidance. The main driver -- sorry -- the main driver of the lower than planned OpEx was an Industrial Automation Group or IAG due to lower variable compensation tied to lower revenue projections and slower than planned hiring. Non-GAAP operating profit rate was 30.3% we had two 10% customers in the quarter. The tax rate, excluding discrete items for the quarter was 16.9% on a non-GAAP basis. Please note, you should now use 16.5% for the full year non-GAAP tax rate. Looking at the results from a business unit perspective. Semi Test revenue was $541 million. SOC revenue was $461 million, driven by strength in automotive and industrial markets. Memory revenue was $81 million, led by flash final test and DRAM wafer sort. System Test group had revenue of $135 million, which was up 29% year-over-year. Storage Test sales, including both HDD and system-level test solutions were $86 million in the quarter, up 49% from Q2 2021. Defense and aerospace and production board test combined grew 4% year-on-year. At LitePoint, revenue of $64 million was up 16% from prior year due primarily to strong shipments in Wi-Fi 6C and Wi-Fi 7 and UWB test systems. Now to Industrial Automation. Industrial Automation revenue of $101 million in Q2 was up 10% year-over-year. This was lower than expected, as Greg noted. Despite the lower growth, we still expect IA revenue to follow the historical pattern and grow as we move through the year. UR sales were $83 million in Q2, up 8% year-over-year with the highest growth in Northern Europe. MiR sales were $17 million, up 9% from Q2 2021 in the quarter. From a financial perspective, in IA the group was slightly under breakeven on a non-GAAP operating basis in the second quarter. And for the full year, we expect to be towards the low end of the 5% to 15% profit range we discussed in past calls. We view the roughly 20% growth rate in IA as a short-term situation, as Greg noted. Like the company model, the IAG Group operating model naturally flex spending down based on profitability, and we're tightening discretionary spending where appropriate. But our long-term IA growth strategy and related investment plans remain unchanged. Shifting to supply. Our Q2 guidance excluded approximately $50 million of revenue tied to our inability to supply customer demand. In Q3, we're excluding a similar $50 million of revenue from our guidance range, primarily in our test businesses. The shortage of semiconductors ranging from FPGAs to industrial analog continues to impact our production. As I've noted in prior calls, we're taking numerous actions to harden our supply chain but even with these actions, we expect supply line constraints to remain challenging. I will note these actions and other factors improved our supply situation in Q2, mainly in test, which enabled higher shipments. Shifting to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our cash and marketable securities at the end of the quarter totaled approximately $900 million, down from $1.2 billion at the end of Q1. We had $70 million in free cash flow in the quarter, reflecting the timing of shipments and supplier prepayments. Over 80% of our shipments occurred in May and June saw our DSO expanded to 74 days, which we expect will decline in the second half of the year. Other uses of cash in the quarter included share buybacks of $331 million, dividend payments of $18 million and debt retirement of $22 million. At the end of Q2, we're more than two-thirds of the way through our $750 million share repurchase plan for 2022 with $217 million remaining. In October -- sorry, in our October call, we'll note any updates to our share buyback plan. Regarding debt. To date, $386 million of convertible bonds have early converted. I'd also like to note several points regarding the strong US dollar and its impact on our results. In our Test portfolio, the majority of revenue and expense are in dollars, so there's not a material foreign exchange impact. In IA businesses, on the other hand, have a large amount of euro-linked expenses and about 50% of their revenue is tied to the euro. The result as the strong dollar reduces IA's revenue and gross margin in dollars. In the first half, the FX impact reduced our IA growth rate approximately four points. Assuming exchange rates remain consistent with July's exchange rate, we expect six points of growth headwind for the full year compared to our January projection. For IA, the strengthening dollar has a marginal benefit on the OpEx side. IA revenue and margin degradation is offset by the OpEx gain, yielding a neutral effect on our operating profit for that segment. Now to our outlook for Q3. A combination of slowing demand and test, extending lead times due to material shortages and reduced automation demand in Europe and China results in a lower Q3 outlook than we expected three months ago. As noted, the guidance excludes approximately $50 million of shipments due to material shortages primarily in test. Also, the guidance assumes we won't see any extended shutdowns of production facilities due to COVID, and we won't see any new trade restrictions. With that said, sales in Q3 are expected to be between $760 million and $840 million, with non-GAAP EPS in a range of $0.90 to $1.16 on 166 million diluted shares. The third quarter guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles. Third quarter gross margins are estimated at 58% to 59%, down from Q2 due to product mix, 2022 investment supply chain resiliency and wage inflation. Some of these effects are transitory, and we expect our mid-term earnings model gross margin range of 59% to 60% to remain intact. OpEx is expected to run at 31% to 34% of third quarter sales. The non-GAAP operating profit rate at the midpoint of our third quarter guidance is 26%. As Mark noted, we expect second half revenue to be below the first half, approximately 48% of full year sales. Given the reduced revenue outlook for the second half of the year, our operating expenses are now planned to grow just 4% to 6% annually versus 11% to 13% planned in our prior guidance. The OpEx reduction from prior guide is driven by two factors. First, our variable compensation model is approximately half of the decline tied to reduced revenue. Second, we have delayed some expenditures in both test and IA, which we believe will not impact our long-run competitiveness. Spending savings are roughly evenly split between engineering and go-to-market. Summing it all up, we're expecting revenue and profit in Q3 and the second half of the year to be lower than we projected three months ago, but our operating model is resilient to varying revenue levels. With the reduced revenue level, our model reduces variable compensation expense, and we're taking other steps as appropriate. A downturn is always challenging, but we're confident we have the operating model, strategy and experience to lead us through whatever lies ahead, while keeping our focus on the needs of our customers and the long-term opportunities in the test and industrial automation markets. With that, I'll turn things over to Andy.\nAndy Blanchard: Thanks, Sanjay. Latif, we\u2019d now like to take some questions. And as a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya of Bank of America. Vivek Arya, please go ahead.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to clarify that you're guiding Q4 roughly around $670 million, $675 million, which seems to be kind of pre-COVID levels. And I think if I take your IA guidance into account, it suggest that non-IA Q4 sales will be $430 million, which would be, I think, almost 20% below pre-COVID levels. Did I get that right? And I realize that there are headwinds, but why is such a sharp decline in your Q4 outlook?\nMark Jagiela: Yeah. Roughly speaking, those are about right. And I think, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, maybe we probably reduced our second half revenue targets somewhere between $300 million to $350 million. About one-third of that is known customer weakening where the demand has been communicated to us to have soften. Two-thirds of it is just a projection of more to come of that vein based on conversations that are just beginning with customers. So there's not a clear -- and all of this is mostly related to test. So there's not sort of a clear identified two-thirds of that decline portion, but it's just the experience we've seen in prior cycles and the test industry suggest that there's more to come. If you go back to 2013, for example, when the market went through a significant 30% year-over-year correction, this was the beginning of that kind of trend. Now here, we're talking about a market correcting about 9% off of the peak of last year. So a much more modest correction -- but that's -- this is kind of how the market turns and we're using history to guide us in how we're projecting these yet to be identified digestion phases.\nVivek Arya: Got it. And then, Mark, I'm curious, what is your exposure to Android smartphones this year versus last year? And how much of a headwind -- is that continuous? And do you think that will alleviate next year, or can that still be an offset to any 3-nanometer testing benefits on the iOS side? So just the interplay between Android and iOS this year and what you're thinking about from a next year perspective? Thank you.\nMark Jagiela: Yeah. I think our exposure to Android smartphones is a little bit higher this year than it's been in past years. We've picked up a little bit of market share in that segment. Obviously, that segment is down significantly this year in unit volume. So that's having the -- that's principally the reason for the declines we're forecasting here in the second half. Now when we look at 2023, it's hard to tell what's going to happen with the Android phones, part of what's happened in 2022 in terms of the declines related to China -- and part of this is predicting how China will rebound in 2023 as consumer demand hopefully recovers. But we don't have a strong forecast for the Android sub-segment of smartphones yet for 2023. So I can't really give you a lot of color on that.\nVivek Arya: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs. Toshiya Hari, your line is open.\nToshiya Hari: Hi, good morning. Thanks so much for taking the question. I had two as well, one on Semi Test and the other on IA. On the Semi Test side, Mark, I was hoping you could speak to your expectations in terms of market share for the year. Given the incremental weakness you're seeing at the market level and given that you had derisked your opportunity for this year with your largest customer. I feel like your market share position as of today is perhaps a little bit better than what you were thinking three months ago. I just wanted to clarify that on the Semi Test side?\nMark Jagiela: Yeah. I think -- so there's two pieces of Semi Test Memory and SOC Memory, it's going to be 40-ish percent market share, consistent with last year. On SOC, it really depends on what happens on the compute side in terms of how much decline happens in the market on compute, which is more of our competitors, strong soup. So we've baked in a significant decline in mobility. We believe a decline in compute is imminent -- but that's something that I think over the next few weeks, as we hear from our competitor, we'll know more about. All that being said, I think our statistical share is in the upper -- mid- to upper 30% range in SOC Test this year. But that's based on, again, strong compute market, weak mobility market versus customer switching suppliers and that moves around quite a bit year-to-year.\nToshiya Hari: Got it. That's helpful. And then as my follow-up on the IA side, I guess a two-part question. The first part is I just wanted to clarify that fundamentals in the business remain pretty strong. And I asked the question because the reasons you noted for, I guess, the reduced outlook for the second half seemed technical transitory. You talked about FX. You talked about COVID lockdowns in China and staff shortages in the US. So fundamentally, is the business still healthy and intact? I guess that's number one. And then number two, on the OEM channel dynamic, just curious, how big is that channel today as a percentage of IA? And where do you see that going in a couple of years? And how does that impact profitability as OEM grows vis-\u00e0-vis your district [ph] business? Thank you.\nGreg Smith: Hi, this is Greg. Let me try and take that. So we believe that the fundamentals are still very strong in the IA market. The effects of China lockdowns and staff shortages should both eased to some extent through the rest of the year. We believe that the FX headwind is going to be consistent through the rest of this year. We don't see a significant appreciation of the euro. So that translation into dollars is going to continue to take a couple of points off the top in terms of our growth for revenue that's denominated in euros. To your second question, our OEM channel right now, it represents about 16% of overall UR revenue lower for the entirety of the Industrial Automation Group. And it's growing -- for the first half, it grew at 39% and we expect to be able to maintain that kind of a growth rate.\nToshiya Hari: And impact on profitability?\nGreg Smith: So our pricing in the OEM channel is a little bit favorable to pricing through our normal distribution channel. So we don't expect to see any negative impact to profitability as that channel grows.\nToshiya Hari: Great. Thanks for the details.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nSamik Chatterjee: Thanks for taking my questions. I have a couple as well. I think within Semi Test, you mentioned you're continuing to see robust demand in autos and industrial within Semi Test. So I was just wondering, given the trends you're seeing in industrial automation, are you baking in any incremental weakness as you go through the remainder of the year in autos and industrial as well within Semi Test? And then I have a follow-up.\nMark Jagiela: No, not really. Most of the weakness we're baking in, again, in the fourth quarter that we've yet to really get confirmation on is in more in mobility and compute and infrastructure. But we think industrial and auto will remain strong through the end of the year.\nSamik Chatterjee: And just a follow-up on the cost structure here. I see -- I mean, you've obviously pair back some of your expenses that were planned for this year. But in relation to SG&A, you're running pretty much at the same rate that you were last year when revenues were much higher as you start to think about the strategic CapEx if you buy some of your customers and maybe some delays to the secular long-term drivers that you have. What's the flexibility in terms of taking the cost structure lower or rightsizing it for maybe some of the pushouts in terms of revenue that you're seeing greater -- could you just postponing spend as you're doing announcing today? Thank you.\nSanjay Mehta: It's Sanjay. So just a couple of comments on our business model as it relates to cost structure. So as you know, the majority of our test portfolio has contract manufacturing. So it really provides great scalability up and down with our outsourced partners fixed assets. So that helps on the margin line. But then from an operating expense perspective, we have a key portion of our wages in a flexible or variable compensation plan that is that as revenue and profit goes up, that is passed along part of it to the employees. But as it goes down, which is one of -- it's about half of the driver of the growth reduction from a midpoint of 12% expected this year to a midpoint of 5%, as I noted in my prepared remarks, about half of that growth reduction is driven by the variable compensation. So we believe as time moves on and let's say, the market goes lower, we'll have the ability to reduce our operating expenses on a variable basis while keeping our workforce intact and investing for the long-term. And, obviously, as the market rebounds or increases, our revenue goes up, then that will increase our operating expenses on a variable basis.\nSamik Chatterjee: Thank you. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nC.J. Muse: Yeah, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question on gross margins. If I look at what you've kind of discussed in terms of mix, that's actually a positive on the SOC side, yet you're guiding gross margins, I think the worst is mid-2020 at a revenue run rate, I think that exceeded back then. So curious what is driving the gross margin hit here? Is it a much worse mix in SOC than what perhaps I'm contemplating, or is it kind of the FX other issues around IA?\nSanjay Mehta: Sure, C.J. So yeah, so I think when you think of the product mix, there is some mix degradation within Semi Test, but also as there's less wireless test, which is higher than the corporate average and less than expected IA, which is higher than the corporate average. So you are seeing mix. But a couple of other drivers that I noted in my prepared remarks. And that is we've spent a lot of effort and money on making our supply chain resilient through component qualification through multi-country manufacturing, et cetera. A lot of those costs are going to be incurred in 2022 and the second half of 2022. So we have those that significantly curtail, there will be some in 2023, but that will curtail the majority of them in 2022. So think of those as transitory. And then we're also seeing a little bit of wage inflation for both ourselves and our partners.\nC.J. Muse: Very helpful. I guess as my follow-up, in terms of the slowdown that you're seeing in test, are you seeing pushouts or actual cancellations? And then as you think about 2023, obviously, a lot of changes afoot in terms of heterogeneous compute, larger dye sizes, smaller dye sizes with chiplets advanced packaging. I'm curious how you're thinking about that net effect into 2023 and how you -- whether we could see growth or further declines and what your market share might look like? Thanks so much.\nMark Jagiela: Thank you. Yeah. So on the heterogeneous computing and the effects in 2023, I think that's all positive for us. 3-nanometer is coming as planned. We don't see any changes or delays in anything associated with that. The trends toward chiplets, multichip packages and the associated test intensity increase around known good dye, more pins to test in a chiplet design than there would be in a monolithic design. All are tailwinds for test. Now those have been occurring in the market and we'll continue to phase in over the next several years as that method of, let's say, package assembly gains more and more prevalence. So that is another one of the tailwinds that gives us confidence in the midterm earning model that we produced earlier in the year. So no change to our beliefs around 2023 at this point. And in terms of pushouts versus cancellations versus anything else, we're not seeing any cancellations. But what we have seen is that there's been a few pushouts, but more significantly, we do hold some capacity in place for some of our key customers on a basically 12 to 16-week delivery window basis that were unbooked and it's the demand for those unordered testers principally that disappeared.\nC.J. Muse: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Graham [ph] of Loop Capital. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question, and welcome aboard, Greg. I have two maybe more 40,000-foot theoreticals, if you don't mind. The first is when we started the year, largest customer decides to curtail tester purchases, because I think as we've determined to be correct, that their complexity in this year's launch, it was just not enough to warrant a new tester that the idea was that next year, their 2023 launch would have much more complexity aided by 3-nanometer. Has -- with the smartphone market weaker today, has anything changed that framework in your mind, or more -- perhaps even more importantly, if I may, what your largest customer is saying to you, Mark?\nMark Jagiela: Yeah, no changes on that front. Our largest customer has fared pretty well this year despite overall unit declines in smartphones. And so it's a bright spot, if anything else that that segment of the smartphone market is robust. And we expect -- and every -- there's nothing we've heard that would change our view of 2023.\nUnidentified Analyst: Very good. And then as far as this whole six to 12-month slowdown that you've seen in the past, which is obviously documented in the numbers, Mark, in your eyes, does that actually start in 3Q because the first half was more a Teradyne specific thing with that large customer? Does that essentially six to 12-month timetable start now?\nMark Jagiela: Yes. I would suggest it starts in third quarter because you're right, the first half market declines were pretty isolated to one customer having that big of an impact on the overall view of the market. What we're into now is something more classical, I think. It's certainly -- and part of this, again, I'll caution is a projection on our part. We've seen it now in the smartphone side but we believe and sense that it's coming in a broader set of markets like compute and infrastructure. And there's inventory overhangs as well out there that typically in phases like this go through a digestion phase and working down inventory levels take that sort of six to 12-month period. And we think that as we head into lower economic growth periods and a little bit more inventory in the channel than historically has been there -- that people are going to tighten down a bit and it's going to slow demand for repeat orders for devices in those categories. So yes, starts in Q3, six to 12-months, I think, is a safe bet, and we'll see how it plays out.\nUnidentified Analyst: Mark, if I could just sneak this one in. By extension to that -- thank you for that by the way. By extension to that, does the 2024 framework now is at the lower end of that maybe more likely, or is the lower end in jeopardy? I'm just wondering because you didn't put that framework into the deck?\nMark Jagiela: No, I think -- look, I think if you look at the history of the market, that 2024 framework, our earnings model and projection is intact and in play, and I wouldn't characterize it as low end either. When you look at how much the markets move up and down year-to-year historically, we could easily see a snapback of 20%, 30% growth in a subsequent year. So I wouldn't call 2024 in any way based on what we're seeing right now.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you. Very helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Chin of Stifel. Your line is open.\nBrian Chin: Good morning and thanks for letting us ask a few questions. Maybe just backtrack to the $600 million reduction in the SOC TAM. Can you maybe just delineate again whether it's mobility versus compute within that reduction? And also just sort of zooming in on the compute TAM, are you seeing or anticipating any weakness outside of processors for client PCs, hyperscale or server high-performance compute chips as well?\nSanjay Mehta: I'll take the TAM side of it. So where we're seeing in our estimates really tied to our $4.4 million -- sorry, $4.4 billion midpoint, we're seeing about $300 million, our estimate is a $300 million decline in compute, $400 million decline in mobility and an increase in auto of about $100 million. So that's really, Brian, where we're seeing it.\nMark Jagiela: And then on the question of where in the compute market are we anticipating or getting some early signals of weakness. Certainly, right now, the immediate corrections are occurring related to consumer laptops, a little bit of enterprise PC area. We're not seeing at the moment the correction in cloud infrastructure or service. However, there are I would say, discussions going on in those areas that suggest that that's probably coming. And so part of what we've assumed in our both market projections and Q4 revenue projections are some declines starting in Q4 in those segments, modest relative to mobility, however.\nBrian Chin: Okay. That's interesting. Maybe just switching gears then back to automation. We've also heard that supply issues, not even your MiR, but for other complementary products like 3D cameras or conveyance had also been delaying automation projects. I'm curious if that's something you're also seeing? And then kind of second part of that is, and it's not totally fair to ask, but -- how are you thinking about IA growth rates for next year given the existing and anticipated headwinds, including demand, not only supply?\nGreg Smith: So -- hi, this is Greg. The -- in terms of supply issues, we are definitely hearing from our partners that they are having trouble procuring some elements of the solutions that they're building. And I think that's part of the headwind that we're seeing in North America that there's staff constraints, and there's also a large number of partially complete projects that they need to get off of their books. So we expect as those supply constraints start to ease, that will come off as a constraint. And we think that, that will probably happen towards the latter part of this year. In terms of growth projections for 2023, it's very early, but we don't see any reason to really deviate from the 30% to 45% range that we've been talking about in terms of IA growth long-term, because the end market fundamentals are very, very strong. We have very low market penetration and labor scarcity is still a big factor in all of the markets where we play.\nBrian Chin: Okay. Thanks Greg. I appreciate the color.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho of Deutsche Bank.\nSidney Ho: Great. Thanks. I want to double-click on the mobility market. I think most of us understand the order pattern of the largest customer. But excluding that customer is your revenue growth more closely tied to smartphone sales, meaning they are more reflective of current demand? The reason I ask is that if we start hearing smartphone inventory getting closer to normal levels, say, by the end of this year, does that mean you will start seeing more tested revenue growth in Q1, or do we have to wait a little longer because your customers may not meet extra tested capacity until later?\nMark Jagiela: Yeah. So good question. I would roughly say that in the smartphone world, tester capacity precedes unit production by about three months. So what we're seeing in the decline in our third quarter for tester capacity demand reflects a unit production reduction of smartphones in the fourth quarter primarily. So if we're thinking about next year, then we would -- we should start to see tester demand pick back up three months prior to major phone launches or a return to growth in the China market, for example, that's sort of the model.\nSidney Ho: Okay. That's helpful. My follow-up question is on the memory test. You called out the strength in memory test in second quarter, and you still expect the TAM to be about $1 billion this year. But many memory suppliers are likely going to cut CapEx quite a bit and slow down production. When do you think you will feel these adjustments in your revenue, or is increased complexity and market share gains enough to offset these headwinds? Thanks.\nMark Jagiela: Yeah. I think in memory, it's a little different -- and we don't expect to see much of a correction because there's some tester obsolescence occurring in the new DDR5 and LPDDR5 interfaces that are growing in share in the DRAM world, require brand-new testers. And all the fab capacity that's been put in place in 2022 to produce that class of device that should start growing in the server world and in the phone world in 2023 will need to be facilitated with testers in the second half of this year going into next year. So I think there's a bit of a lag between the CapEx investment on the front end and the tester investment on the back end. And we think at least through the early part of 2023, despite what we're hearing in memory from the suppliers in terms of bit growth and everything else that these obsolescence -- technological obsolescence events will have to be solved with additional tester capacity because of the old tester just can't be reused.\nSidney Ho: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore of Morgan Stanley.\nJoseph Moore: Great. Thank you. In the past, you guys have talked about the relationship between the wafer fab equipment market, particularly the logic portion and your SOC test business, obviously, you're kind of diverging now. And I'm not asking you to make a call on WFE, which I think most of us do expect will probably contract. But -- can you just talk a little bit about that relationship and discontraction that you're seeing seems a little bit at odds with how much logic capacity is coming online and which -- how much stuff would presumably need to be tested? Just give us some context on that relationship.\nMark Jagiela: You're right, it is at odds. It doesn't correlate well. It suggest that there would be some underutilized -- either underutilized fab capacity for a period of time or there will be wafer die banking going on. In other words, the fabs will keep running, but the devices themselves may sit untested, undiced, unpackaged for some period of time. So I think that is likely to be the case for a little bit of a period of time coming in the next six to 9 months. But usually, historically, that washes itself out at the back end of the six to 12-month correction. But that's kind of what I would expect.\nJoseph Moore: Okay. Thank you. And then for my follow-up, on the last question you kind of referenced technology transitions in memory. If you talked about DDR5, I didn't hear it, but can you talk a little bit about is DDR5 timing getting pushed back? Is that a factor in DRAM being a little lower this year, and what does that tell you about kind of your Memory business prospects for next year?\nMark Jagiela: Yes, it absolutely does. This year, we expected -- if you go back to the fourth quarter of last year, the DDR5 would be a bigger part of the market in our business in 2022. With the delay of Sapphire Rapids and such into 2023, a lot of that tooling pushed out. However, the market kind of held up because what filled in behind that was pretty robust investment for some new suppliers in China. All year long, they've been very aggressively ramping capacity. And so it turns out, despite the delay in DDR5, 2022 is a pretty good year for Memory. So when we look into 2023, there could be a little bit more of an incremental delay. I think everybody is hearing about maybe Sapphire Rapids is going to get split out another few months or so. But it's coming. We're getting close to escape velocity, I think. So -- and we're seeing the orders, we're seeing the orders for capacity for that coming in now. So that's what gives us some pretty -- a little bit more confidence on the Memory side than we're seeing on the SOC side.\nJoseph Moore: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar of Cowen. Your line is open.\nKrish Sankar: Question -- I had two of them. First on Mark or Greg, to the extent you can answer it, a question on next year. Do you worry that if and when mobile demand starts getting better next year and the auto industrial segment could rollover, and wouldn't that be more detrimental to your margins, how do you think about that transition? If you can answer it, and then I have a follow-up.\nMark Jagiela: Yeah, I don't think the margin between auto and mobile is that significant for us, frankly. I wouldn't say that there's a mix shift going on there that it's going to be a headwind or a tailwind. They're pretty blended close to each other. As to when we would expect mobile to return, that's -- we know at least from the pattern from our largest customer that that's a Q2, 3Q phenomena. And we see no change to that timing just based on their product introduction cycles. So for Teradyne's point of view, we would expect the big changes to occur in those two periods. There should be a little bit of pickup in Q1, a modest pickup, I would say, related to some other manufacturers, phone introductions, but 2Q, 3Q is the big quarter.\nKrish Sankar: Got it, got it. That's very helpful. And then a follow-up, you touched upon a little bit of a decoupling between front-end WFE and test investments. I just wanted to like go into one subset of that, which is China. It seems like some of the Chinese OSATs have slowed down spending, but the front-end spending is still continuing. I'm just kind of curious of your view on how China evolves for test spending and for Teledyne?\nMark Jagiela: Yeah, China is -- and it's not just China, but I would say that the fab investments generally speaking are continuing unabated. Going back to that utilization question, you could make the argument that the 3-nanometer investments that have been made going back now over a year are hugely underutilized because no revenue is yet to be produced off of that. So the tooling -- the advanced time to tool and tune the recipe for 3-nanometer has become an unprecedentedly long cycle. And so all of that fab capacity is, \u201cunderutilized\u201d until next year revenue starts flowing' specifically back to China. There's a disconnect between test, lead times and thinking and fab times. Fabs tend to get put in a whole slug of capacity with all of the front-end equipment installed quarters before production starts. Test tends to be added as a spot market ad. So once the fab starts running, the initial capacity gets facilitated in test in a quarter, devices ramp up an output of the fab ramps up in subsequent quarters and incrementally test ramps up as well. So test is a much smoother deployment than a fab. And then the last thing, of course, going on in China, I think, is just the national priority around independence and access to technology has focused mainly on fab technology and therefore, it's the most, I would say, viewed as threatening and enabling at the same time. And therefore, there's been a more, I'd say, resilient maybe counter economical push to invest in fab capacity there. Our business in China is very strong. We have one major headwind, which is the largest single consumer of test equipment in China, Huawei is somebody we cannot serve. But outside of that, we have a very strong business and a very decent growth that we're seeing there.\nKrish Sankar: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Mehdi Hosseini of SIG. Your line is open.\nMehdi Hosseini: Thanks for taking my question. I want to go back to SOC test. Mark, when I look at the trends since 2015, the SOC test grew on a year-over-year basis. And perhaps there are two factors there. The parallel test went away towards the end of the last decade and also the 5G that helped -- have started to be incremental in late 2019. And now we're here, you're guiding to $4.4 billion, which is still above the 2020 level. So with that as a context, what gives you the confidence that we should see a quick snapback in SOC test in 2023 especially since your largest customer is expected to continue with bifurcation, not moving everything to the next leading nation? And I have a follow-up.\nMark Jagiela: Okay. Good, Mehdi. You're right. Monotonic growth since 2015 has been true. And even with the $4.4 billion current midpoint view of the market in 2022, the trend line growth off of 2015 is still a 10% CAGR. And we said all along, we run the business and expect volatility and manage the business to the trend line. And the 10% CAGR is in line with our midterm earnings model, too. So it's hard after so many years of monotonic sequential growth maybe to absorb that. But I think most of all of us have been around long enough to know that's part of history and not strange, so the snapback or not in 2023. One thing I might want to just rewind a bit and preface my remarks on is that our tester market and our tester business, demand is very sensitive to the growth rate of our customers. So, for example, if a customer of ours is growing units at 4% and a year and creates a certain tester demand for us. If their growth rate nominally increases from 4% to 5%, small, small impact on their business, for Teradyne, that can be a 20%, 25% acceleration of demand for us because we -- our demand is driven off the first derivative, let's say, of customer growth. And so obviously, we're very sensitive to what the macroeconomic conditions are going to be in 2023 around the growth rate of our customers. The technological issue around our largest customer in the smartphone market and the move to 3-nanometer, I think that's kind of baked in and is going to happen. Macro economically, what's going to be going on in the world and the inventory digestion or not that may be lagging from Q4 into early Q1, it's hard to tell right now. We're kind of reading tea leaves based on what we've seen happen, which I said is maybe about $100 million of demand drop out to what we're anticipating will happen. So I really wouldn't want to get too far out on the limb or forecast in 2023, but those are the factors at play.\nMehdi Hosseini: Thank you. Thanks for the detail. And one quick follow-up for Sanjay. Given all the color and guide, it seems like this year, revenues could be down mid-teens, plus-minus. And you're adjusting your OpEx growth of only 4% to 6%. Looking to next year, if we get a snapback, you do benefit from an easy compare from 2022 into 2023, should I assume that your OpEx growth would accelerate again, or should I assume that the OpEx growth will be minimal to like, let's say, mid-single-digit percent, 5%?\nSanjay Mehta: Yeah. So Mehdi, this year, we had an anticipated plan. And obviously, as Mark said, we manage the business on a trend line, and we believe the fundamentals that we laid out in our January call and the earnings model are still intact in Test and IA. With that backdrop, we did have a plan to increase OpEx 11% to 13%. And as I noted, we curtailed that, we believe in delaying some expenditures that aren't going to impact our long-term competitiveness. We haven't gone through the detailed planning in 2023. Of course, we'll provide that update in January. But my expectation is that we're going to keep the focus on what's going to help us be successful in the long-term. And we're going to -- for example, we're going to keep on investing in industrial automation to secure the market going forward. We believe that that market is still sub-5% penetrated very good positions in our portfolio companies that go to market in that fashion. So my expectation is we're going to still operate at the 5% to 15% there and still keep our foot on the gas to grow to help drive that top line and capture more business. And in the Test portfolio, we're going to continue to ensure we have a very strong road map and a good go-to-market the exact numbers I don't have right now, but the fundamentals of our business are the same. We're going through -- we're predicting to go through a little bit of a weaker second half than we anticipated. But at some point, this will snap back, which quarter that occurs. But we're going to keep our investment thesis intact.\nMark Jagiela: And variable comp pool with revenue as we talked earlier.\nMehdi Hosseini: Right. Thank you.\nAndy Blanchard: Okay. Folks, we are out of time. Mehdi, thank you for the question, and thanks, everybody for their questions and attention. If you have follow-ups, please reach out, and we look forward to talking to you in the days and weeks ahead. Bye-bye.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Mark Jagiela",
            "content": "Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Greg will summarize our Q2 results, and I'll comment on the full year outlook and technology drivers we expect in 2023. Sanjay will then take you through the financial details, including our outlook for the third quarter. Greg? Thanks, Greg. While the long-term drivers in our test and automation markets remain firmly in place, the recent deceleration we're experiencing in test will impact our full year results. Over the past few weeks, we've seen a marked slowdown in SOC and wireless tester demand in the second half related to declines in end market shipments of smartphones, compute products and associated infrastructure. These demand adjustments are -- these demand adjustments are happening in real time, and we are projecting this will continue over the next several weeks as the market continues to align their production plans and inventory levels to this new reality. This extends across multiple customers and device types, including apps processors, power management and RF. I will note that auto MCU, industrial and memory test demand remains strong entering Q3 and we've seen no deceleration of demand in these markets. When forecasting the second half of 2022, we are expecting the test realignments we've seen in the past few weeks are not a blip and that further adjustments are coming. Beyond the reductions we've already seen, several customers have indicated they are in a capital review phase, which we are assuming will lead to some additional impact to Q4 demand. At a macro level, we also assume that China's smartphone volumes will not accelerate through the remainder of the year. We also believe that short-term global economic conditions will remain weak, resulting in softening consumer demand and associated electronics inventory digestion. In IA, we forecast that our second half business will continue to grow at about a 20% year-over-year level, consistent with our achievements in the first half, but below our 35% goal. As Greg highlighted, we believe that China demand will remain muted. Distributor labor shortages in North America will limit the rate of installation expansion in the short-term and FX headwinds will not abate. Summing it all up, we now expect our second half revenue to be slightly lower than the first half, resulting in a roughly 52%, 48% first half, second half split. Our latest forecast projects that 2022 SOC test market will be in the range of $4.2 billion to $4.6 billion, down from our April estimate of about $5 billion, while in memory, we expect the market will remain at about $1 billion. To reiterate, much of our forecasted slowdown assumes continued yet to be identified demand decline in the fourth quarter. Looking further ahead, after six consecutive years of robust SOC test market growth, we have entered a period of demand slowdown in digestion. This is not uncommon as we've seen this most recently in 2013 and 2015. And over the years, we've built our operating model to anticipate this kind of demand swings. Predicting the depth and duration of these corrections is challenging, but in each of the last three corrections, growth returned after six to 12 months with the subsequent year showing strong growth. The ramp of 3-nanometer starting in 2023, followed by gate all around and increasing multi-chip packaging remains unaltered drivers of growth ahead. Interface transitions in both Flash and DRAM are also imminent. Hyperscalers continue to expand their chip design starts and AJI [ph] as a new class of silicon application gaining momentum. In Industrial Automation, the value proposition has only strengthened as the short ROI remains compelling, while increased resiliency in a world of questionable labor supply as another motivation to automate. So while the first half of 2022 unfolded roughly as outlined in January, the second half is looking considerably softer as we than we expected just three months ago. However, we are confident of our long-term growth strategy and are focused on execution of our design-ins and R&D programs so that we are positioned to capitalize on growth of these markets that we serve. Sanjay will now take you through the financial details. Sanjay? Yeah. Roughly speaking, those are about right. And I think, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, maybe we probably reduced our second half revenue targets somewhere between $300 million to $350 million. About one-third of that is known customer weakening where the demand has been communicated to us to have soften. Two-thirds of it is just a projection of more to come of that vein based on conversations that are just beginning with customers. So there's not a clear -- and all of this is mostly related to test. So there's not sort of a clear identified two-thirds of that decline portion, but it's just the experience we've seen in prior cycles and the test industry suggest that there's more to come. If you go back to 2013, for example, when the market went through a significant 30% year-over-year correction, this was the beginning of that kind of trend. Now here, we're talking about a market correcting about 9% off of the peak of last year. So a much more modest correction -- but that's -- this is kind of how the market turns and we're using history to guide us in how we're projecting these yet to be identified digestion phases. Yeah. I think our exposure to Android smartphones is a little bit higher this year than it's been in past years. We've picked up a little bit of market share in that segment. Obviously, that segment is down significantly this year in unit volume. So that's having the -- that's principally the reason for the declines we're forecasting here in the second half. Now when we look at 2023, it's hard to tell what's going to happen with the Android phones, part of what's happened in 2022 in terms of the declines related to China -- and part of this is predicting how China will rebound in 2023 as consumer demand hopefully recovers. But we don't have a strong forecast for the Android sub-segment of smartphones yet for 2023. So I can't really give you a lot of color on that. Yeah. I think -- so there's two pieces of Semi Test Memory and SOC Memory, it's going to be 40-ish percent market share, consistent with last year. On SOC, it really depends on what happens on the compute side in terms of how much decline happens in the market on compute, which is more of our competitors, strong soup. So we've baked in a significant decline in mobility. We believe a decline in compute is imminent -- but that's something that I think over the next few weeks, as we hear from our competitor, we'll know more about. All that being said, I think our statistical share is in the upper -- mid- to upper 30% range in SOC Test this year. But that's based on, again, strong compute market, weak mobility market versus customer switching suppliers and that moves around quite a bit year-to-year. No, not really. Most of the weakness we're baking in, again, in the fourth quarter that we've yet to really get confirmation on is in more in mobility and compute and infrastructure. But we think industrial and auto will remain strong through the end of the year. Thank you. Yeah. So on the heterogeneous computing and the effects in 2023, I think that's all positive for us. 3-nanometer is coming as planned. We don't see any changes or delays in anything associated with that. The trends toward chiplets, multichip packages and the associated test intensity increase around known good dye, more pins to test in a chiplet design than there would be in a monolithic design. All are tailwinds for test. Now those have been occurring in the market and we'll continue to phase in over the next several years as that method of, let's say, package assembly gains more and more prevalence. So that is another one of the tailwinds that gives us confidence in the midterm earning model that we produced earlier in the year. So no change to our beliefs around 2023 at this point. And in terms of pushouts versus cancellations versus anything else, we're not seeing any cancellations. But what we have seen is that there's been a few pushouts, but more significantly, we do hold some capacity in place for some of our key customers on a basically 12 to 16-week delivery window basis that were unbooked and it's the demand for those unordered testers principally that disappeared. Yeah, no changes on that front. Our largest customer has fared pretty well this year despite overall unit declines in smartphones. And so it's a bright spot, if anything else that that segment of the smartphone market is robust. And we expect -- and every -- there's nothing we've heard that would change our view of 2023. Yes. I would suggest it starts in third quarter because you're right, the first half market declines were pretty isolated to one customer having that big of an impact on the overall view of the market. What we're into now is something more classical, I think. It's certainly -- and part of this, again, I'll caution is a projection on our part. We've seen it now in the smartphone side but we believe and sense that it's coming in a broader set of markets like compute and infrastructure. And there's inventory overhangs as well out there that typically in phases like this go through a digestion phase and working down inventory levels take that sort of six to 12-month period. And we think that as we head into lower economic growth periods and a little bit more inventory in the channel than historically has been there -- that people are going to tighten down a bit and it's going to slow demand for repeat orders for devices in those categories. So yes, starts in Q3, six to 12-months, I think, is a safe bet, and we'll see how it plays out. No, I think -- look, I think if you look at the history of the market, that 2024 framework, our earnings model and projection is intact and in play, and I wouldn't characterize it as low end either. When you look at how much the markets move up and down year-to-year historically, we could easily see a snapback of 20%, 30% growth in a subsequent year. So I wouldn't call 2024 in any way based on what we're seeing right now. And then on the question of where in the compute market are we anticipating or getting some early signals of weakness. Certainly, right now, the immediate corrections are occurring related to consumer laptops, a little bit of enterprise PC area. We're not seeing at the moment the correction in cloud infrastructure or service. However, there are I would say, discussions going on in those areas that suggest that that's probably coming. And so part of what we've assumed in our both market projections and Q4 revenue projections are some declines starting in Q4 in those segments, modest relative to mobility, however. Yeah. So good question. I would roughly say that in the smartphone world, tester capacity precedes unit production by about three months. So what we're seeing in the decline in our third quarter for tester capacity demand reflects a unit production reduction of smartphones in the fourth quarter primarily. So if we're thinking about next year, then we would -- we should start to see tester demand pick back up three months prior to major phone launches or a return to growth in the China market, for example, that's sort of the model. Yeah. I think in memory, it's a little different -- and we don't expect to see much of a correction because there's some tester obsolescence occurring in the new DDR5 and LPDDR5 interfaces that are growing in share in the DRAM world, require brand-new testers. And all the fab capacity that's been put in place in 2022 to produce that class of device that should start growing in the server world and in the phone world in 2023 will need to be facilitated with testers in the second half of this year going into next year. So I think there's a bit of a lag between the CapEx investment on the front end and the tester investment on the back end. And we think at least through the early part of 2023, despite what we're hearing in memory from the suppliers in terms of bit growth and everything else that these obsolescence -- technological obsolescence events will have to be solved with additional tester capacity because of the old tester just can't be reused. You're right, it is at odds. It doesn't correlate well. It suggest that there would be some underutilized -- either underutilized fab capacity for a period of time or there will be wafer die banking going on. In other words, the fabs will keep running, but the devices themselves may sit untested, undiced, unpackaged for some period of time. So I think that is likely to be the case for a little bit of a period of time coming in the next six to 9 months. But usually, historically, that washes itself out at the back end of the six to 12-month correction. But that's kind of what I would expect. Yes, it absolutely does. This year, we expected -- if you go back to the fourth quarter of last year, the DDR5 would be a bigger part of the market in our business in 2022. With the delay of Sapphire Rapids and such into 2023, a lot of that tooling pushed out. However, the market kind of held up because what filled in behind that was pretty robust investment for some new suppliers in China. All year long, they've been very aggressively ramping capacity. And so it turns out, despite the delay in DDR5, 2022 is a pretty good year for Memory. So when we look into 2023, there could be a little bit more of an incremental delay. I think everybody is hearing about maybe Sapphire Rapids is going to get split out another few months or so. But it's coming. We're getting close to escape velocity, I think. So -- and we're seeing the orders, we're seeing the orders for capacity for that coming in now. So that's what gives us some pretty -- a little bit more confidence on the Memory side than we're seeing on the SOC side. Yeah, I don't think the margin between auto and mobile is that significant for us, frankly. I wouldn't say that there's a mix shift going on there that it's going to be a headwind or a tailwind. They're pretty blended close to each other. As to when we would expect mobile to return, that's -- we know at least from the pattern from our largest customer that that's a Q2, 3Q phenomena. And we see no change to that timing just based on their product introduction cycles. So for Teradyne's point of view, we would expect the big changes to occur in those two periods. There should be a little bit of pickup in Q1, a modest pickup, I would say, related to some other manufacturers, phone introductions, but 2Q, 3Q is the big quarter. Yeah, China is -- and it's not just China, but I would say that the fab investments generally speaking are continuing unabated. Going back to that utilization question, you could make the argument that the 3-nanometer investments that have been made going back now over a year are hugely underutilized because no revenue is yet to be produced off of that. So the tooling -- the advanced time to tool and tune the recipe for 3-nanometer has become an unprecedentedly long cycle. And so all of that fab capacity is, \u201cunderutilized\u201d until next year revenue starts flowing' specifically back to China.

So test is a much smoother deployment than a fab.

And therefore, there's been a more, I'd say, resilient maybe counter economical push to invest in fab capacity there. Our business in China is very strong. We have one major headwind, which is the largest single consumer of test equipment in China, Huawei is somebody we cannot serve. But outside of that, we have a very strong business and a very decent growth that we're seeing there. Okay. Good, Mehdi. You're right. Monotonic growth since 2015 has been true. And even with the $4.4 billion current midpoint view of the market in 2022, the trend line growth off of 2015 is still a 10% CAGR. And we said all along, we run the business and expect volatility and manage the business to the trend line. And the 10% CAGR is in line with our midterm earnings model, too. So it's hard after so many years of monotonic sequential growth maybe to absorb that. But I think most of all of us have been around long enough to know that's part of history and not strange, so the snapback or not in 2023. One thing I might want to just rewind a bit and preface my remarks on is that our tester market and our tester business, demand is very sensitive to the growth rate of our customers. So, for example, if a customer of ours is growing units at 4% and a year and creates a certain tester demand for us. If their growth rate nominally increases from 4% to 5%, small, small impact on their business, for Teradyne, that can be a 20%, 25% acceleration of demand for us because we -- our demand is driven off the first derivative, let's say, of customer growth. And so obviously, we're very sensitive to what the macroeconomic conditions are going to be in 2023 around the growth rate of our customers. The technological issue around our largest customer in the smartphone market and the move to 3-nanometer, I think that's kind of baked in and is going to happen. Macro economically, what's going to be going on in the world and the inventory digestion or not that may be lagging from Q4 into early Q1, it's hard to tell right now. We're kind of reading tea leaves based on what we've seen happen, which I said is maybe about $100 million of demand drop out to what we're anticipating will happen. So I really wouldn't want to get too far out on the limb or forecast in 2023, but those are the factors at play. And variable comp pool with revenue as we talked earlier."

            "name": "Sanjay Mehta",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll provide details on our Q2 results, offer additional color on how we're addressing the slowdown in some markets and supply shortages and others and describe our Q3 outlook. Now to Q2. Second quarter sales were $841 million with non-GAAP EPS of $1.21, non-GAAP gross margins were 60.2% and our non-GAAP operating expenses were $251 million, $14 million below mid guidance. The main driver -- sorry -- the main driver of the lower than planned OpEx was an Industrial Automation Group or IAG due to lower variable compensation tied to lower revenue projections and slower than planned hiring. Non-GAAP operating profit rate was 30.3% we had two 10% customers in the quarter. The tax rate, excluding discrete items for the quarter was 16.9% on a non-GAAP basis. Please note, you should now use 16.5% for the full year non-GAAP tax rate. Looking at the results from a business unit perspective. Semi Test revenue was $541 million. SOC revenue was $461 million, driven by strength in automotive and industrial markets. Memory revenue was $81 million, led by flash final test and DRAM wafer sort. System Test group had revenue of $135 million, which was up 29% year-over-year. Storage Test sales, including both HDD and system-level test solutions were $86 million in the quarter, up 49% from Q2 2021. Defense and aerospace and production board test combined grew 4% year-on-year. At LitePoint, revenue of $64 million was up 16% from prior year due primarily to strong shipments in Wi-Fi 6C and Wi-Fi 7 and UWB test systems. Now to Industrial Automation. Industrial Automation revenue of $101 million in Q2 was up 10% year-over-year. This was lower than expected, as Greg noted. Despite the lower growth, we still expect IA revenue to follow the historical pattern and grow as we move through the year. UR sales were $83 million in Q2, up 8% year-over-year with the highest growth in Northern Europe. MiR sales were $17 million, up 9% from Q2 2021 in the quarter. From a financial perspective, in IA the group was slightly under breakeven on a non-GAAP operating basis in the second quarter. And for the full year, we expect to be towards the low end of the 5% to 15% profit range we discussed in past calls. We view the roughly 20% growth rate in IA as a short-term situation, as Greg noted. Like the company model, the IAG Group operating model naturally flex spending down based on profitability, and we're tightening discretionary spending where appropriate. But our long-term IA growth strategy and related investment plans remain unchanged. Shifting to supply. Our Q2 guidance excluded approximately $50 million of revenue tied to our inability to supply customer demand. In Q3, we're excluding a similar $50 million of revenue from our guidance range, primarily in our test businesses. The shortage of semiconductors ranging from FPGAs to industrial analog continues to impact our production. As I've noted in prior calls, we're taking numerous actions to harden our supply chain but even with these actions, we expect supply line constraints to remain challenging. I will note these actions and other factors improved our supply situation in Q2, mainly in test, which enabled higher shipments. Shifting to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our cash and marketable securities at the end of the quarter totaled approximately $900 million, down from $1.2 billion at the end of Q1. We had $70 million in free cash flow in the quarter, reflecting the timing of shipments and supplier prepayments. Over 80% of our shipments occurred in May and June saw our DSO expanded to 74 days, which we expect will decline in the second half of the year. Other uses of cash in the quarter included share buybacks of $331 million, dividend payments of $18 million and debt retirement of $22 million. At the end of Q2, we're more than two-thirds of the way through our $750 million share repurchase plan for 2022 with $217 million remaining. In October -- sorry, in our October call, we'll note any updates to our share buyback plan. Regarding debt. To date, $386 million of convertible bonds have early converted. I'd also like to note several points regarding the strong US dollar and its impact on our results. In our Test portfolio, the majority of revenue and expense are in dollars, so there's not a material foreign exchange impact. In IA businesses, on the other hand, have a large amount of euro-linked expenses and about 50% of their revenue is tied to the euro. The result as the strong dollar reduces IA's revenue and gross margin in dollars. In the first half, the FX impact reduced our IA growth rate approximately four points. Assuming exchange rates remain consistent with July's exchange rate, we expect six points of growth headwind for the full year compared to our January projection. For IA, the strengthening dollar has a marginal benefit on the OpEx side. IA revenue and margin degradation is offset by the OpEx gain, yielding a neutral effect on our operating profit for that segment. Now to our outlook for Q3. A combination of slowing demand and test, extending lead times due to material shortages and reduced automation demand in Europe and China results in a lower Q3 outlook than we expected three months ago. As noted, the guidance excludes approximately $50 million of shipments due to material shortages primarily in test. Also, the guidance assumes we won't see any extended shutdowns of production facilities due to COVID, and we won't see any new trade restrictions. With that said, sales in Q3 are expected to be between $760 million and $840 million, with non-GAAP EPS in a range of $0.90 to $1.16 on 166 million diluted shares. The third quarter guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles. Third quarter gross margins are estimated at 58% to 59%, down from Q2 due to product mix, 2022 investment supply chain resiliency and wage inflation. Some of these effects are transitory, and we expect our mid-term earnings model gross margin range of 59% to 60% to remain intact. OpEx is expected to run at 31% to 34% of third quarter sales. The non-GAAP operating profit rate at the midpoint of our third quarter guidance is 26%. As Mark noted, we expect second half revenue to be below the first half, approximately 48% of full year sales. Given the reduced revenue outlook for the second half of the year, our operating expenses are now planned to grow just 4% to 6% annually versus 11% to 13% planned in our prior guidance. The OpEx reduction from prior guide is driven by two factors. First, our variable compensation model is approximately half of the decline tied to reduced revenue. Second, we have delayed some expenditures in both test and IA, which we believe will not impact our long-run competitiveness. Spending savings are roughly evenly split between engineering and go-to-market. Summing it all up, we're expecting revenue and profit in Q3 and the second half of the year to be lower than we projected three months ago, but our operating model is resilient to varying revenue levels. With the reduced revenue level, our model reduces variable compensation expense, and we're taking other steps as appropriate. A downturn is always challenging, but we're confident we have the operating model, strategy and experience to lead us through whatever lies ahead, while keeping our focus on the needs of our customers and the long-term opportunities in the test and industrial automation markets. With that, I'll turn things over to Andy. It's Sanjay. So just a couple of comments on our business model as it relates to cost structure. So as you know, the majority of our test portfolio has contract manufacturing. So it really provides great scalability up and down with our outsourced partners fixed assets. So that helps on the margin line. But then from an operating expense perspective, we have a key portion of our wages in a flexible or variable compensation plan that is that as revenue and profit goes up, that is passed along part of it to the employees. But as it goes down, which is one of -- it's about half of the driver of the growth reduction from a midpoint of 12% expected this year to a midpoint of 5%, as I noted in my prepared remarks, about half of that growth reduction is driven by the variable compensation. So we believe as time moves on and let's say, the market goes lower, we'll have the ability to reduce our operating expenses on a variable basis while keeping our workforce intact and investing for the long-term. And, obviously, as the market rebounds or increases, our revenue goes up, then that will increase our operating expenses on a variable basis. Sure, C.J. So yeah, so I think when you think of the product mix, there is some mix degradation within Semi Test, but also as there's less wireless test, which is higher than the corporate average and less than expected IA, which is higher than the corporate average. So you are seeing mix. But a couple of other drivers that I noted in my prepared remarks. And that is we've spent a lot of effort and money on making our supply chain resilient through component qualification through multi-country manufacturing, et cetera. A lot of those costs are going to be incurred in 2022 and the second half of 2022. So we have those that significantly curtail, there will be some in 2023, but that will curtail the majority of them in 2022. So think of those as transitory. And then we're also seeing a little bit of wage inflation for both ourselves and our partners. I'll take the TAM side of it. So where we're seeing in our estimates really tied to our $4.4 million -- sorry, $4.4 billion midpoint, we're seeing about $300 million, our estimate is a $300 million decline in compute, $400 million decline in mobility and an increase in auto of about $100 million. So that's really, Brian, where we're seeing it. Yeah. So Mehdi, this year, we had an anticipated plan. And obviously, as Mark said, we manage the business on a trend line, and we believe the fundamentals that we laid out in our January call and the earnings model are still intact in Test and IA. With that backdrop, we did have a plan to increase OpEx 11% to 13%. And as I noted, we curtailed that, we believe in delaying some expenditures that aren't going to impact our long-term competitiveness. We haven't gone through the detailed planning in 2023. Of course, we'll provide that update in January. But my expectation is that we're going to keep the focus on what's going to help us be successful in the long-term. And we're going to -- for example, we're going to keep on investing in industrial automation to secure the market going forward. We believe that that market is still sub-5% penetrated very good positions in our portfolio companies that go to market in that fashion. So my expectation is we're going to still operate at the 5% to 15% there and still keep our foot on the gas to grow to help drive that top line and capture more business. And in the Test portfolio, we're going to continue to ensure we have a very strong road map and a good go-to-market the exact numbers I don't have right now, but the fundamentals of our business are the same. We're going through -- we're predicting to go through a little bit of a weaker second half than we anticipated. But at some point, this will snap back, which quarter that occurs. But we're going to keep our investment thesis intact."

            "name": "Greg Smith",
            "content": "Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Teradyne's second quarter sales and profits were above the midpoint of our guidance in revenue and profit with sales of $841 million and $1.21 in non-GAAP earnings per share. From a market perspective, we're seeing mixed signals. While the pressure to improve lead times in some test markets is as strong as ever, and we continue to work through supply issues, we have seen some softening in mobility demand, our largest test market. Also, it now looks like IA growth in the second half will be similar to first half growth. In today's call, we'll try to provide some context on how we're navigating this complex environment. Diving into the details of the second quarter, semiconductor test revenues were in line with our plan as were profits. The automotive and industrial end markets served by our Eagle platform were notably strong in the quarter. In memory, flash final test and DRAM wafer sort was the strongest markets. From a strategic perspective, Semi Test had a strong quarter of competitive design wins for both R&D applications and for devices that we expect to ramp in volume production over the next year or so. The design wins were in a wide range of end markets. There were Ultra Flex family design wins in mobility, where the systems architecture supports higher throughput for large complex devices especially when time to market is an important factor. Eagle Test had a significant design win in a battery management application where the system's highly accurate voltage measurement capability enables customers to get to market faster with better device specifications, delivering higher value. In Systems test, sales were on plan in the quarter with solid year-on-year growth for storage test and production board test. At LitePoint, strong wireless test demand for Wi-Fi 6C, Wi-Fi 7 R&D and ultra wideband test products drove double-digit year-on-year growth. Notably, we're seeing strong interest in Wi-Fi 7 development test where we are qualified at all major chipset vendors and to date, we have won 20 of 21 design-in opportunities with end product design teams. This sets us up to expand our already high share of Wi-Fi production test as these products ramp. In Industrial Automation, revenues grew 10% from last year's Q2 and 19% for the first half. This lower than planned growth in the first half is attributed to two primary factors and warrants a few comments. The first factor was foreign exchange. The majority of IA revenue is linked to the euro. For example, within Europe, at UR, we saw a robust 34% unit growth in the first half of 2022 but the decline of the euro with respect to the dollar has muted UR revenue growth in that region to 20%. The dollars appreciation was a revenue headwind in the first half and Sanjay will comment further on the full year foreign exchange outlook. The second factor is lower regional demand that can be traced to a variety of region-specific causes, including COVID lockdowns in China and distribution partner staff shortages in North America where end demand remains quite strong. Staff shortages for integration partners is an ongoing challenge. In the past, we've noted that our distribution partners struggle to grow staff at the same rate as IA demand growth. Our strategy to overcome this is to use software technology and plug-and-play applications from UR+ and MiRGo partners to shorten the deployment time to make these critical staff more productive. But an equally important part of the strategy is to build a robust OEM channel. For example, at Universal Robots, our OEM channel, which includes verticals like welding, power grid maintenance and order fulfillment is doing very well, growing 39% in the first half of 2022. The OEM channel is an important complement to our distributor-based channel because these OEM partners deliver a mostly complete solution to their customers that can be put in operation almost immediately. In many cases, these OEMs have an existing distribution network that can reach customers beyond our traditional channel. These partners can scale much more efficiently than distributors that add staff in proportion to revenue growth for customer support. We are actively adding new OEM partners to serve these and new market verticals. Now I'll hand it back to Mark more on the market, the second half outlook and the demand drivers for next year. Hi, this is Greg. Let me try and take that. So we believe that the fundamentals are still very strong in the IA market. The effects of China lockdowns and staff shortages should both eased to some extent through the rest of the year. We believe that the FX headwind is going to be consistent through the rest of this year. We don't see a significant appreciation of the euro. So that translation into dollars is going to continue to take a couple of points off the top in terms of our growth for revenue that's denominated in euros. To your second question, our OEM channel right now, it represents about 16% of overall UR revenue lower for the entirety of the Industrial Automation Group. And it's growing -- for the first half, it grew at 39% and we expect to be able to maintain that kind of a growth rate. So our pricing in the OEM channel is a little bit favorable to pricing through our normal distribution channel. So we don't expect to see any negative impact to profitability as that channel grows. So -- hi, this is Greg. The -- in terms of supply issues, we are definitely hearing from our partners that they are having trouble procuring some elements of the solutions that they're building. And I think that's part of the headwind that we're seeing in North America that there's staff constraints, and there's also a large number of partially complete projects that they need to get off of their books. So we expect as those supply constraints start to ease, that will come off as a constraint. And we think that, that will probably happen towards the latter part of this year. In terms of growth projections for 2023, it's very early, but we don't see any reason to really deviate from the 30% to 45% range that we've been talking about in terms of IA growth long-term, because the end market fundamentals are very, very strong. We have very low market penetration and labor scarcity is still a big factor in all of the markets where we play."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Q1 2022 Teradyne, Inc. Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mr. Andy Blanchard. Mr. Blanchard, the floor is yours.\nAndrew Blanchard: Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our discussion of Teradyne's most recent financial results. I'm joined this morning by our CEO, Mark Jagiela; and our CFO, Sanjay Mehta. Following our opening remarks, we'll provide details of our performance for 2022's first quarter, along with our outlook for the second quarter of 2022.  The press release containing our first quarter results was issued last evening. We're providing slides on the investor page of the website that may be helpful to you in following the discussion. Replay of this call will be available via the same page after the call ends.  The matters that we discuss today will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause Teradyne's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statement contained in our earnings release as well as our most recent SEC filings. Additionally, those forward-looking statements are made as of today, and we take no obligation to update them as a result of developments occurring after this call.  During today's call, we'll make reference to non-GAAP financial measures. We've posted additional information concerning those non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure were available on the Investor page of the website.  Looking ahead, between now and our next earnings call, Teradyne expects to participate in technology or industrial-focused investor conferences hosted by Cowen, Luke Capital, Bank of America, Stifel and Bernstein.  Now let's get on with the rest of the agenda. First, Mark will comment on our recent results and the market conditions as we enter the new quarter. Sanjay will then offer more details on our quarterly results, along with our guidance for the second quarter. We'll then answer your questions, and this call is scheduled for 1 hour. Mark?\nMark Jagiela: Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, I'll summarize our Q1 results, review current market conditions, and provide an update on Q2 and the full year. Sanjay will then take you through the financial details, including our outlook for the second quarter.  The first quarter played out as expected from a financial perspective. We delivered results toward the high end of guidance as we cleared a few more supply chain bottlenecks than expected.  As outlined in January, we expect revenue growth throughout the year as we build toward 2023 and the transition to 3-nanometer. Consequently, we expect roughly 7% to 9% sequential quarter-over-quarter growth throughout the year.  Since January, we've seen incremental strengthening of demand for Semi Test and wireless in the areas of automotive, memory, WiFi 6c and 7. On the other hand, for the first time in 2 years, supply chain challenges are materially impacting our Semi Test shipments. This is reflected in our wider-than-normal revenue guidance range in Q2. Sanjay will describe these details shortly.  From a full year market perspective, we estimate the SOC market is trending to the high end of the $4.6 billion to $5 billion range we discussed in January. Strengthening automotive test demand is one element driving the market increase as both per car content and unit complexity are growing quickly. The accelerating move to electric vehicles is a key part of this increase with EVs growing at a 20% plus CAGR while the chip content of these vehicles is running more than 3x compared to gas-powered cars.  This year, we are seeing particular strength emerging in high-end automotive ADAS processes. Complexity of these processes is approaching the level of high-end cellphone applications processors. Additionally, high-end ADAS processors have about a 3 to 4x longer test time due to the more stringent test requirements for devices used in automotive safety applications. Furthermore, there are usually multiple ADAS processors per vehicle, amplifying the unit demand. Combining the enhanced EV semiconductor content with these ADAS trends, we expect the automotive test market to outgrow the core test market for the receivable future.  Another area of growth is in hyperscaler silicon development. While the material test revenue impact from these complex chips is in 2023 and beyond, both the complexity and pace of development is accelerating. This has been a focused investment area for us over the last 18 months, and we are pleased with our win work -- sorry, pleased with our win rate for these new opportunities.  Shifting to the memory test market. Our market size estimate for the year remains at about $1 billion. But within that, we have seen the DRAM demand soften a bit, offset by an increase in flash demand.  In System Test, defense and aerospace and production board test groups collectively grew over 30% from Q1 '21 on strong automotive board test demand and program buying in defense and aerospace.  In Storage Test, sales were down 28% as expected versus 1Q of '21. Customer concentration here causes this lumpiness, but the long-term complexity and unit demand drivers remain in place.  Our wireless test business at LitePoint remains very healthy with sales growing 26% year-over-year in Q1. Strong demand for emerging WiFi 6c and WiFi 7 standards is driving this growth and the outlook for the year.  LifePoint's strategy delivers high throughput, easy-to-deploy test solutions for the full array of wireless standards. Our chipset test library approach to programming allows customers to shorten their time to market and achieve superior test economics for these emerging standards.  Moving to Industrial Automation. Group revenues were up 29% from Q1 of last year. Demand in North America was particularly strong with 55% growth year-over-year. While we cleared some supply issues at UR rate in the quarter, IA shipments overall continue to be constrained by material shortages.  Globally, the PMIs for the U.S. and Europe remain over 50, while in China, the PMI dipped below 50 in March. We are closely watching to confirm that China data point is a short-term COVID lockdown issue and anticipate recovery in 3Q and 4Q.  Similarly, the conflict in Ukraine slowed EU demand in March and has the potential to impact the European industrial activity throughout the year. While we expect these constraints to continue in 2Q, we do expect IA growth rates to increase through the year as supply constraints ease, AutoGuide begins to ramp shipments and UR and MiR see increased growth on China and EU recovery.  At UR, our OEM welding application continued on a tear with 1Q growth of over 100% compared to 1 year ago. The U.S. geography was also strong with over 50% year-over-year growth. Our UR+ program of plug-and-play applications for our cobots is passing in the 400-product milestone this quarter. Each of these applications leverages an independent third-party developers knowledge of a specific market vertical to solve a specific problem. This application is then certified by UR so our customers can deploy automation solutions quickly by spending less time on programming and integration work. The resulting network effect is a powerful differentiator for us, and we continue to invest to support this growing army of developers.  At MiR, we are seeing two positive trends emerge as we grow the business. First, we are seeing a steady movement toward higher payload, higher ASP AMRs. In 2020, about 10% of our sales were above the 500-kilogram payload range. This moved to 22% in 2021. And in Q1, we saw over 30% of our sales in this class. This represents a broadening of AMR applications to a wider range of material handling tests and manufacturing and logistics.  Second, we are seeing the trend toward both growing fleet sizes and increasing multifactory deployments at major customers. Within these environments, our fleet management software is an increasingly important product differentiator. These larger customers also have demand the uptime and support requirements, which also plays to our strength as MiR is leveraging Teradyne's global support and large account experience to meet these customers' needs in ways that smaller players can't.  With one quarter of 2022 in the books, the year is unfolding roughly in line with our forecast. The incrementally stronger demand in test is being balanced by supply constraints. Longer term, I am encouraged by the continued strength in WFE investments, which fuels our growth; the progress from industry leaders on 3-nanometer technology; the growing opportunity for our human scale automation projects and the resilience of Teradyne's global team and our partners that are enabling us to muscle through some very tough supply and operational constraints.  And before closing, I want to note an important milestone at Teradyne. Mike Bradley will retire from our Board of Directors in May. Mike's Teradyne career spans over 40 years, including 10 years as CEO, helping shape Teradyne's products, business model and culture. Mike has had an incredible impact on our company, our customers and shareholders, and I'm especially appreciative for the help he's given me along the way. Thanks, Mike.  Sanjay will now take you through the financial details. Sanjay?\nSanjay Mehta: Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll provide details on our Q1 results, offer additional color on the operating environment, including the supply line update and describe our Q2 outlook.  Now to Q1. First quarter sales were $755 million, with non-GAAP EPS of $0.98. Non-GAAP gross margins were 60.2% and our non-GAAP operating expenses were $248 million, slightly below our guidance due to slower-than-planned hiring. Non-GAAP operating profit rate was 27.4%. We had no 10% customers in the quarter. The tax rate, excluding discrete items for the quarter was 16% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Please note, you should now use this for the full year tax rate as well.  Looking at the results from a business unit perspective. Semi Test revenue of $482 million was down 9% from Q1 '21 as expected. SOC revenue was $387 million driven by strength in mobility and compute end markets. Memory revenue was $96 million, driven by flash final test and DRAM wafer sort. System Test group had revenue of $119 million, which was down 11% year-over-year, again, as expected. Storage Test sales, including HDD and system-level test solutions were $68 million in the quarter, down from $95 million in Q1 '21. Defense and aerospace and production board test grew year-on-year. At LitePoint, revenue of $52 million was up 26% from prior year due primarily to strong shipments of WiFi and UWB test systems.  Looking at our test portfolio overall. The positive demand environment, Mark noted, reinforces the trend line growth built into our 2024 earnings model. In Semi Test, growing device complexity supported by no transitions and unit growth will provide a long-term tailwind to that business. At LifePoint and in System Test, similar increases in complexity continue to drive growth.  A couple of examples. One, LitePoint revenue in 2021 was approximately double the 2017 level. Two, our Storage Test business. Revenue in Storage Test has more than quadrupled from 2017 to 2021. At LitePoint, we expect growth to continue to be driven by more complex wireless standards for connectivity, sophisticated location tracking and security technologies and cellular applications. In Storage Test, growing chip complexity combined with higher density, hard disk drives are driving long-term growth.  Now to Industrial Automation. Industrial Automation revenue of $103 million was up 29% year-over-year. This was ahead of what we planned in our Q1 guidance as we were able to work through several supply line constraints in the quarter at UR. I'll also note that we expect IA revenue to follow the historical pattern and grow as we move through the year.  UR sales were $85 million in Q1, up 30% and year-over-year with the highest growth in North America. MiR sales were $17 million, up 22% from Q1 '21. As Mark noted, higher payload products with higher ASPs contributed to that growth, and we expect this trend to continue.  Overall demand at both UR and MiR remained strong as labor availability and rising costs make the financial case for our human scale automation compelling. But as noted, we are watching for the impacts of COVID events in China and the Russian-Ukraine war closely.  From a financial perspective in IA, the group was breakeven on a non-GAAP operating basis in the first quarter. And for the full year, we expect to operate in the 5% to 15% range we discussed in past calls, with 2022 trending towards the low end of the range. Recall in 2021, IA delivered a 4% non-GAAP operating profit for the full year.  As noted in the past, with market penetration for cobots and AMRs below 3% and high market growth, our strategy is to prioritize growth over obtaining model profits. Simply put, we are investing to capture these markets as we see significant growth beyond the midterm.  Shifting to supply. While the demand environment is strong, supply issues are getting progressively worse. We continue to manage through a very challenging supply environment as we have for the past 2 years. Our supply management operations teams and partners have done an incredible job, including navigating through a multi-week plant shutdown at one of our major contract manufacturers in Q1. Fortunately, it was mid-quarter, and we had time to recover. Had the shutdown happened later in the quarter, the recovery could have shifted into the following quarter. It highlights the risk which will persist during the global COVID pandemic.  In Q2, there is more demand to ship if we could align supply. Issues range from chip shortages to COVID-related delivery shutdowns. We're taking numerous actions to harden our supply chain, including expanding our production operations geographically, adding new geographically diverse suppliers, redesigning products to use available components and many other actions. However, even with these actions, we expect supply line constraints to remain an issue through at least the first half of 2023.  Shifting to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our cash and marketable securities at the end of the quarter totaled $1.2 billion. We had $37 million in negative free cash flow in the quarter. Cash burn in the first quarter is typical for us as we pay variable compensation and profit sharing in the quarter. We spent $201 million and $18 million on buybacks and dividends, respectively, in Q1. As noted in January, we expect to purchase a minimum of $750 million -- sorry, $750 million of shares in 2022.  Regarding debt. To date, $384 million of convertible bonds have early converted in Q1. We paid $21 million to bondholders in the quarter. Now to our outlook for Q2. As you've heard this morning, customer demand is strong in all parts of the business. Our guidance range is wider than normal as number of material shortages continues to expand. And while we've been successful to date in addressing these issues, the margin for error continues to narrow, and the guidance assumes we won't see extended shutdowns of our production facilities due to COVID.  With that said, sales in Q2 are expected to be between $780 million and $870 million, with non-GAAP EPS in a range of $1 to $1.29 on 170 million diluted shares. The second quarter guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles. Second quarter gross margins are estimated at 60% to 61%. OpEx is expected to run at 31% to 34% of second quarter sales. The non-GAAP operating profit rate at the midpoint of the second quarter guidance is 28%.  Turning to the impact of inflation on our P&L. First, gross margins. We are seeing increased costs primarily in components and labor, both internally and at our partners. We're mitigating those increases through a variety of measures, including product pricing, operational efficiencies, multi-sourcing and seeing the benefit of our prior investments to reduce our bill of materials.  Our gross margin performance in Q1 and outlook for Q2 reflects our success to date with these measures. But I remind you, this is a very dynamic environment. On the OpEx front, we have planned for increased costs tied to inflation and we still plan on growing OpEx 11% to 13% over 2021 as noted in January.  Looking at our revenue profile for the year. The first half is shaping up a little bit better than expected with very tight supply. The second half is looking to be slightly up versus last year's second half, reasonably consistent with our expectations at the beginning of the year, even though test demand is incrementally higher. Supply issues may push some of that incremental demand into 2023.  We expect third quarter revenues will grow high single digits from the Q2 level and Q4 will grow sequentially as well. Our current view is that the first half revenues will be 46% to 47% and second half revenues will be 53% to 54%.  To sum up, demand across the company remains strong and growing supply constraints are moderating our shipments more than at any other time since the pandemic began. We're expanding our playbook to address these issues, but it's a very dynamic playing field and we're calling a lot of audibles along the way.  Our global teams in go-to-market operations, engineering and support functions continue to execute and collaborate in a challenging and dynamic environment to meet customer demand and deliver shareholder value. The passion is enjoyable to observe. Well done, team.  With that, I'll turn things back to Andy.\nAndrew Blanchard: Thanks, Sanjay. Chris, we'd now like to take some questions. And as a reminder, please let me yourself to one question and a follow-up.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from C.J. Muse of Evercore.\nChristopher Muse: I guess first question, regarding your largest customer heading into 2023, and obviously, that's a long time from now. But curious, as you think about the move to 3-nanometer, how are you thinking about test demand as it relates to units versus complexity? And I guess the worry in the marketplace is that the adoption of 3 could be spread out over 2 years as opposed to 1, and that would reduce kind of the demand for testers from you guys. So would love to hear how you're thinking about that. And obviously, the caveat is it's very early to have a great view there.\nMark Jagiela: Yes, C.J., it's really early on that. But first of all, I think there's two parts of your question. I think overall, we're looking at 3-nanometer in 2023 as mostly a complexity growth equation versus a unit growth driver in the cellphone device arena.  I think the other part of your question is, well, what is the adoption is partial for 3 nanometer. Certain devices go to 3 and other ones sort of lag. I think that is something we've seen before in iPads and other kinds of products in the market where they bifurcate migration.  If and when that ever occurs, there could be a 1-year depressed demand for test. But then in subsequent years, those sort of bifurcated product lines kind of then move in lockstep again north, maybe one's waterfall back a year, but the complexity growth resumes thereafter. So it's all hypothetical, but something like that would have an impact.\nChristopher Muse: Very helpful. I guess for my second question, just trying to think through your kind of stronger second half versus first half. And obviously, the robotics piece is helping on that. But this is the first time I think I've ever seen you guys have kind of a stronger outlook for Semi Test. Into the back half, we're normally -- Q2 is seasonally is your strongest quarter. So is that all a factor of supply constraints? Or are there other drivers to that change in trend?\nMark Jagiela: Well, there's three things going on there. The biggest thing -- Q2 is usually large because our largest customer has a big tooling peak in 2Q and 3Q. So that's absent. But the other thing is that the visibility is a bit longer now with lead times out. Customers are ordering a little bit in advance for capacity. So we do see or of what's to come towards the back end of this year and early '23. And it sort of aligns to this complexity growth related to new nodes that we're seeing.  So I think this year is a little unique in that absent the mobility bubble we usually see in the summer and adding in the move towards this node transition next year, we get this more linear ramp through the year of demand.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini of SFG.\nMehdi Hosseini: I want to go back to your outlook, especially looking into next year, and you made a reference to WFE, which is very positive, given all the investment this year. But it also appears that the investment for trailing edge is growing much faster and particularly a higher level of investment in China. What I want to ask you is how are you positioned in China, especially for with OSAT houses? And is there any incremental opportunity for share gain? And I have a follow-up.\nMark Jagiela: Yes. I think in China, we're positioned very well in legacy nonleading edge. The one place in China, we're not positioned well is with Huawei and the Huawei associated companies, which tends to -- are trying to skew as best they can toward more leading-edge positions.  But to the extent China will continue to grow on trailing edge -- but overall, our share of, let's say, the non-Huawei part of China is roughly the same as it is outside of China. So it's not a balloon or an anchor, so to speak. We're kind of going to float up and down there, I think, with investment and demand.\nMehdi Hosseini: Okay. So nothing really out of ordinary. If they are indeed investing more, it should trickle down to the back end and you as 1 of the 2. Okay.  And then moving on to Industrial Automation. And thanks for color on ADAS incremental opportunity. But it also seems to me that in order for you to fully realize the synergies between your Semi Test and Industrial Automation for EV and ADAS application, you would need to have more of a software content. And I'm just curious if I'm thinking about this the right way? And whether you would have to go to the market and acquire software IP so that you can have a more comprehensive portfolio for these growth the end markets?\nMark Jagiela: No, I don't see that, Mehdi. I think where we are positioned now, we're completely aligned to the technology trends in EV and ADAS and everything else there. So no, I don't see the need for that.\nOperator: And next, we have Timothy Arcuri of UBS.\nTimothy Arcuri: So Mark, you were saying that the SOC TAM is trending toward the high end of the $4.6 billion to $5 billion. I'm just wondering if you can give us some idea of sort of what end market's driving that the high end? I think last quarter, you gave us some breakdown. Compute, you thought would be $1.3 billion. I think you saw mobility would be $1.8 billion. Autos would be about $500 million. So can you just give us sort of what end market is driving that toward the high end? It sounds like autos might be a little better.\nSanjay Mehta: Sure. It's Sanjay here. I'll take that one. So we're seeing strength in -- incremental strength in compute and in auto that's driving us to the high end.\nTimothy Arcuri: Okay. And then I guess a question just around China. So are you seeing any impact or any pushouts or delays in shipment time lines from Chinese OSAT customers as a result of the lockdowns and maybe just as a result, also of weak demand in the consumer segment? So I mean, obviously, demand is still very strong if you look holistically. But if you look at the consumer markets and you look specifically in China, are you seeing any examples of customers delaying shipments of testers?\nMark Jagiela: No, we're not seeing any tester real meaningful delays at all yet in China. We have seen in Industrial Automation business, the robotics business, some slowdown in China. Sanjay referred to the Q1 performance there was a bit weak, and we're watching that. So that's more immediate. And as factories shutdown and things, we feel that. But I think on the test side, the headlights and the investments needed along the trend line are kind of obvious and compelling, and there's no yet any blips.\nOperator: And next, we have Brian Chin of Stifel.\nBrian Chin: I guess the first one focused on test. Given the supply challenges that you're discussing, do you think you're baking in enough conservatism on the '22 TAM outlook? And I ask in part because I think despite strong order rates, your competitor Advantest, they widened their 2022 TAM outlook, but at the lower, not higher end of the range. So kind of curious about that. . And also, beyond your largest customer with telegraphed last call, have you seen any incremental signs of capacity digestion in the broader SOC -- mobile SOC market?\nMark Jagiela: So just a quick comment from me first, and I'll let Sanjay talk a little more about it. I do think that compared to Advantest, we're in a very different supply chain situation. You look at their backlog out at almost a year. There's a very, I think, limited ability for them to see a road to incremental revenue in the year whereas we're months and less versus 1 year. And we do have capacity growth capability in the back half. So that's the difference, but I'll let Sanjay address the broader question.\nSanjay Mehta: Yes, I think overall, supply is getting tighter. As I've said on prior calls, I thought with substrate and fab capacity coming online in 2022, we'd be a little bit more in balance with supply and demand, but that hasn't been the case. As I said, our current view is that we see the tightening continuing into the first half of 2023. . And from an overall market perspective, we do believe that there is a constraining element of supply to meet the overall demand. And it's in the places where you'd expect in the semiconductor parts, FPGA linear logic, memory, other ASICs.\nBrian Chin: Got it. And then as I missed the part, I think I asked about whether you're seeing any signs of digestion in the broader SOC mobile market?\nMark Jagiela: No, not really. And I think the demand is still strong and the request for shipments are not pushing out. So I don't see any signs yet in test of sort of slacking demand.\nBrian Chin: Okay. Maybe just for my follow-up. In Industrial Automation, sorry if I missed this, but is sort of mid-30% plus still the bogey there in terms of growth rates? Obviously, talking about accelerated growth rates moving through the year. Improvements on our lead times, but also still some constraints, I think, was the discussion and also some -- want to see sort of how the pattern unfolds in China. So maybe can you discuss that and then also what that China exposure is? I think it's a fairly minority portion of the business, right?\nSanjay Mehta: Yes. So it's Sanjay here. So 35% plus is still our objective or our plan this year. It's progressing as we'd expect. I would say that, as Mark noted, China, which has traditionally been a very high-growth environment for IA, was slightly down year-on-year. And as Mark noted, we believe it's really tied to the plant shut down. So we're watching it very closely. . I would say on the supply front, a large -- a significant portion of that range increase is tied to supply. With UR, the range is approximately, let's say, $20 million, which is really a supply-driven range.  And then secondly, I'd say secondly, we are seeing supply from an IA perspective, lead times -- or sorry, our backlog will still be -- we expect it to be between 4 to 6 weeks as opposed to our objective of 1 to 2 weeks to keep it a fast turns business.\nMark Jagiela: So I do think the China piece is roughly 10% of our overall IA business. So it is flatlined in Q1 kind of on growth. But part of how we get to 35 plus through the back end of the year is assuming some of this COVID stuff goes away in China and in Q3 and -- we're presuming it persists through second quarter. But Q3 and Q4, it goes away.\nBrian Chin: Okay. That's fair.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Atif Malik of Citi.\nAtif Malik: Mark, you talked about weakness in the DRAM market. If you can just provide some more color. Is this because of DDR5 adoption pushed out because of the supply rapid delay? Or are you seeing something more?\nMark Jagiela: No, it's exactly that. DDR5 is moving slower than planned. It kind of server Sapphire Rapids delay. Nothing fundamental. The three elements of the memory market between DRAM wafer test final test and then flash wafer test final test kind of are 1/4, 1/4, 1/4 each of the total $1 billion TAM. There is a bit more tooling this year for DRAM wafer test, but that's nothing -- I think that's noise, not signal. And as I mentioned, we're seeing some strengthening in the flash side that's sort of making up more than the difference on the DDR5 weakness. The other thing about memory that's very encouraging for us is that we've talked about our market share being about 40%, low 40s globally there. In China, which is still investing heavily and growing quite rapidly in memory, it's moving closer to the high 50s. So we've got some good potential here with DDR5 hopefully coming back next year with Sapphire Rapids and the continued investments going into China.\nAtif Malik: Great. And as my follow-up, I want to go back to C.J.'s question earlier about the mobile compute adoption spread maybe over -- in a couple of years. That phone maker has publicly talked about facing physical limitations in creating a larger die to accommodate more transistors at 5-nanometer, which I don't believe was the driver in iPad-type decisions historically. So I mean, is it fair to assume that device maker could adopt 3-nanometer more widely moving forward given the limitations on the die side?\nMark Jagiela: Yes, I think that's more likely. It was a hypothetical question, I think, that C.J. was asking. But I do think -- so just to walk it back a little bit. This year, we've seen a slackening demand in tester demand because the complexity growth is low in phone silicon, highly correlated with the fact that we're kind of in our third year of 5-nanometer production. And yes, you just can't afford to grow the die size. It doesn't make economic sense to grow the die size. And absent that, it's hard to get more transistors unless you do a node transition.  So there's a bit of a backlog and a pent-up demand to get to this next turn of the screw, the next node of 3 nanometer. So this all depends kind of on the yields of what 3-nanometer is going to look like. But on the other side of the argument, you could see a larger portfolio of devices driving to move to 3-nanometer next year and people will be competing for fab capacity if the yields prove to be good. And I think you want to be positioned with the customers who are in the front of the line on that fab capacity, which I hope we are. I think we are. But I would subscribe more to the fact that people are -- there's a pent-up demand, and it could swing the other way.\nOperator: And next, we have Vivek Arya of Bank of America.\nVivek Arya: I just wanted to revisit this notion of the supply situation getting tighter. How do we reconcile that with your forecast of growing high single digit in Q2, Q3 and Q4 if the supply situation is getting tighter, how are you able to grow faster?\nSanjay Mehta: Well, we've been planning for it. I think a couple of things. We've been investing in multi-sourcing of components, geographically diversing. We've been building capacity really tied to our plans that we published with our earnings model. And you can see by our balance sheet, we're building inventory. So fundamentally, we're planning for it, and we're looking to execute.\nMark Jagiela: And the other thing we've been doing is some redesigns to remove some of the bottleneck parts. And as those redesign sort of flow into the shipment stream in the second half of the year, that gives us some incremental flexibility. So it's usually -- it's a few critical parts that bottleneck us that go through mad scrambles, negotiations, phone calls and things to try to unlock some supply from the suppliers during the course of the quarter. And we've been largely successful for the past 2 years doing that. We're still able to grow here in Q2, doing that. It's just that the likely outcome is more and more sort of constraints on the top end of what we might otherwise be able to ship. So for example, in the second quarter, Sanjay, roughly how much revenue and test are we thinking we've bottlenecked because of the line of sight we have on supply?\nSanjay Mehta: Yes. So in test, I'd say it's in the $40 million range. And I'd say in IA, it's in the $10 million range. And that is outside of our high end of our range, which is really unprecedented for us.\nMark Jagiela: Right. So that gives you some flavor of the magnitude. And that test in the past quarters might have been $10 million kind of numbers, small, but it's going from $10 million to $40 million, that's significant. And we look out in Q3 and Q4, it's judgment still, but we still think everything that Sanjay says we've done positions us to grow with reasonable performance on clearing some of these critical parts and anticipating this constrained environment persisting and getting a little bit worse.\nVivek Arya: Very helpful. And then for my follow-up, Mark, I wanted to revisit this content growth argument when you move from one node to another. So a few questions on that. First, could you give us a range of how much your average content grew in prior cycles and mobile SOCs when your customer moved from one generation to another? Was it 10% to 15%? 15% to 20%? If you could just give us some sense of what that range has been historically.  And the other thing I'm curious about is that will this require brand-new testers? Or can part of the deployed base be upgraded? Just how much incremental is this move to 3 nanometer so we're not surprised when it happens next year?\nMark Jagiela: I'm not sure what you mean by the content growth. So just clarify that for a minute.\nVivek Arya: Sure. So how does one quantify complexity, right, that if your average tester per unit of that smartphone is x when that SOC moves from 5 to 3, then how much extra tester revenue can you get from that for the same number of units?\nMark Jagiela: Yes. So the -- first of all, that second part of your question, which was reuse of testers. Testers are absolutely reused node to node, generation to generation. And testers we put in 10 years ago are still being used for mobile device testing. So long, long product lives. They do need to be upgraded a bit now and then. That's part of the flow, but there's no obsolescence event coming in the short term around testers. That's not in our midterm plan and anything else and hasn't been in the past.  So the node transitions typically enable transistor count bumps, and that's what drives incremental test capacity because you -- the same device requires more test time. And so I think you could expect something in the rough jump of 30%, 40% jump in transistor counts; drive, maybe a 20% jump in tester capacity. So you've got to do the math across the whole installed base of testers and everything else. So I haven't recently sat down and tried to pencil that out, so I can't sort of do it off the top of my head, but that's roughly the ratio is that what a node transition will give us is that big jump in transistor count.  And then you can say, okay, just to take an example, if the installed base of testers is 100, and there's no unit growth, all there is a node transition of about a 30% to 40% complexity bump, you would need 20 more testers to cover that in that year. The model is much more complex than that, of course. You'd have to sort of do it over years and model it. But that's the tips of the waves on it.\nOperator: And next, we have Krish Sankar of Cowen.\nKrish Sankar: I have two of them. Mark, thanks for the color on the industry market sizes. Given that the incremental strength in SOC is coming from auto, and memory is kind of more -- towards NAND versus DRAM, is it fair to still assume that your market share in SOC and memory is going to be about 40% this year? Or do you think SOC may be slightly higher, memory slightly lower? Then I have a follow-up.\nMark Jagiela: Yes. I think for the year, memory is probably still around 40, plus or minus 1% or so, but around 40. I don't think it changes significantly with this flash shift.  In the case of -- I wouldn't characterize it as much of a change. It's also probably slightly short of 40 for the year. And it will kind of depend on what happens in the supply chain issues as we get into Q4. I anticipate we'll be -- and we anticipate in our discussion here that we're going to be bottlenecked. The 30 -- $40-ish million were bottlenecked here in Q2 will likely grow as we get toward Q4. And if that, in fact, happens, then we'll probably be 38% to 39% share. If we can unconstrain that, we can ship more testers off, it could be in the 40% range.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Got it. And then you kind of spoke about the 3-nanometer from a large customer next year. Historically, there's been a little bit of a headwind to gross margin when they spend. I'm just kind of curious, should that be worse or similar to historical trends, if next year auto test flows and the tailwind you have this year from the Eagle test high-margin testers moderate as your large customer becomes a bigger portion in 2023?\nSanjay Mehta: Yes. It's Sanjay. So I think it's a good observation that the mobility, we'll call it the bubble. If we see that in 2023 on a margin percentage, it will have an impact. But I will say that we are having investments that continually work to both add supply assurance, but also -- and give us flexibility but also drives from a bill of materials. And we've been fighting the cost or the component inflation. But we plan to execute in our at our earnings model level of 59% to 60% would be our expectation.\nOperator: Up next, we have Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs.\nToshiya Hari: I had two as well. Mark, you talked about the hyperscale opportunity in your prepared remarks. I think you noted that some of the customer activity seems to be accelerating and that you've been pleased with your run rate. I was hoping you could elaborate on that a little bit and to the extent possible, kind of speak to the timing of a potential inflection in that business. I realize that's sort of a medium- to long-term opportunity for you. But curious to hear any new developments there?\nMark Jagiela: Yes, that's -- it's tough to speculate because there's two classes of hyperscaler silicon development that are going on. There's a class of development around new consumer products. That one is incredibly difficult for us to forecast because it's unprecedented-type product introductions to see if the market will develop or will they even be introduced. So to me, those -- they're active, we're highly engaged, they're wildcards.  Then there's another class that I would say is more compute, cloud infrastructure. Chips going into the cloud for specialized. Could be AI applications going into the edge. Those are a little more, I would say, have precedented applications, and we have long-term sort of plans. And those, I expect are going to start ramping next year. I think some of these are going to ramp.  Now how material will they be? I think we're still talking from a tester point of view, tens of millions versus hundreds of millions of dollars of incremental revenue. So we're still going to be early innings, but that gives you some sense.\nToshiya Hari: Got it. That's helpful. And then as a quick follow-up, maybe one for Sanjay. You guys seem to be executing really well from a gross margin perspective despite everything that's going on. I think you beat the midpoint of your guidance in Q1 by more than 100 basis points. You're guiding to another higher than 60% quarter for Q2 despite everything that's going on. So I guess the question is, is this primarily a function of your largest customer being absent or at least being a small percentage of your revenue than typical in that driving a better mix? Or are there -- I know you guys are working on a bunch of things. Is there anything sustainable that could drive margins above your long-term model?\nSanjay Mehta: Yes. So in Q1, it was really a function of product mix and really operational efficiencies and execution that drove us beyond what we guided in Q2 and beyond. Fundamentally, we were growing IA; LitePoint is growing, as examples. And in 2022, we see those businesses having higher than corporate average margins. I do believe that as we continue to work -- we have plans and we're working towards margin plans that are accretive. But let me remind you that there's been significant inflation and component costs and labor are increasing. So we feel like we manage the business to a 59% to 60% gross margin over the midterm. We have internal plans that are challenging those to make them higher, but we're also realistic about some of the headwinds in play in the environment.\nOperator: And we have Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley.\nJoseph Moore: In terms of the supply constraints that you have, can you kind of frame that competitively? I feel like last year, you had sort of a better supply situation than Advantest did? Is that still the case? And any ramifications for market share in the more transactional parts of the business?\nMark Jagiela: Well, we're not inside Advantest to know a lot. But what we do know from the outside is their backlog's close to a year. Their customers are forced to order in advance around a year. And so yes, apparently, whatever is going on in terms of supply chain strategy, it's been slightly more favorable on our side.  But we've worked this since 2019, 2018, sort of -- as a sort of a business continuity planning exercise around a whole series of things that could have gone wrong in the world, we never anticipated COVID but generally built up inventory resilience and backups that have fared well for us for 2 years.  So it kind of -- we've been hoping we would get through all of this without any significant bottlenecks. And we're seeing our first sort of headwind here in test at about a $40 million bottleneck in Q2. So 5% of our revenue roughly. We might have been able to increase revenue 5%.  And maybe that's going to be about the percentage through the year that we're going to be bottlenecked. We hope that we can keep it at that, keep lead times in sort of a 6-month range in test. And incrementally, get some of Advantest customers to consider us as a more responsive supplier. We'll see.\nOperator: And next, we have Sidney Ho of Deutsche Bank.\nSidney Ho: Just one question for me. Related to your largest customer, are you still expecting them to be a 10% revenue this year? And given normally, you have some good visibility into them in about this time April, June -- April, May time frame. Is there much variability for the rest of this year?\nSanjay Mehta: Yes. Sidney, it's Sanjay. Thanks for that question. So right now, our expectation is that we will not have that large customer be over 10%, consistent with what we thought in January.\nMark Jagiela: And I think on the, is there anything for the rest of the year? I think for 2Q and 3Q, no, it's pretty locked in. 4Q, frankly, is a wildcard because that in past years has been a surprise for us. It depends on sort of the ramp in 2022, the early silicon prove-outs and all kinds of factors and other products that might be launching. So fourth quarter is kind of still opaque to us. So I would say that if there's a potential for something in fourth quarter that we might not see yet, yes. But we'll be somewhat constrained there too, based on the earlier supply discussions.\nOperator: And I see no further questions in the queue. I will turn the conference back over to Mr. Blanchard. Sir, you may continue.\nAndrew Blanchard: Well, for the first time in over 40 quarters, we're finished in early. Thanks, everybody, for joining us. Look forward to talking to you in the days and weeks ahead. Bye, bye. .\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect, and have a pleasant day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark Jagiela",
            "content": "Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, I'll summarize our Q1 results, review current market conditions, and provide an update on Q2 and the full year. Sanjay will then take you through the financial details, including our outlook for the second quarter.  The first quarter played out as expected from a financial perspective. We delivered results toward the high end of guidance as we cleared a few more supply chain bottlenecks than expected.  As outlined in January, we expect revenue growth throughout the year as we build toward 2023 and the transition to 3-nanometer. Consequently, we expect roughly 7% to 9% sequential quarter-over-quarter growth throughout the year.  Since January, we've seen incremental strengthening of demand for Semi Test and wireless in the areas of automotive, memory, WiFi 6c and 7. On the other hand, for the first time in 2 years, supply chain challenges are materially impacting our Semi Test shipments. This is reflected in our wider-than-normal revenue guidance range in Q2. Sanjay will describe these details shortly.  From a full year market perspective, we estimate the SOC market is trending to the high end of the $4.6 billion to $5 billion range we discussed in January. Strengthening automotive test demand is one element driving the market increase as both per car content and unit complexity are growing quickly. The accelerating move to electric vehicles is a key part of this increase with EVs growing at a 20% plus CAGR while the chip content of these vehicles is running more than 3x compared to gas-powered cars.  This year, we are seeing particular strength emerging in high-end automotive ADAS processes. Complexity of these processes is approaching the level of high-end cellphone applications processors. Additionally, high-end ADAS processors have about a 3 to 4x longer test time due to the more stringent test requirements for devices used in automotive safety applications. Furthermore, there are usually multiple ADAS processors per vehicle, amplifying the unit demand. Combining the enhanced EV semiconductor content with these ADAS trends, we expect the automotive test market to outgrow the core test market for the receivable future.  Another area of growth is in hyperscaler silicon development. While the material test revenue impact from these complex chips is in 2023 and beyond, both the complexity and pace of development is accelerating. This has been a focused investment area for us over the last 18 months, and we are pleased with our win work -- sorry, pleased with our win rate for these new opportunities.  Shifting to the memory test market. Our market size estimate for the year remains at about $1 billion. But within that, we have seen the DRAM demand soften a bit, offset by an increase in flash demand.  In System Test, defense and aerospace and production board test groups collectively grew over 30% from Q1 '21 on strong automotive board test demand and program buying in defense and aerospace.  In Storage Test, sales were down 28% as expected versus 1Q of '21. Customer concentration here causes this lumpiness, but the long-term complexity and unit demand drivers remain in place.  Our wireless test business at LitePoint remains very healthy with sales growing 26% year-over-year in Q1. Strong demand for emerging WiFi 6c and WiFi 7 standards is driving this growth and the outlook for the year.  LifePoint's strategy delivers high throughput, easy-to-deploy test solutions for the full array of wireless standards. Our chipset test library approach to programming allows customers to shorten their time to market and achieve superior test economics for these emerging standards.  Moving to Industrial Automation. Group revenues were up 29% from Q1 of last year. Demand in North America was particularly strong with 55% growth year-over-year. While we cleared some supply issues at UR rate in the quarter, IA shipments overall continue to be constrained by material shortages.  Globally, the PMIs for the U.S. and Europe remain over 50, while in China, the PMI dipped below 50 in March. We are closely watching to confirm that China data point is a short-term COVID lockdown issue and anticipate recovery in 3Q and 4Q.  Similarly, the conflict in Ukraine slowed EU demand in March and has the potential to impact the European industrial activity throughout the year. While we expect these constraints to continue in 2Q, we do expect IA growth rates to increase through the year as supply constraints ease, AutoGuide begins to ramp shipments and UR and MiR see increased growth on China and EU recovery.  At UR, our OEM welding application continued on a tear with 1Q growth of over 100% compared to 1 year ago. The U.S. geography was also strong with over 50% year-over-year growth. Our UR+ program of plug-and-play applications for our cobots is passing in the 400-product milestone this quarter. Each of these applications leverages an independent third-party developers knowledge of a specific market vertical to solve a specific problem. This application is then certified by UR so our customers can deploy automation solutions quickly by spending less time on programming and integration work. The resulting network effect is a powerful differentiator for us, and we continue to invest to support this growing army of developers.  At MiR, we are seeing two positive trends emerge as we grow the business. First, we are seeing a steady movement toward higher payload, higher ASP AMRs. In 2020, about 10% of our sales were above the 500-kilogram payload range. This moved to 22% in 2021. And in Q1, we saw over 30% of our sales in this class. This represents a broadening of AMR applications to a wider range of material handling tests and manufacturing and logistics.  Second, we are seeing the trend toward both growing fleet sizes and increasing multifactory deployments at major customers. Within these environments, our fleet management software is an increasingly important product differentiator. These larger customers also have demand the uptime and support requirements, which also plays to our strength as MiR is leveraging Teradyne's global support and large account experience to meet these customers' needs in ways that smaller players can't.  With one quarter of 2022 in the books, the year is unfolding roughly in line with our forecast. The incrementally stronger demand in test is being balanced by supply constraints. Longer term, I am encouraged by the continued strength in WFE investments, which fuels our growth; the progress from industry leaders on 3-nanometer technology; the growing opportunity for our human scale automation projects and the resilience of Teradyne's global team and our partners that are enabling us to muscle through some very tough supply and operational constraints.  And before closing, I want to note an important milestone at Teradyne. Mike Bradley will retire from our Board of Directors in May. Mike's Teradyne career spans over 40 years, including 10 years as CEO, helping shape Teradyne's products, business model and culture. Mike has had an incredible impact on our company, our customers and shareholders, and I'm especially appreciative for the help he's given me along the way. Thanks, Mike.  Sanjay will now take you through the financial details. Sanjay? Yes, C.J., it's really early on that. But first of all, I think there's two parts of your question. I think overall, we're looking at 3-nanometer in 2023 as mostly a complexity growth equation versus a unit growth driver in the cellphone device arena.  I think the other part of your question is, well, what is the adoption is partial for 3 nanometer. Certain devices go to 3 and other ones sort of lag. I think that is something we've seen before in iPads and other kinds of products in the market where they bifurcate migration.  If and when that ever occurs, there could be a 1-year depressed demand for test. But then in subsequent years, those sort of bifurcated product lines kind of then move in lockstep again north, maybe one's waterfall back a year, but the complexity growth resumes thereafter. So it's all hypothetical, but something like that would have an impact. Well, there's three things going on there. The biggest thing -- Q2 is usually large because our largest customer has a big tooling peak in 2Q and 3Q. So that's absent. But the other thing is that the visibility is a bit longer now with lead times out. Customers are ordering a little bit in advance for capacity. So we do see or of what's to come towards the back end of this year and early '23. And it sort of aligns to this complexity growth related to new nodes that we're seeing.  So I think this year is a little unique in that absent the mobility bubble we usually see in the summer and adding in the move towards this node transition next year, we get this more linear ramp through the year of demand. Yes. I think in China, we're positioned very well in legacy nonleading edge. The one place in China, we're not positioned well is with Huawei and the Huawei associated companies, which tends to -- are trying to skew as best they can toward more leading-edge positions.  But to the extent China will continue to grow on trailing edge -- but overall, our share of, let's say, the non-Huawei part of China is roughly the same as it is outside of China. So it's not a balloon or an anchor, so to speak. We're kind of going to float up and down there, I think, with investment and demand. No, I don't see that, Mehdi. I think where we are positioned now, we're completely aligned to the technology trends in EV and ADAS and everything else there. So no, I don't see the need for that. No, we're not seeing any tester real meaningful delays at all yet in China. We have seen in Industrial Automation business, the robotics business, some slowdown in China. Sanjay referred to the Q1 performance there was a bit weak, and we're watching that. So that's more immediate. And as factories shutdown and things, we feel that. But I think on the test side, the headlights and the investments needed along the trend line are kind of obvious and compelling, and there's no yet any blips. So just a quick comment from me first, and I'll let Sanjay talk a little more about it. I do think that compared to Advantest, we're in a very different supply chain situation. You look at their backlog out at almost a year. There's a very, I think, limited ability for them to see a road to incremental revenue in the year whereas we're months and less versus 1 year. And we do have capacity growth capability in the back half. So that's the difference, but I'll let Sanjay address the broader question. No, not really. And I think the demand is still strong and the request for shipments are not pushing out. So I don't see any signs yet in test of sort of slacking demand. So I do think the China piece is roughly 10% of our overall IA business. So it is flatlined in Q1 kind of on growth. But part of how we get to 35 plus through the back end of the year is assuming some of this COVID stuff goes away in China and in Q3 and -- we're presuming it persists through second quarter. But Q3 and Q4, it goes away. No, it's exactly that. DDR5 is moving slower than planned. It kind of server Sapphire Rapids delay. Nothing fundamental. The three elements of the memory market between DRAM wafer test final test and then flash wafer test final test kind of are 1/4, 1/4, 1/4 each of the total $1 billion TAM. There is a bit more tooling this year for DRAM wafer test, but that's nothing -- I think that's noise, not signal. And as I mentioned, we're seeing some strengthening in the flash side that's sort of making up more than the difference on the DDR5 weakness. The other thing about memory that's very encouraging for us is that we've talked about our market share being about 40%, low 40s globally there. In China, which is still investing heavily and growing quite rapidly in memory, it's moving closer to the high 50s. So we've got some good potential here with DDR5 hopefully coming back next year with Sapphire Rapids and the continued investments going into China. Yes, I think that's more likely. It was a hypothetical question, I think, that C.J. was asking. But I do think -- so just to walk it back a little bit. This year, we've seen a slackening demand in tester demand because the complexity growth is low in phone silicon, highly correlated with the fact that we're kind of in our third year of 5-nanometer production. And yes, you just can't afford to grow the die size. It doesn't make economic sense to grow the die size. And absent that, it's hard to get more transistors unless you do a node transition.  So there's a bit of a backlog and a pent-up demand to get to this next turn of the screw, the next node of 3 nanometer. So this all depends kind of on the yields of what 3-nanometer is going to look like. But on the other side of the argument, you could see a larger portfolio of devices driving to move to 3-nanometer next year and people will be competing for fab capacity if the yields prove to be good. And I think you want to be positioned with the customers who are in the front of the line on that fab capacity, which I hope we are. I think we are. But I would subscribe more to the fact that people are -- there's a pent-up demand, and it could swing the other way. And the other thing we've been doing is some redesigns to remove some of the bottleneck parts. And as those redesign sort of flow into the shipment stream in the second half of the year, that gives us some incremental flexibility. So it's usually -- it's a few critical parts that bottleneck us that go through mad scrambles, negotiations, phone calls and things to try to unlock some supply from the suppliers during the course of the quarter. And we've been largely successful for the past 2 years doing that. We're still able to grow here in Q2, doing that. It's just that the likely outcome is more and more sort of constraints on the top end of what we might otherwise be able to ship. So for example, in the second quarter, Sanjay, roughly how much revenue and test are we thinking we've bottlenecked because of the line of sight we have on supply? Right. So that gives you some flavor of the magnitude. And that test in the past quarters might have been $10 million kind of numbers, small, but it's going from $10 million to $40 million, that's significant. And we look out in Q3 and Q4, it's judgment still, but we still think everything that Sanjay says we've done positions us to grow with reasonable performance on clearing some of these critical parts and anticipating this constrained environment persisting and getting a little bit worse. I'm not sure what you mean by the content growth. So just clarify that for a minute. Yes. So the -- first of all, that second part of your question, which was reuse of testers. Testers are absolutely reused node to node, generation to generation. And testers we put in 10 years ago are still being used for mobile device testing. So long, long product lives. They do need to be upgraded a bit now and then. That's part of the flow, but there's no obsolescence event coming in the short term around testers. That's not in our midterm plan and anything else and hasn't been in the past.  So the node transitions typically enable transistor count bumps, and that's what drives incremental test capacity because you -- the same device requires more test time. And so I think you could expect something in the rough jump of 30%, 40% jump in transistor counts; drive, maybe a 20% jump in tester capacity. So you've got to do the math across the whole installed base of testers and everything else. So I haven't recently sat down and tried to pencil that out, so I can't sort of do it off the top of my head, but that's roughly the ratio is that what a node transition will give us is that big jump in transistor count.  And then you can say, okay, just to take an example, if the installed base of testers is 100, and there's no unit growth, all there is a node transition of about a 30% to 40% complexity bump, you would need 20 more testers to cover that in that year. The model is much more complex than that, of course. You'd have to sort of do it over years and model it. But that's the tips of the waves on it. Yes. I think for the year, memory is probably still around 40, plus or minus 1% or so, but around 40. I don't think it changes significantly with this flash shift.  In the case of -- I wouldn't characterize it as much of a change. It's also probably slightly short of 40 for the year. And it will kind of depend on what happens in the supply chain issues as we get into Q4. I anticipate we'll be -- and we anticipate in our discussion here that we're going to be bottlenecked. The 30 -- $40-ish million were bottlenecked here in Q2 will likely grow as we get toward Q4. And if that, in fact, happens, then we'll probably be 38% to 39% share. If we can unconstrain that, we can ship more testers off, it could be in the 40% range. Yes, that's -- it's tough to speculate because there's two classes of hyperscaler silicon development that are going on. There's a class of development around new consumer products. That one is incredibly difficult for us to forecast because it's unprecedented-type product introductions to see if the market will develop or will they even be introduced. So to me, those -- they're active, we're highly engaged, they're wildcards.  Then there's another class that I would say is more compute, cloud infrastructure. Chips going into the cloud for specialized. Could be AI applications going into the edge. Those are a little more, I would say, have precedented applications, and we have long-term sort of plans. And those, I expect are going to start ramping next year. I think some of these are going to ramp.  Now how material will they be? I think we're still talking from a tester point of view, tens of millions versus hundreds of millions of dollars of incremental revenue. So we're still going to be early innings, but that gives you some sense. Well, we're not inside Advantest to know a lot. But what we do know from the outside is their backlog's close to a year. Their customers are forced to order in advance around a year. And so yes, apparently, whatever is going on in terms of supply chain strategy, it's been slightly more favorable on our side.  But we've worked this since 2019, 2018, sort of -- as a sort of a business continuity planning exercise around a whole series of things that could have gone wrong in the world, we never anticipated COVID but generally built up inventory resilience and backups that have fared well for us for 2 years.  So it kind of -- we've been hoping we would get through all of this without any significant bottlenecks. And we're seeing our first sort of headwind here in test at about a $40 million bottleneck in Q2. So 5% of our revenue roughly. We might have been able to increase revenue 5%.  And maybe that's going to be about the percentage through the year that we're going to be bottlenecked. We hope that we can keep it at that, keep lead times in sort of a 6-month range in test. And incrementally, get some of Advantest customers to consider us as a more responsive supplier. We'll see. And I think on the, is there anything for the rest of the year? I think for 2Q and 3Q, no, it's pretty locked in. 4Q, frankly, is a wildcard because that in past years has been a surprise for us. It depends on sort of the ramp in 2022, the early silicon prove-outs and all kinds of factors and other products that might be launching. So fourth quarter is kind of still opaque to us. So I would say that if there's a potential for something in fourth quarter that we might not see yet, yes. But we'll be somewhat constrained there too, based on the earlier supply discussions."

            "name": "Sanjay Mehta",
            "content": "Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll provide details on our Q1 results, offer additional color on the operating environment, including the supply line update and describe our Q2 outlook.  Now to Q1. First quarter sales were $755 million, with non-GAAP EPS of $0.98. Non-GAAP gross margins were 60.2% and our non-GAAP operating expenses were $248 million, slightly below our guidance due to slower-than-planned hiring. Non-GAAP operating profit rate was 27.4%. We had no 10% customers in the quarter. The tax rate, excluding discrete items for the quarter was 16% on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Please note, you should now use this for the full year tax rate as well.  Looking at the results from a business unit perspective. Semi Test revenue of $482 million was down 9% from Q1 '21 as expected. SOC revenue was $387 million driven by strength in mobility and compute end markets. Memory revenue was $96 million, driven by flash final test and DRAM wafer sort. System Test group had revenue of $119 million, which was down 11% year-over-year, again, as expected. Storage Test sales, including HDD and system-level test solutions were $68 million in the quarter, down from $95 million in Q1 '21. Defense and aerospace and production board test grew year-on-year. At LitePoint, revenue of $52 million was up 26% from prior year due primarily to strong shipments of WiFi and UWB test systems.  Looking at our test portfolio overall. The positive demand environment, Mark noted, reinforces the trend line growth built into our 2024 earnings model. In Semi Test, growing device complexity supported by no transitions and unit growth will provide a long-term tailwind to that business. At LifePoint and in System Test, similar increases in complexity continue to drive growth.  A couple of examples. One, LitePoint revenue in 2021 was approximately double the 2017 level. Two, our Storage Test business. Revenue in Storage Test has more than quadrupled from 2017 to 2021. At LitePoint, we expect growth to continue to be driven by more complex wireless standards for connectivity, sophisticated location tracking and security technologies and cellular applications. In Storage Test, growing chip complexity combined with higher density, hard disk drives are driving long-term growth.  Now to Industrial Automation. Industrial Automation revenue of $103 million was up 29% year-over-year. This was ahead of what we planned in our Q1 guidance as we were able to work through several supply line constraints in the quarter at UR. I'll also note that we expect IA revenue to follow the historical pattern and grow as we move through the year.  UR sales were $85 million in Q1, up 30% and year-over-year with the highest growth in North America. MiR sales were $17 million, up 22% from Q1 '21. As Mark noted, higher payload products with higher ASPs contributed to that growth, and we expect this trend to continue.  Overall demand at both UR and MiR remained strong as labor availability and rising costs make the financial case for our human scale automation compelling. But as noted, we are watching for the impacts of COVID events in China and the Russian-Ukraine war closely.  From a financial perspective in IA, the group was breakeven on a non-GAAP operating basis in the first quarter. And for the full year, we expect to operate in the 5% to 15% range we discussed in past calls, with 2022 trending towards the low end of the range. Recall in 2021, IA delivered a 4% non-GAAP operating profit for the full year.  As noted in the past, with market penetration for cobots and AMRs below 3% and high market growth, our strategy is to prioritize growth over obtaining model profits. Simply put, we are investing to capture these markets as we see significant growth beyond the midterm.  Shifting to supply. While the demand environment is strong, supply issues are getting progressively worse. We continue to manage through a very challenging supply environment as we have for the past 2 years. Our supply management operations teams and partners have done an incredible job, including navigating through a multi-week plant shutdown at one of our major contract manufacturers in Q1. Fortunately, it was mid-quarter, and we had time to recover. Had the shutdown happened later in the quarter, the recovery could have shifted into the following quarter. It highlights the risk which will persist during the global COVID pandemic.  In Q2, there is more demand to ship if we could align supply. Issues range from chip shortages to COVID-related delivery shutdowns. We're taking numerous actions to harden our supply chain, including expanding our production operations geographically, adding new geographically diverse suppliers, redesigning products to use available components and many other actions. However, even with these actions, we expect supply line constraints to remain an issue through at least the first half of 2023.  Shifting to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our cash and marketable securities at the end of the quarter totaled $1.2 billion. We had $37 million in negative free cash flow in the quarter. Cash burn in the first quarter is typical for us as we pay variable compensation and profit sharing in the quarter. We spent $201 million and $18 million on buybacks and dividends, respectively, in Q1. As noted in January, we expect to purchase a minimum of $750 million -- sorry, $750 million of shares in 2022.  Regarding debt. To date, $384 million of convertible bonds have early converted in Q1. We paid $21 million to bondholders in the quarter. Now to our outlook for Q2. As you've heard this morning, customer demand is strong in all parts of the business. Our guidance range is wider than normal as number of material shortages continues to expand. And while we've been successful to date in addressing these issues, the margin for error continues to narrow, and the guidance assumes we won't see extended shutdowns of our production facilities due to COVID.  With that said, sales in Q2 are expected to be between $780 million and $870 million, with non-GAAP EPS in a range of $1 to $1.29 on 170 million diluted shares. The second quarter guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles. Second quarter gross margins are estimated at 60% to 61%. OpEx is expected to run at 31% to 34% of second quarter sales. The non-GAAP operating profit rate at the midpoint of the second quarter guidance is 28%.  Turning to the impact of inflation on our P&L. First, gross margins. We are seeing increased costs primarily in components and labor, both internally and at our partners. We're mitigating those increases through a variety of measures, including product pricing, operational efficiencies, multi-sourcing and seeing the benefit of our prior investments to reduce our bill of materials.  Our gross margin performance in Q1 and outlook for Q2 reflects our success to date with these measures. But I remind you, this is a very dynamic environment. On the OpEx front, we have planned for increased costs tied to inflation and we still plan on growing OpEx 11% to 13% over 2021 as noted in January.  Looking at our revenue profile for the year. The first half is shaping up a little bit better than expected with very tight supply. The second half is looking to be slightly up versus last year's second half, reasonably consistent with our expectations at the beginning of the year, even though test demand is incrementally higher. Supply issues may push some of that incremental demand into 2023.  We expect third quarter revenues will grow high single digits from the Q2 level and Q4 will grow sequentially as well. Our current view is that the first half revenues will be 46% to 47% and second half revenues will be 53% to 54%.  To sum up, demand across the company remains strong and growing supply constraints are moderating our shipments more than at any other time since the pandemic began. We're expanding our playbook to address these issues, but it's a very dynamic playing field and we're calling a lot of audibles along the way.  Our global teams in go-to-market operations, engineering and support functions continue to execute and collaborate in a challenging and dynamic environment to meet customer demand and deliver shareholder value. The passion is enjoyable to observe. Well done, team.  With that, I'll turn things back to Andy. Sure. It's Sanjay here. I'll take that one. So we're seeing strength in -- incremental strength in compute and in auto that's driving us to the high end. Yes, I think overall, supply is getting tighter. As I've said on prior calls, I thought with substrate and fab capacity coming online in 2022, we'd be a little bit more in balance with supply and demand, but that hasn't been the case. As I said, our current view is that we see the tightening continuing into the first half of 2023. . And from an overall market perspective, we do believe that there is a constraining element of supply to meet the overall demand. And it's in the places where you'd expect in the semiconductor parts, FPGA linear logic, memory, other ASICs. Yes. So it's Sanjay here. So 35% plus is still our objective or our plan this year. It's progressing as we'd expect. I would say that, as Mark noted, China, which has traditionally been a very high-growth environment for IA, was slightly down year-on-year. And as Mark noted, we believe it's really tied to the plant shut down. So we're watching it very closely. . I would say on the supply front, a large -- a significant portion of that range increase is tied to supply. With UR, the range is approximately, let's say, $20 million, which is really a supply-driven range.  And then secondly, I'd say secondly, we are seeing supply from an IA perspective, lead times -- or sorry, our backlog will still be -- we expect it to be between 4 to 6 weeks as opposed to our objective of 1 to 2 weeks to keep it a fast turns business. Well, we've been planning for it. I think a couple of things. We've been investing in multi-sourcing of components, geographically diversing. We've been building capacity really tied to our plans that we published with our earnings model. And you can see by our balance sheet, we're building inventory. So fundamentally, we're planning for it, and we're looking to execute. Yes. So in test, I'd say it's in the $40 million range. And I'd say in IA, it's in the $10 million range. And that is outside of our high end of our range, which is really unprecedented for us. Yes. It's Sanjay. So I think it's a good observation that the mobility, we'll call it the bubble. If we see that in 2023 on a margin percentage, it will have an impact. But I will say that we are having investments that continually work to both add supply assurance, but also -- and give us flexibility but also drives from a bill of materials. And we've been fighting the cost or the component inflation. But we plan to execute in our at our earnings model level of 59% to 60% would be our expectation. Yes. So in Q1, it was really a function of product mix and really operational efficiencies and execution that drove us beyond what we guided in Q2 and beyond. Fundamentally, we were growing IA; LitePoint is growing, as examples. And in 2022, we see those businesses having higher than corporate average margins. I do believe that as we continue to work -- we have plans and we're working towards margin plans that are accretive. But let me remind you that there's been significant inflation and component costs and labor are increasing. So we feel like we manage the business to a 59% to 60% gross margin over the midterm. We have internal plans that are challenging those to make them higher, but we're also realistic about some of the headwinds in play in the environment. Yes. Sidney, it's Sanjay. Thanks for that question. So right now, our expectation is that we will not have that large customer be over 10%, consistent with what we thought in January."

Now, let\u2019s get on with the rest of the agenda. First, Greg will comment on our recent results and the market conditions as we enter the new year. Sanjay will then offer more details on our quarterly results, along with our guidance for the first quarter. We\u2019ll then answer your questions and this call is scheduled for 1 hour. Greg?\nGreg Smith: Hello, everyone and thanks for joining us this morning. Today, I will summarize our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results, comment on our early view of 2024 and describe the market assumptions underpinning our updated midterm earnings model. Sanjay will then provide financial details on all of these topics. We delivered Q4 financial results in line with our guidance. The clear highlights for the quarter were the \u2013 were Memory Test, where DRAM tester revenue more than doubled from Q4 2022 on HBM demand and our Robotics team\u2019s execution in growing sales, 17% from Q4 2022 and 50% sequentially, as we ramp shipments to address the record backlog of our new UR20 Cobot at Universal Robots. Balancing these strengths in Memory and Robotics was continued softness in our other test markets. Shifting now to the full year, 2023 was the second consecutive year that the size of the semiconductor test market declined, as the industry digested record shipments in 2020 and 2021, driven by COVID-related demand. The SOC test market has declined 21% from 2021 and the mobility portion has contracted 55% over the same period. Most of that decline occurred in 2023, with SOC demand down 17% year-on-year. Mobility has historically been the largest sub-segment of the SOC market and an area of strength for us in semiconductor test and in wireless test. Despite the weakness in demand, the trend towards vertically integrated producers is continuing. This new class of customer provides an opportunity for Teradyne to gain share in high-performance computing, a segment where we have historically had low share. These customers will take time to ramp. And so we are focusing on capturing sockets. On that front, 2023 was a great year for us, capturing the majority of key VIP sockets, where we targeted at customers in the United States and in China. Although automotive was strong for most of 2023, at the end of the year, elevated inventories for our automotive customers began to slow down the rate at which they add test capacity. Our latest estimate of the Semi Test market for 2023 is about $4.8 billion, with $3.9 billion in SOC and $900 million in Memory Test. Our 2023 financial results reflected the test market weakness and when combined with a tepid robotics market, company sales were $2.676 billion, down about 15% and non-GAAP earnings of $2.93 were down 31% from 2022. As we enter 2024, let me describe how we are looking at the current market. Visibility is limited, but we are cautiously optimistic. In SOC test, chip inventories remain high and subcon tester utilization remains in the 70s. These combined to create a headwind to tester demand in the first half of 2024. The inventory overhang now extends to parts of the legacy automotive market, which began to soften late in Q4. With this softening of demand, lead times for our SOC testers are now back to pre-COVID levels, generally less than 16 weeks. This enables customers to wait to place new orders until their demand is certain, limiting our visibility. Our current view is that these headwinds will abate midyear and we are planning for a second \u2013 a stronger second half in SOC test. Several leading indicators point to a second half improvement. For example, we have seen no slowdown in chip development activity at our customers, so the product pipeline remains healthy. While still below normal seasonality, utilization levels are beginning to inch upwards, especially in the OSATs, which points towards improving mobility and compute demand. Mobile phones are expected to adopt AI capabilities in the premium tier in 2024 and more broadly in 2025, which should accelerate complexity and be a positive for test demand. Despite the slowdown we are seeing now in automotive demand, the key driver for this market is the increased electronics content per vehicle, not end vehicle sales. Automotive semi devices are forecast to grow an 11% CAGR through the mid-term and device \u2013 this and the vast complexity is increasing. Therefore, we expect this law will be short-lived. In Memory Test, the story for 2023 is that despite high end market inventories, demand for new testers was driven by the retooling required to test higher speed flash and DRAM devices especially HBM DRAM. This drove our memory share to a record 43% in 2023. In 2024, we expect continued Memory revenue growth driven by the volume production ramps of the technology introductions we saw in 2023 and continued R&D investments for even faster devices. As business conditions improve for Memory makers, this may drive increased demand to support capacity expansion. Shifting now to other test markets. Wireless test demand is expected to remain at current levels in 2024 due to weakness in the networking equipment demand and excess capacity in smartphone test. In System Test, we expect continued strength in Defense and Aerospace markets and expect modest growth in demand and production board test. We expect storage test will remain weak in 2024, due to excess test capacity in the HDD and SLT test markets. Having said that, in 2023, we added important new SLT customers in mobility and high-performance computing that are setting us up for mid-term growth. Shifting to Robotics. We had a very strong Q4 as our UR20 ramp continued and we launched the new UR30 late in the quarter. Looking at Robotics for the full year 2023. In addition to the good progress on the new product front, our channel transformation work continued nicely with our OEM sales growing nearly 10%, as we added more than 50 new OEM partners. We have also expanded the number of large accounts we manage directly from approximately 100 to over 250. We expect Q1 of 2024 to be down more than the normal seasonal dip, as the extraordinary Q4 shipments are digested. Thereafter, we expect quarterly year-on-year growth through the rest of 2024. Combining all these points and with the provisor that our view into the second half is limited, we are modeling 2024 company revenue to be roughly flat year-on-year with 44% in the first half and 56% in the second half. Within that, we expect lower test revenue in 2024, which reflects the sale of our DIS business, reducing our full year semiconductor test revenue by approximately $100 million. Excluding the effects of that sale, expected test revenue would have been about flat in a roughly flat market. In Semi Test, our early estimate of the SOC market size for 2024 is $3.6 billion to $4.2 billion. And our estimate for Memory is $1 billion to $1.1 billion, for a combined Semiconductor Test market at the midpoint of $4.95 billion. We expect Robotics will grow in the 10% to 20% range in 2024. Turning now to our mid-term models. Despite the longer-than-expected downturn in the Mobile Test market and the softness in Robotics and demand, we remain optimistic about the long-term potential of our test and robotics businesses. This is shown in the update to our mid-term earnings model. At the midpoint in 2026, we expect to deliver earnings per share at over 2x the 2023 level and a revenue growth of nearly 60%. As we have noted in past calls, the key drivers of that growth include process node advances to 3-nanometer, 2-nanometer, gate all around and backside power delivery. These are all on track or even accelerating and they enable higher transistor counts, higher complexity and that drives longer test times. Good progress in the emerging VIP space with key wins at design-in targets and high share at two of the three leading ASIC design houses, all of which drive future revenue. Advanced packaging, including chiplet technology, which requires higher test intensity at the wafer level, driving longer test times. Compelling applications of Edge AI for ADAS and smartphone co-pilots that are driving demand for more processing power, more memory and wider bandwidth communications. All of these factors accelerate test demand. There is an aggressive roadmap for increases in memory interface speeds in DRAM HBM, and Flash that will continue to drive technology-driven retooling in the Memory market. And finally, in Robotics, we are still at less than 5% market penetration. And we are confident that our channel strategy will unlock the long-term growth potential of this market. In addition, the application of AI is expanding the range of tasks that our robots can serve, while our new products will expand our served market and decrease the effort required for customers to automate. At the company level, compared to last year, our growth outlook has shifted to the right, but the slope of expected growth is largely unchanged. The duration of the downturn in mobile demand has been longer than we expected and the softness in the industrial automation market that we and our peers have seen has really impacted our expectations of growth in Robotics for 2023. Sanjay will provide more financial details of the model. As we look at our results for 2023 and the outlook for 2024, we are focused on improving gross margins and maintaining tight financial discipline, while making the necessary R&D and customer-facing investments required to capture the long-term growth potential in both the test and robotics markets. To maintain that financial discipline, we will be looking to see signs of top line growth before allowing OpEx to materially increase. We operate our business with mid-term plans that track long-term historical trends and the future demand drivers in each of our businesses rather than trying to predict short-term cycles. In any given year, results will land above or below that trend, but that trend line has provided a reliable baseline for planning. As expected, 2023 was below trend line, but the underlying demand drivers remain in place and we are executing our plans to capture that future demand. We are excited about the opportunities ahead and we have deep confidence in our team\u2019s ability to capture those opportunities. With that, I will turn things over to Sanjay. Sanjay?\nSanjay Mehta: Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone. Today, I\u2019ll cover the financial summary of Q4, the full year 2023, provide our Q1 outlook, some planning guidance for full year 2024, review our updated earnings model and outline our capital allocation plan. Now to Q4. Fourth quarter sales were $671 million, with non-GAAP EPS of $0.79, both in line with our guidance. Semi Test revenue of $431 million at SOC revenue of $327 million, with high memory shipments of $104 million, as Greg noted in his highlights. System Test group had revenue of $86 million, down 14% from Q4 \u201822. Growth in Defense and Aerospace was offset by weakness in storage test and production board test. LifePoint revenue of $25 million was weaker year-over-year due to continued weakness in cellular, PC markets. Robotics revenue of $129 million was up 17% from the fourth quarter of last year and up 50% sequentially on seasonally high demand and the impact of UR20 and UR30 new product shipments. Non-GAAP gross margin was 56.6% in the middle of our guidance range and non-GAAP operating expenses were $245 million in Q4, up $2 million from Q3 \u201823. Non-GAAP operating profit rate was 20.1%. Some other financial facts. We had one 10% customer in the quarter. Tax rate, excluding discrete items for the quarter was 12.6% on a non-GAAP basis and lower than planned because of geographic mix. GAAP tax rate was 14% in Q4, excluding discrete items. We repurchased $51 million of shares in the quarter. Turning to the full year results. We had revenue of $2.676 billion. Texas Instruments was the only customer greater 10% of our revenue for the year. Gross margin for the year was 57.4%. OpEx was $990 million and operating profit was 20.4%. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.93. We generated $426 million in free cash flow in 2023. We returned $468 million or 110% of free cash flow to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We ended the year with $937 million of cash and marketable securities. Our tax rate for the full year, excluding discrete items, was 15.5% on a non-GAAP basis and 15.25% on a GAAP basis. Semi Test revenue for the year was approximately $1.8 billion, with SOC revenue contributing $1.43 billion and Memory $386 million. Our SOC sales contracted 16% in 2023, in line with the continued mobility market weakness, partially offset by strength in auto and industrial. In Memory, our sales grew about 4%, driven by new technologies like UFS4 and Flash and LPDDR5 and HBM and DRAM. System Test group had revenue of $338 million in 2023. Combined Defense and Aerospace and production board test sales were both flat, while HDD and system-level test in our storage business were down in total nearly 50% from 2022. In Wireless Test, revenue of $144 million in 2023 was lower year-on-year, given the decline in handset units and continued weakness in the networking and PC markets. Now to Robotics. Robotics revenue in 2023 was $375 million, with UR contributing $304 million and MiR $71 million. The group had mid-teens profitability in Q4 \u201823, but for the full year, had an 8% non-GAAP operating loss. While UR was profitable in 2023, we continue to lean into R&D and channel enhancement investments in MiR. Now to our outlook for Q1. Since our October call, SOC test demand has softened, which impacts our Q1 outlook. Q1 sales are expected to be between $540 million and $590 million, with non-GAAP EPS in a range of $0.22 to $0.38 on 162 million diluted shares. The first quarter guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles. First quarter gross margins are expected to be the low point for the year and are estimated at 53.5% to 54.5%, due to lower volume and unfavorable product mix. OpEx is expected to be roughly flat with Q4 \u201823 and run at 42% to 46% of first quarter sales. Non-GAAP operating profit rate at the midpoint of our first quarter guidance is 10%. A few points to assist you in modeling 2024. First, the gross margin profile. In 2024, we expect gross margins to increase through the year. Gross margins are forecasted to improve to 58% to 59% for the full year driven by improved product mix, including the sale of the Device Interface Solutions or DIS business, lower business resiliency spending and operational improvements. Moving to the strategic partnership we announced with Technoprobe in November 2023. The agreement has several key components as follows: first, Technoprobe will purchase Teradyne\u2019s DIS business. This business provides advanced interfaces that connect our testers to customers\u2019 chips for test. Second, Teradyne will make an equity investment in Technoprobe, acquiring 10% of their outstanding shares. Third, Teradyne and Technoprobe will work together on a series of projects to expand the performance of semiconductor device interfaces, to enable customers to realize the full performance of our test systems. We expect the transactions to close in the second quarter. DIS had 2023 revenue of $103 million and the sales will reduce Teradyne\u2019s expected 2024 revenue by approximately $100 million, assuming the Q2 close date. It will not have a material impact on earnings. We plan to account for our investment in Technoprobe, using the equity accounting method. Regarding OpEx for the full year, we expect full year 2024 OpEx to increase 5% to 7%, driven by strategic projects to grow share in our Test businesses. The growth will be back half loaded. Robotics is expected to grow revenue 10% to 20% in 2024, enabling Robotics to be profitable. The group will have a similar revenue profile as a company with second half expected at 56% of full year revenue. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate is forecasted to be 16% in 2024, excluding discrete items. Turning to capital allocation. Our strategy remains consistent, as we take a balanced approach to maintain a minimum cash level of $800 million, which enables us to run the business, have cash reserves set aside in the event of a significant downturn and have dry powder for M&A. For reference, from 2015 to 2023, we\u2019ve returned over $4.3 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, which is 97% of our free cash flow. Earlier this month, we also announced a 9% increase in our dividend to $0.12 per quarter. We expect to close our investment in Technoprobe and our divestiture of DIS in Q2, which will consume an estimated $440 million of net cash. We will limit our share buybacks in 2024 to an amount necessary to offset dilution from equity compensation and our employee share purchase program in order to build cash back up to a minimum goal of $800 million. Therefore, we do not expect to materially reduce the share count in 2024. Moving to our mid-term earnings model. As we do each January, we\u2019ve updated our model. We share this with investors to provide insight into how we look at the markets we serve, our competitive positioning and ultimately, the growth and earnings power of the company. A few points for context. First, we\u2019ve kept 2026 as at year-end so you can make an easy comparison with last year\u2019s update. Second, financial ranges are down to reflect our revised view of the markets in which we participate. Greg outlined the key drivers for the Test portfolio, including device technology trends, complexity and unit growth, which we anticipate will drive ATE growth over the 3-year horizon. Our Test revenues are expected to grow at a CAGR of 12% to 18% from 2023\u2019s muted level to 2026, driven primarily by a recovery in Mobility Test demand. For Robotics, we\u2019re looking at a strong market opportunity. The drivers over the mid [Technical Difficulty] include labor shortages, new products and applications, including a growing range of AI-driven products and our channel transformation work. Our Robotics revenues are expected to grow at 20% to 30% CAGR from 2023 to 2026. The updated earnings model will drive 2026 revenue to approximately $4.3 billion and non-GAAP EPS to $6.50 at the midpoint of the model range. Our model at the midpoint, as a revenue CAGR from 2023 to 2026 of 17% and on EPS at 30%, highlighting the operating leverage of both Robotics and Test portfolios. Gross margin is estimated at 59% to 60%. OpEx as a percentage of sales will be 28% to 31%, yielding a non-GAAP operating margin of 28% to 32%. Summing up, we had a challenging year in 2023 and still delivered 20% operating profit on a non-GAAP basis. Generated $426 million in free cash flow and returned 110% of that cash to shareholders. We did this while we strengthened our competitive position in Test and Robotics with new products, invested in channel transformation and Robotics and announced a strategic partnership and Test Interfaces to drive Semi Test share growth. Looking ahead, we expect a return to growth later this year and beyond, driven by favorable trends in both Test and Robotics and the financial impact of that growth is reflected in our updated mid-term earnings model. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Andy. Andy?\nAndy Blanchard: Thanks, Sanjay. We\u2019d now like to take some questions. And as a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will be coming from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Please proceed with your questions.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one has to do with the midterm guide. It seems like there is about a 13% decline in your SOC TAM for 2026. What I want to better understand is how do you think about the mobile app processor and especially the transistor density versus a slow start in Industrial? How should we think about those two end markets impacting that 13% reduction to your 2026 TAM for SOC and I have a follow-up.\nGreg Smith: Hi, Mehdi, this is Greg. So the composition of the TAM in the mid-term model, if you compare this year to last year, I think the biggest change is that we think that the that the compute part of the market is going to be at a higher level, than we did last year. And we think that the mobile portion of the market is going to be up from where it is now but will not be at the level that we were modeling last year. So we believe that the pace of transistor density is proceeding basically at the same rate that we thought it was proceeding last year. The real difference is that the end market sort of end unit market predictions going out through the mid-term are a bit softer in this model than they were last time. And certainly, the impact of cloud and Edge AI in the market is a relatively new factor and is strengthening the compute part of it.\nMehdi Hosseini: Okay. Great. And the follow-up has to do with your prepared remarks. I believe you said you have a new compute customer. And if that\u2019s true, if I heard you correctly, how does the ramp of that new customer would look like? Is it more like a \u201825, \u201826 impact? And if you could just provide any additional color would be great.\nGreg Smith: So there are sort of two comments in my prepared remarks. One talked about socket wins for VIPs. And those socket wins are in both cloud compute and in EDGE devices. And the right way to model that is perhaps a little bit starting towards the end of 2024, but definitely hitting much more seriously in 2025. The other reference that I made was for an SLT win for a compute customer, and that\u2019s definitely something that\u2019s going to take until 2025 to build to material volume.\nMehdi Hosseini: Okay. Great. Perhaps I will follow-up with Andy, what VIP is?\nGreg Smith: That\u2019s \u2013 sorry. We \u2013 because most of the \u2013 there are a number of players that are designing their own silicon. And typically, a big portion of those are the hyperscalers, but there are \u2013 there are players in that space that don\u2019t fit the traditional hyperscaler model. So like a large integrated automaker or people that are doing custom silicon development for their own handsets or customer devices. So we prefer the term vertically integrated producer, but you can read that as hyperscale.\nMehdi Hosseini: Okay, thank you for the color. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. I\u2019m wondering if you can go through the TAM numbers, how the different segments came in, in \u201823? I know the breakout before was compute $1.3 billion, Mobility was $900 million, Auto is where I think a little more than $600 million. If you can just \u2013 did the market come in about as you thought it would for \u201823 and then can you shape \u201824 for those segments? I know it\u2019s flat at a high level, but I would imagine Autos are probably down a couple of hundred million. And maybe Computes up a couple of hundred million. That\u2019s the delta. Can you just run through that?\nSanjay Mehta: Sure. Hi, Tim, it\u2019s Sanjay. So we estimate the SOC TAM in 2023, you were going down the correct numbers that haven\u2019t really changed. But just for specifics. We view the Compute market at $1.3 billion, Mobility at $900 million, Auto at $600 million, Industrial at $400 million and Service at $700 million. That\u2019s how you get to the $3.9 billion. And then the midpoint of 2024, Compute is $1.4 billion, Mobility at $0.9 billion. Auto and MCU at $0.5 billion, Industrial of $0.4 billion and Service \u2013 SSC service at $0.7 billion to get to the $3.9 billion at our midpoint.\nTimothy Arcuri: Got it. Okay. So it is Compute. It\u2019s just a little bit of mix shift. Okay. And then can you talk about your largest customer? Your big customer on the mobility side, which was actually not your largest customer in 2023. I know you have a range of outcomes this year. I\u2019m not asking for numbers on that range, but can you talk about sort of what you think at the midpoint, how big they could be as \u2013 is there a case where they are back percent of your revenue range in 2024? Or is that just off the table?\nGreg Smith: So, hi, this is Greg. Our historically largest customer, we\u2019ve said that like in 2023, they are going to come in at under 10%. Looking forward into 2024, our base case, again, has them at less than 10% of total revenue. Right now, our visibility into their second half demand is quite limited. And we usually have a better picture of that in the April time frame. So if we get any better information about it, we will share it at that time. But the thing that you should think about is that there isn\u2019t there isn\u2019t much downside to our base case around anything that happens with our historically largest customer.\nTimothy Arcuri: Got it. Okay, thank you, Greg.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question.\nC.J. Muse: Yes, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. In your prepared remarks, you talked about confidence in the second half recovery for SSC test. So I was hoping you could walk through, what\u2019s giving you the confidence and how you see that recovery emerging? And perhaps you could speak to OSAT versus end customers, content, edge AI, whatever you think is really going to move the needle for you guys and drive that second half recovery over the first half?\nGreg Smith: Sure. So the leading indicator that we tend to look at most is really around utilization rates. And right now, those utilization rates are low, but we did start to see OSAT utilization start to tick up. So they are still below normal seasonality, but they are definitely improving. And we believe that they could reach sort of the point \u2013 the levels that would trigger buying by the third quarter of this year, if the trend that we\u2019re seeing continues. The key end market trends that we\u2019re looking for is unit growth in smartphones and PCs. PCs have been in a real pit. And so just from a refresh cycle, we\u2019re expecting to see that recovering a bit and that would be a tailwind for us. The thing that we also saw in the fourth quarter was that utilization came down a bit in IDMs. And so they are primarily the \u2013 that\u2019s where most of our business is concentrated for Industrial and Automotive. So we saw the Industrial part of that start to weaken in the second half of 2023. And then late in 2023 \u2013 late in Q4 of 2023, we also started to see Automotive begin to weaken. The \u2013 our model right now has that that\u2019s a relatively short lull in demand. And we think that that\u2019s mainly driven by the fact that new model year introductions, every year for the automakers has a significantly higher attach rate for electronics and that\u2019s driving a pretty good CAGR in the Automotive Semiconductor market. So we think the fundamentals are good to drive growth in Automotive. So we think that this demand lull is going to be relatively short.\nC.J. Muse: Very helpful. And if I could follow-up on the SLT side. You talked about wins across both mobility and HBC. I know you have one very large customer. Would be curious the timing of the ramp of revenues here? And could they, in aggregate, get to kind of the scale of your very large customer or that will take years to do that?\nGreg Smith: So the \u2013 in the prepared remarks, I was referring to system-level test wins for Mobility and for Compute. And if you put that into context, the customer that we won for Mobility is not as large as our primary SLT customer, but they have the potential to drive significant volume. In Compute, that\u2019s something that\u2019s going to take a while to take off. The device plans basically for SLT, it was a hyperscaler customer in Compute and the volumes for those devices is going to start at a relatively small level and then increase over time. So I don\u2019t think that any of those in isolation would rise to the level of our historically largest customer, but it\u2019s more additional incremental tailwinds for us.\nC.J. Muse: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next questions are from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please proceed with your questions.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. And I appreciate you giving the Compute TAM, which is now the largest end market. Could you help us break that between more client Compute versus data center? And then the growth rate that you\u2019re mentioning, the 1.3% to 1.4%, that seems very modest compared to all the very high growth rates that we see in AI and data center right type products. So, if you could just give us a little more color, how much is client versus data center? And then why only such modest growth in testing? Why don\u2019t we see more of a correlation with the growth in data-centric products?\nGreg Smith: Hi, Vivek, this is Greg. So first of all, let me talk a little bit about client versus data center. As far as we can tell in 2023, most of the Test capacity adds in Compute, were really in support of data center. That the client market has been very, very quiet. Looking forward into the future, we think that the capacity adds required for cloud are going to moderate a bit. They have added a ton of productive capacity in 2023, and that is going to be felt in higher-end volumes in 2024, so they are at sort of a new high watermark in terms of that part of the market. The client side, there are two things that I think are going to accelerate things. The first is that the unit volume in PCs is at a very low point right now. There is really nowhere to go but up. And the other is that we\u2019ve been seeing the push in large language models in AI, primarily on the training side right now. And looking at the roadmaps for our customers, they are putting a huge push on custom silicon for Edge AI inference versus the training part. So, I think we are going to see a shift over the next 3 years, to a much more balanced market, whereas 2023 was dominated by data center, as we get out through this mid-term, it\u2019s going to be much more balanced between data center and client. Now, in terms of the modest size, the thing that I want to just \u2013 I want to try and provide a little bit of context, that if you look back to the high watermark for the total SOC TAM, back in 2021, it was about a $4.9 billion market. And in that $4.9 billion market, less than $1.2 billion of it was in compute. Now, fast forwarding to this year, the overall TAM is down to $3.9 billion, and compute is representing of $1.3 billion of that total. Now, as you look into 2024, that\u2019s a very high level that it\u2019s at right now. And that level supports significantly increased production for these devices. The last thing that I will point out is these devices are big and complex, and they have a high test intensity. But the unit volumes are relatively small, and the margin, the margin in the end market for these devices is very high. So, the revenue that compute makers are getting on these devices is pretty great. But it means that the number of testers required to fulfill that revenue demand is a little bit lower than it would be in the mobile space.\nVivek Arya: Right. And for my follow-up, I actually had two small ones. I don\u2019t know whether they are related or not, but there was some media reports about Teradyne kind of pulling out of the China market from just the manufacturing footprint. I just wanted to see if there was any clarification around that? But the bigger question, Greg, that I have is, when I look at this mid-term model and the forecast of growing, right, kind of low, mid-20s in \u201825 and \u201826. If I look at the last decade, the only year Teradyne grew above that rate was just like one of the years, and that too was 2020. So, why keep such a high forecast and back to for 2 years, what is the kind of the visibility and confidence in hitting those kind of growth rates?\nGreg Smith: Yes. So, first, just a quick comment on China. The news report is really nothing new. We have had a multiyear effort going on to increase the resilience of our supply chain. And that involved moving production locations for some of our products. We still have an extensive supply chain that is in China. We have over 600 people in China. We are competing for business and winning in China. And I think that it\u2019s a good headline, but there is nothing new in that story or in our commitment to that region, as a place where we expect to grow. So, on the mid-term model, if you look at the \u2013 if you look with a longer lens than you are talking about, we have been in this market for 60 years. And we have seen the dynamics of the market as it comes out of downturns. So, in coming out of 2001, coming out of 2009, and then, again, the COVID-related demand increase in 2020. It\u2019s not that unprecedented to see significant growth in the years following a downturn. And looking at the state of the end market for mobile phones, and the end market for PCs, we really expect to see a pretty good snapback. The other X factor that I think we are becoming increasingly confident in is how generative AI is going to impact complexity of devices. So, we were really kind of wondering what was going to be the next thing that drove complexity at the in handsets, in cars, at the edge. And it appears that the technology is incorporated in these large language models and the amount of compute that they need to execute is something that is a very positive tailwind both in the mobile and the compute part of the market. One final reminder is, as you look at this, when you think about Edge AI, a lot of that is going to accrue to growth in the mobile part of the market and the automotive part of the market, not in the compute part of the market.\nVivek Arya: Thank you, Greg.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nKrish Sankar: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. The first one is for Greg or Sanjay. When I look at your Q1 guidance compared to the last time we had that revenue run rate, your earnings power is almost half of that. I am just wondering, is there a function of maybe lower gross margin due to product mix like less auto analog testers, or is it because of higher investments in IA, a combination? I am just kind of curious. And then a follow-up after that.\nGreg Smith: Sure. So, I think it\u2019s really fundamentally two things in Q1. One is much lower volume, but then really product mix. Say, product mix is a little bit of a bigger driver, nothing more than that. It\u2019s product mix and volumes.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Kind of like a more philosophical question for Greg. Greg, clearly, obviously, on the mobile test side, you have a good position. And then the last several years, it seems like your focus was on IA. And then now you have got the big investment in Technoprobe, which kind of came out of the blue and historically like vertical integration between test and probe card has never worked. I am just kind of curious [ph], is it because the last few years, you took your eye off the test market, but now you are beginning to see a shift away from mobile to compute and you need to do certain things, or is there something else going on?\nGreg Smith: So, I think the \u2013 there is no real change in our strategic priorities. And so our strategic priorities has always been to look for accretive investments and opportunities to put free cash flow to work for our investors in the most effective way. We didn\u2019t take our eye off the ball on test, when we were talking about our industrial automation business. And as a matter of fact, over the period of time that you are talking about the industrial automation business was accretive that we were making money, and that IA business had a rough year in 2023, mainly because of end market conditions. So, we haven\u2019t changed our strategy. The thing that\u2019s different and the thing that really motivated the investment in Technoprobebe is that there is a trend in the test market that is drawing the tester and the interface closer together. And that\u2019s really driven by the complexity and performance in the end market. So, if you look at the data rates that are required for SOC and memory devices, if you look at the bandwidths required for RF devices, if you look at the number of devices that customers want to test in parallel, all of those are driving a tighter integration between tester and interface. And by establishing a partnership with TPI, we believe that we were going to be able to achieve an advantage in terms of unlocking value for our customers that exists in the technology that Technoprobe has in those interfaces and our testers have in their architecture. So, I wouldn\u2019t say that the \u2013 like the Technoprobe investment reflects a change in strategy, more it reflects the fact that we have been monitoring the trends in the test market, and we discerned an opportunity for us to do something great for our customers and our investors.\nKrish Sankar: Thank you, Greg.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Brian Chin with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Chin: Hi there. Good morning. Thanks if I can ask a few questions. Maybe Greg, in the past discussion, my numbers are a little bit off, but I believe you have anticipated the hyperscaler ASIC companies maybe driving or representing $400 million or so of incremental growth in the compute TAM in coming years. I guess how large do you see this market by 2026? And based on your customer wins and ongoing traction, what do you think your market share of this incremental could be in that timeframe?\nGreg Smith: So, I think I will end up phoning a friend with Andy here in terms of what we have said in terms of projected TAM for that market.\nAndy Blanchard: Yes. We have said it\u2019s in the $400 million to $600 million range in \u201826, \u201827 time\u2026\nGreg Smith: Right. And we have said that has \u2013 there is modest growth in the overall Compute segment over that period of time. So, both, we are going to see a slight decline in sort of the traditional compute part of the market and this $400 million to $600 million of new hyperscaler VIP. The way that you can think about this is we are always putting up a good fight to try and win share in the traditional compute space. But we really think that our opportunity is to gain share in that $400 million to $600 million chunk. And what we have seen is, we are like \u2013 say, we are at below 20% share in the traditional market. In terms of socket wins, the sockets that we see in the market, and we are competing for, we are definitely winning more than our fair share. So, we are winning the majority of sockets that we are targeting. And so we are very hopeful that we will end up with a pretty good split inside of that $400 million to $600 million.\nBrian Chin: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe focusing on the memory test part of the test TAM, I think your main competitor as of last night is forecasting much stronger year-over-year growth in memory test than you this year. They are largely tied off to DRAM. I guess how can we reconcile your up 10 with their sort of maybe more optimistic forecast? And does that do you think potentially represent upside to your view this year?\nGreg Smith: I think it could represent upside to our view. But the thing that I will remind you is that if you look at the memory test market, we typically break it up into four chunks. So, two types of memory DRAM and NAND Flash and then the wafer sort and then the final test. Our highest share is in the final test for both DRAM and for Flash memory. What we have seen in 2023 is technology-related buying in those spaces, and that has been a great tailwind to our share in that market. What we don\u2019t have clear visibility into or real forecast from our customers is how much capacity they are going to need to add at wafer sort. So, that\u2019s not a technology-driven retooling space. That\u2019s something where they can use the same testers for new generations of parts. And they need to have production volumes that drive additional acquisitions. It\u2019s entirely possible that our competitor has a better view into the long-term needs in the wafer sort for some of those customers than we do. So \u2013 and it\u2019s also possible that we have not seen the benefit in that part of the market. So, I am pretty confident in our \u2013 in that we have a good view of our memory business for 2024. I think there is an upside potential depending on how much capacity add is required as the memory inventories come down.\nBrian Chin: Okay. Very helpful. Thanks Greg.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Maybe for the first one, if I can ask you in relation to the long-term model of the 2026 model, you are outlining strong growth in the Robotics segment, as you see a lot of opportunities for growth. How should we think about as you sort of invest towards that growth, what profitability can you drive to in that 2026 model for robotics? And I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nGreg Smith: Hi Samik. So, in terms of the long-term model, our goals remain kind of consistent for our robotics group that our target performance is 20% to 30% growth and our target profit is 5% to 15%. What we have said previously and what we are still operating to is, as we are watching the growth develop in that market, if it appears that incremental investment is not yielding higher growth rates, then we will feather those back to try to increase the profit range. But as long as we believe that we are at this low penetration and there are fruitful investments that we can make, we would prefer to make those investments and continue to drive growth. The key thing that we are doing in operating that group is we are really focusing on maintaining high gross margins. So, we are in excess of 60% gross margins for the group now and we are intent on keeping those gross margins at that level so that we have the option to sort of dial the profit that is appropriate to the growth rate we are achieving.\nSamik Chatterjee: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And for my follow-up, just a question on gross margin for the year, I think for the full year 2024, you are guiding to 58% to 59% million with the starting point you have, that does imply, I think if I do the math that you would be at some point during the year crossing 60%. Am I sort of calculating that right? Is that sort of what you are implying? And what are the drivers to get to that 60% level during 2024 itself with the volume challenges that you are seeing right now in the test market? Thank you.\nSanjay Mehta: Yes. So, you are right. I think some of the quarters, we do anticipate to be higher than our model, really coming back with a stronger product mix. In various quarters, we have obviously higher volume. And then some of our higher product lines or some of our higher margin product lines do come back. So, it\u2019s volume in the quarters, but mainly product mix and product line mix that are driving the improvement. I should add that there is also operational efficiencies that we are working on that we anticipate that will help margins as well in the back half.\nSamik Chatterjee: Great. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: The next questions are from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nToshiya Hari: Hi. Good morning. I had two as well. The first one on HBM, Greg, can you characterize your competitive position in this market, I guess number one. Number two, how big was HBM as a percentage of your memory business either in calendar \u201823 or Q4? And with your customers sort of expecting 50%, 60% growth on an annual basis over the next couple of years or several years, should we think about \u2013 should we think \u2013 should we assume the growth rate in your business to be in that ZIP code, or could there be retooling or parallel test that sort of deflates that number?\nGreg Smith: Okay. So, you packed a lot of parts into that question. So, let me start unpacking it. So, first, in terms of competitive position, right now, we are roughly splitting the HBM test market with our competitors. So, if you look at overall share, that\u2019s a positive to our share that there are multiple competitors in the overall memory space. But the HBM part of the market is pretty much a clean split between us and our competitor. In Q4, we think HBM represented more than 50% of our memory shipments. So, it was a huge factor in that quarter. And in terms of growth, we think that there is the potential for growth that there are new HBM competitors that are coming on the scene. So, there is both a unit volume growth. I think that a lot of that \u2013 the capacity for a lot of that is in place now. But there are also standards changes, HBM3E and HBM4 that are coming, and those are driving retooling for performance tests. And we think that, that is going to be a potential driver for us in the back half of the year in memory.\nToshiya Hari: Got it. Thank you. And then as my follow-up on the robotics side, just wanted to get your thoughts on \u201824. You are guiding the business up 10% to 20%. You talked about obviously, the long-term value proposition, which makes sense. You are ramping the UR30, you talked about some of the initiatives you are doing from a channel distribution perspective. So, I am just curious, if you are guiding the long-term up 20% to 30%, why up 10% to 20% this year particularly given the fact that \u201823 was down close to 10%. What\u2019s sort of weighing on growth this year? Thank you.\nGreg Smith: Well, I think, the key thing that is limiting our optimism is that even though we had a really great Q4, we had a really great Q4 because we introduced basically a blockbuster product. 24% or so of our revenue in Q4 came from that product. Underlying that, there is still some fundamental weakness in the industrial end market. And there are predictions that, that is going to ease, that the demand is going to come back relatively strongly. But we are entering Q1 of 2024 with PMIs at a relatively low level and a fair amount of some regions that are quite quiet. So, we have optimism for continued growth through the year, both quarter-on-quarter through the year and each quarter in comparison to the year prior. But we are coming in with a relatively low Q1. So, we wanted to be careful in terms of where we set the bar for growth for the full year.\nToshiya Hari: Thanks Greg.\nAndy Blanchard: Okay. And operator, we are out of time. So, folks that are still in the queue, I will get back to you later this morning. But thanks everyone for joining and we look forward to talking to you in the days and weeks ahead. Bye.\nOperator: Thank you. This will conclude today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Sanjay Mehta",
            "content": "Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover the financial summary of Q4, the full year 2023, provide our Q1 outlook, some planning guidance for full year 2024, review our updated earnings model and outline our capital allocation plan. Now to Q4. Fourth quarter sales were $671 million, with non-GAAP EPS of $0.79, both in line with our guidance. Semi Test revenue of $431 million at SOC revenue of $327 million, with high memory shipments of $104 million, as Greg noted in his highlights. System Test group had revenue of $86 million, down 14% from Q4 \u201822. Growth in Defense and Aerospace was offset by weakness in storage test and production board test. LifePoint revenue of $25 million was weaker year-over-year due to continued weakness in cellular, PC markets. Robotics revenue of $129 million was up 17% from the fourth quarter of last year and up 50% sequentially on seasonally high demand and the impact of UR20 and UR30 new product shipments. Non-GAAP gross margin was 56.6% in the middle of our guidance range and non-GAAP operating expenses were $245 million in Q4, up $2 million from Q3 \u201823. Non-GAAP operating profit rate was 20.1%. Some other financial facts. We had one 10% customer in the quarter. Tax rate, excluding discrete items for the quarter was 12.6% on a non-GAAP basis and lower than planned because of geographic mix. GAAP tax rate was 14% in Q4, excluding discrete items. We repurchased $51 million of shares in the quarter. Turning to the full year results. We had revenue of $2.676 billion. Texas Instruments was the only customer greater 10% of our revenue for the year. Gross margin for the year was 57.4%. OpEx was $990 million and operating profit was 20.4%. Non-GAAP EPS was $2.93. We generated $426 million in free cash flow in 2023. We returned $468 million or 110% of free cash flow to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We ended the year with $937 million of cash and marketable securities. Our tax rate for the full year, excluding discrete items, was 15.5% on a non-GAAP basis and 15.25% on a GAAP basis. Semi Test revenue for the year was approximately $1.8 billion, with SOC revenue contributing $1.43 billion and Memory $386 million. Our SOC sales contracted 16% in 2023, in line with the continued mobility market weakness, partially offset by strength in auto and industrial. In Memory, our sales grew about 4%, driven by new technologies like UFS4 and Flash and LPDDR5 and HBM and DRAM. System Test group had revenue of $338 million in 2023. Combined Defense and Aerospace and production board test sales were both flat, while HDD and system-level test in our storage business were down in total nearly 50% from 2022. In Wireless Test, revenue of $144 million in 2023 was lower year-on-year, given the decline in handset units and continued weakness in the networking and PC markets. Now to Robotics. Robotics revenue in 2023 was $375 million, with UR contributing $304 million and MiR $71 million. The group had mid-teens profitability in Q4 \u201823, but for the full year, had an 8% non-GAAP operating loss. While UR was profitable in 2023, we continue to lean into R&D and channel enhancement investments in MiR. Now to our outlook for Q1. Since our October call, SOC test demand has softened, which impacts our Q1 outlook. Q1 sales are expected to be between $540 million and $590 million, with non-GAAP EPS in a range of $0.22 to $0.38 on 162 million diluted shares. The first quarter guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles. First quarter gross margins are expected to be the low point for the year and are estimated at 53.5% to 54.5%, due to lower volume and unfavorable product mix. OpEx is expected to be roughly flat with Q4 \u201823 and run at 42% to 46% of first quarter sales. Non-GAAP operating profit rate at the midpoint of our first quarter guidance is 10%. A few points to assist you in modeling 2024. First, the gross margin profile. In 2024, we expect gross margins to increase through the year. Gross margins are forecasted to improve to 58% to 59% for the full year driven by improved product mix, including the sale of the Device Interface Solutions or DIS business, lower business resiliency spending and operational improvements. Moving to the strategic partnership we announced with Technoprobe in November 2023. The agreement has several key components as follows: first, Technoprobe will purchase Teradyne's DIS business. This business provides advanced interfaces that connect our testers to customers' chips for test. Second, Teradyne will make an equity investment in Technoprobe, acquiring 10% of their outstanding shares. Third, Teradyne and Technoprobe will work together on a series of projects to expand the performance of semiconductor device interfaces, to enable customers to realize the full performance of our test systems. We expect the transactions to close in the second quarter. DIS had 2023 revenue of $103 million and the sales will reduce Teradyne's expected 2024 revenue by approximately $100 million, assuming the Q2 close date. It will not have a material impact on earnings. We plan to account for our investment in Technoprobe, using the equity accounting method. Regarding OpEx for the full year, we expect full year 2024 OpEx to increase 5% to 7%, driven by strategic projects to grow share in our Test businesses. The growth will be back half loaded. Robotics is expected to grow revenue 10% to 20% in 2024, enabling Robotics to be profitable. The group will have a similar revenue profile as a company with second half expected at 56% of full year revenue. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate is forecasted to be 16% in 2024, excluding discrete items. Turning to capital allocation. Our strategy remains consistent, as we take a balanced approach to maintain a minimum cash level of $800 million, which enables us to run the business, have cash reserves set aside in the event of a significant downturn and have dry powder for M&A. For reference, from 2015 to 2023, we've returned over $4.3 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, which is 97% of our free cash flow. Earlier this month, we also announced a 9% increase in our dividend to $0.12 per quarter. We expect to close our investment in Technoprobe and our divestiture of DIS in Q2, which will consume an estimated $440 million of net cash. We will limit our share buybacks in 2024 to an amount necessary to offset dilution from equity compensation and our employee share purchase program in order to build cash back up to a minimum goal of $800 million. Therefore, we do not expect to materially reduce the share count in 2024. Moving to our mid-term earnings model. As we do each January, we've updated our model. We share this with investors to provide insight into how we look at the markets we serve, our competitive positioning and ultimately, the growth and earnings power of the company. A few points for context. First, we've kept 2026 as at year-end so you can make an easy comparison with last year's update. Second, financial ranges are down to reflect our revised view of the markets in which we participate. Greg outlined the key drivers for the Test portfolio, including device technology trends, complexity and unit growth, which we anticipate will drive ATE growth over the 3-year horizon. Our Test revenues are expected to grow at a CAGR of 12% to 18% from 2023's muted level to 2026, driven primarily by a recovery in Mobility Test demand. For Robotics, we're looking at a strong market opportunity. The drivers over the mid [Technical Difficulty] include labor shortages, new products and applications, including a growing range of AI-driven products and our channel transformation work. Our Robotics revenues are expected to grow at 20% to 30% CAGR from 2023 to 2026. The updated earnings model will drive 2026 revenue to approximately $4.3 billion and non-GAAP EPS to $6.50 at the midpoint of the model range. Our model at the midpoint, as a revenue CAGR from 2023 to 2026 of 17% and on EPS at 30%, highlighting the operating leverage of both Robotics and Test portfolios. Gross margin is estimated at 59% to 60%. OpEx as a percentage of sales will be 28% to 31%, yielding a non-GAAP operating margin of 28% to 32%. Summing up, we had a challenging year in 2023 and still delivered 20% operating profit on a non-GAAP basis. Generated $426 million in free cash flow and returned 110% of that cash to shareholders. We did this while we strengthened our competitive position in Test and Robotics with new products, invested in channel transformation and Robotics and announced a strategic partnership and Test Interfaces to drive Semi Test share growth. Looking ahead, we expect a return to growth later this year and beyond, driven by favorable trends in both Test and Robotics and the financial impact of that growth is reflected in our updated mid-term earnings model. With that, I'll turn the call back to Andy. Andy? Sure. Hi, Tim, it's Sanjay. So we estimate the SOC TAM in 2023, you were going down the correct numbers that haven't really changed. But just for specifics. We view the Compute market at $1.3 billion, Mobility at $900 million, Auto at $600 million, Industrial at $400 million and Service at $700 million. That's how you get to the $3.9 billion. And then the midpoint of 2024, Compute is $1.4 billion, Mobility at $0.9 billion. Auto and MCU at $0.5 billion, Industrial of $0.4 billion and Service \u2013 SSC service at $0.7 billion to get to the $3.9 billion at our midpoint. Yes. So, you are right. I think some of the quarters, we do anticipate to be higher than our model, really coming back with a stronger product mix. In various quarters, we have obviously higher volume. And then some of our higher product lines or some of our higher margin product lines do come back. So, it's volume in the quarters, but mainly product mix and product line mix that are driving the improvement. I should add that there is also operational efficiencies that we are working on that we anticipate that will help margins as well in the back half."

            "name": "Greg Smith",
            "content": "Hello, everyone and thanks for joining us this morning. Today, I will summarize our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results, comment on our early view of 2024 and describe the market assumptions underpinning our updated midterm earnings model. Sanjay will then provide financial details on all of these topics. We delivered Q4 financial results in line with our guidance. The clear highlights for the quarter were the \u2013 were Memory Test, where DRAM tester revenue more than doubled from Q4 2022 on HBM demand and our Robotics team's execution in growing sales, 17% from Q4 2022 and 50% sequentially, as we ramp shipments to address the record backlog of our new UR20 Cobot at Universal Robots. Balancing these strengths in Memory and Robotics was continued softness in our other test markets. Shifting now to the full year, 2023 was the second consecutive year that the size of the semiconductor test market declined, as the industry digested record shipments in 2020 and 2021, driven by COVID-related demand. The SOC test market has declined 21% from 2021 and the mobility portion has contracted 55% over the same period. Most of that decline occurred in 2023, with SOC demand down 17% year-on-year. Mobility has historically been the largest sub-segment of the SOC market and an area of strength for us in semiconductor test and in wireless test. Despite the weakness in demand, the trend towards vertically integrated producers is continuing. This new class of customer provides an opportunity for Teradyne to gain share in high-performance computing, a segment where we have historically had low share. These customers will take time to ramp. And so we are focusing on capturing sockets. On that front, 2023 was a great year for us, capturing the majority of key VIP sockets, where we targeted at customers in the United States and in China. Although automotive was strong for most of 2023, at the end of the year, elevated inventories for our automotive customers began to slow down the rate at which they add test capacity. Our latest estimate of the Semi Test market for 2023 is about $4.8 billion, with $3.9 billion in SOC and $900 million in Memory Test. Our 2023 financial results reflected the test market weakness and when combined with a tepid robotics market, company sales were $2.676 billion, down about 15% and non-GAAP earnings of $2.93 were down 31% from 2022. As we enter 2024, let me describe how we are looking at the current market. Visibility is limited, but we are cautiously optimistic. In SOC test, chip inventories remain high and subcon tester utilization remains in the 70s. These combined to create a headwind to tester demand in the first half of 2024. The inventory overhang now extends to parts of the legacy automotive market, which began to soften late in Q4. With this softening of demand, lead times for our SOC testers are now back to pre-COVID levels, generally less than 16 weeks. This enables customers to wait to place new orders until their demand is certain, limiting our visibility. Our current view is that these headwinds will abate midyear and we are planning for a second \u2013 a stronger second half in SOC test. Several leading indicators point to a second half improvement. For example, we have seen no slowdown in chip development activity at our customers, so the product pipeline remains healthy. While still below normal seasonality, utilization levels are beginning to inch upwards, especially in the OSATs, which points towards improving mobility and compute demand. Mobile phones are expected to adopt AI capabilities in the premium tier in 2024 and more broadly in 2025, which should accelerate complexity and be a positive for test demand. Despite the slowdown we are seeing now in automotive demand, the key driver for this market is the increased electronics content per vehicle, not end vehicle sales. Automotive semi devices are forecast to grow an 11% CAGR through the mid-term and device \u2013 this and the vast complexity is increasing. Therefore, we expect this law will be short-lived. In Memory Test, the story for 2023 is that despite high end market inventories, demand for new testers was driven by the retooling required to test higher speed flash and DRAM devices especially HBM DRAM. This drove our memory share to a record 43% in 2023. In 2024, we expect continued Memory revenue growth driven by the volume production ramps of the technology introductions we saw in 2023 and continued R&D investments for even faster devices. As business conditions improve for Memory makers, this may drive increased demand to support capacity expansion. Shifting now to other test markets. Wireless test demand is expected to remain at current levels in 2024 due to weakness in the networking equipment demand and excess capacity in smartphone test. In System Test, we expect continued strength in Defense and Aerospace markets and expect modest growth in demand and production board test. We expect storage test will remain weak in 2024, due to excess test capacity in the HDD and SLT test markets. Having said that, in 2023, we added important new SLT customers in mobility and high-performance computing that are setting us up for mid-term growth. Shifting to Robotics. We had a very strong Q4 as our UR20 ramp continued and we launched the new UR30 late in the quarter. Looking at Robotics for the full year 2023. In addition to the good progress on the new product front, our channel transformation work continued nicely with our OEM sales growing nearly 10%, as we added more than 50 new OEM partners. We have also expanded the number of large accounts we manage directly from approximately 100 to over 250. We expect Q1 of 2024 to be down more than the normal seasonal dip, as the extraordinary Q4 shipments are digested. Thereafter, we expect quarterly year-on-year growth through the rest of 2024. Combining all these points and with the provisor that our view into the second half is limited, we are modeling 2024 company revenue to be roughly flat year-on-year with 44% in the first half and 56% in the second half. Within that, we expect lower test revenue in 2024, which reflects the sale of our DIS business, reducing our full year semiconductor test revenue by approximately $100 million. Excluding the effects of that sale, expected test revenue would have been about flat in a roughly flat market. In Semi Test, our early estimate of the SOC market size for 2024 is $3.6 billion to $4.2 billion. And our estimate for Memory is $1 billion to $1.1 billion, for a combined Semiconductor Test market at the midpoint of $4.95 billion. We expect Robotics will grow in the 10% to 20% range in 2024. Turning now to our mid-term models. Despite the longer-than-expected downturn in the Mobile Test market and the softness in Robotics and demand, we remain optimistic about the long-term potential of our test and robotics businesses. This is shown in the update to our mid-term earnings model. At the midpoint in 2026, we expect to deliver earnings per share at over 2x the 2023 level and a revenue growth of nearly 60%. As we have noted in past calls, the key drivers of that growth include process node advances to 3-nanometer, 2-nanometer, gate all around and backside power delivery. These are all on track or even accelerating and they enable higher transistor counts, higher complexity and that drives longer test times. Good progress in the emerging VIP space with key wins at design-in targets and high share at two of the three leading ASIC design houses, all of which drive future revenue. Advanced packaging, including chiplet technology, which requires higher test intensity at the wafer level, driving longer test times. Compelling applications of Edge AI for ADAS and smartphone co-pilots that are driving demand for more processing power, more memory and wider bandwidth communications. All of these factors accelerate test demand. There is an aggressive roadmap for increases in memory interface speeds in DRAM HBM, and Flash that will continue to drive technology-driven retooling in the Memory market. And finally, in Robotics, we are still at less than 5% market penetration. And we are confident that our channel strategy will unlock the long-term growth potential of this market. In addition, the application of AI is expanding the range of tasks that our robots can serve, while our new products will expand our served market and decrease the effort required for customers to automate. At the company level, compared to last year, our growth outlook has shifted to the right, but the slope of expected growth is largely unchanged. The duration of the downturn in mobile demand has been longer than we expected and the softness in the industrial automation market that we and our peers have seen has really impacted our expectations of growth in Robotics for 2023. Sanjay will provide more financial details of the model. As we look at our results for 2023 and the outlook for 2024, we are focused on improving gross margins and maintaining tight financial discipline, while making the necessary R&D and customer-facing investments required to capture the long-term growth potential in both the test and robotics markets. To maintain that financial discipline, we will be looking to see signs of top line growth before allowing OpEx to materially increase. We operate our business with mid-term plans that track long-term historical trends and the future demand drivers in each of our businesses rather than trying to predict short-term cycles. In any given year, results will land above or below that trend, but that trend line has provided a reliable baseline for planning. As expected, 2023 was below trend line, but the underlying demand drivers remain in place and we are executing our plans to capture that future demand. We are excited about the opportunities ahead and we have deep confidence in our team's ability to capture those opportunities. With that, I will turn things over to Sanjay. Sanjay? Hi, Mehdi, this is Greg. So the composition of the TAM in the mid-term model, if you compare this year to last year, I think the biggest change is that we think that the that the compute part of the market is going to be at a higher level, than we did last year. And we think that the mobile portion of the market is going to be up from where it is now but will not be at the level that we were modeling last year. So we believe that the pace of transistor density is proceeding basically at the same rate that we thought it was proceeding last year. The real difference is that the end market sort of end unit market predictions going out through the mid-term are a bit softer in this model than they were last time. And certainly, the impact of cloud and Edge AI in the market is a relatively new factor and is strengthening the compute part of it. So there are sort of two comments in my prepared remarks. One talked about socket wins for VIPs. And those socket wins are in both cloud compute and in EDGE devices. And the right way to model that is perhaps a little bit starting towards the end of 2024, but definitely hitting much more seriously in 2025. The other reference that I made was for an SLT win for a compute customer, and that's definitely something that's going to take until 2025 to build to material volume. That's \u2013 sorry. We \u2013 because most of the \u2013 there are a number of players that are designing their own silicon. And typically, a big portion of those are the hyperscalers, but there are \u2013 there are players in that space that don't fit the traditional hyperscaler model. So like a large integrated automaker or people that are doing custom silicon development for their own handsets or customer devices. So we prefer the term vertically integrated producer, but you can read that as hyperscale. So, hi, this is Greg. Our historically largest customer, we've said that like in 2023, they are going to come in at under 10%. Looking forward into 2024, our base case, again, has them at less than 10% of total revenue. Right now, our visibility into their second half demand is quite limited. And we usually have a better picture of that in the April time frame. So if we get any better information about it, we will share it at that time. But the thing that you should think about is that there isn't there isn't much downside to our base case around anything that happens with our historically largest customer. Sure. So the leading indicator that we tend to look at most is really around utilization rates. And right now, those utilization rates are low, but we did start to see OSAT utilization start to tick up. So they are still below normal seasonality, but they are definitely improving. And we believe that they could reach sort of the point \u2013 the levels that would trigger buying by the third quarter of this year, if the trend that we're seeing continues. The key end market trends that we're looking for is unit growth in smartphones and PCs. PCs have been in a real pit. And so just from a refresh cycle, we're expecting to see that recovering a bit and that would be a tailwind for us. The thing that we also saw in the fourth quarter was that utilization came down a bit in IDMs. And so they are primarily the \u2013 that's where most of our business is concentrated for Industrial and Automotive. So we saw the Industrial part of that start to weaken in the second half of 2023. And then late in 2023 \u2013 late in Q4 of 2023, we also started to see Automotive begin to weaken. The \u2013 our model right now has that that's a relatively short lull in demand. And we think that that's mainly driven by the fact that new model year introductions, every year for the automakers has a significantly higher attach rate for electronics and that's driving a pretty good CAGR in the Automotive Semiconductor market. So we think the fundamentals are good to drive growth in Automotive. So we think that this demand lull is going to be relatively short. So the \u2013 in the prepared remarks, I was referring to system-level test wins for Mobility and for Compute. And if you put that into context, the customer that we won for Mobility is not as large as our primary SLT customer, but they have the potential to drive significant volume. In Compute, that's something that's going to take a while to take off. The device plans basically for SLT, it was a hyperscaler customer in Compute and the volumes for those devices is going to start at a relatively small level and then increase over time. So I don't think that any of those in isolation would rise to the level of our historically largest customer, but it's more additional incremental tailwinds for us. Hi, Vivek, this is Greg. So first of all, let me talk a little bit about client versus data center. As far as we can tell in 2023, most of the Test capacity adds in Compute, were really in support of data center. That the client market has been very, very quiet. Looking forward into the future, we think that the capacity adds required for cloud are going to moderate a bit. They have added a ton of productive capacity in 2023, and that is going to be felt in higher-end volumes in 2024, so they are at sort of a new high watermark in terms of that part of the market. The client side, there are two things that I think are going to accelerate things. The first is that the unit volume in PCs is at a very low point right now. There is really nowhere to go but up. And the other is that we've been seeing the push in large language models in AI, primarily on the training side right now. And looking at the roadmaps for our customers, they are putting a huge push on custom silicon for Edge AI inference versus the training part. So, I think we are going to see a shift over the next 3 years, to a much more balanced market, whereas 2023 was dominated by data center, as we get out through this mid-term, it's going to be much more balanced between data center and client. Now, in terms of the modest size, the thing that I want to just \u2013 I want to try and provide a little bit of context, that if you look back to the high watermark for the total SOC TAM, back in 2021, it was about a $4.9 billion market. And in that $4.9 billion market, less than $1.2 billion of it was in compute. Now, fast forwarding to this year, the overall TAM is down to $3.9 billion, and compute is representing of $1.3 billion of that total. Now, as you look into 2024, that's a very high level that it's at right now. And that level supports significantly increased production for these devices. The last thing that I will point out is these devices are big and complex, and they have a high test intensity. But the unit volumes are relatively small, and the margin, the margin in the end market for these devices is very high. So, the revenue that compute makers are getting on these devices is pretty great. But it means that the number of testers required to fulfill that revenue demand is a little bit lower than it would be in the mobile space. Yes. So, first, just a quick comment on China. The news report is really nothing new. We have had a multiyear effort going on to increase the resilience of our supply chain. And that involved moving production locations for some of our products. We still have an extensive supply chain that is in China. We have over 600 people in China. We are competing for business and winning in China. And I think that it's a good headline, but there is nothing new in that story or in our commitment to that region, as a place where we expect to grow. So, on the mid-term model, if you look at the \u2013 if you look with a longer lens than you are talking about, we have been in this market for 60 years. And we have seen the dynamics of the market as it comes out of downturns. So, in coming out of 2001, coming out of 2009, and then, again, the COVID-related demand increase in 2020. It's not that unprecedented to see significant growth in the years following a downturn. And looking at the state of the end market for mobile phones, and the end market for PCs, we really expect to see a pretty good snapback. The other X factor that I think we are becoming increasingly confident in is how generative AI is going to impact complexity of devices. So, we were really kind of wondering what was going to be the next thing that drove complexity at the in handsets, in cars, at the edge. And it appears that the technology is incorporated in these large language models and the amount of compute that they need to execute is something that is a very positive tailwind both in the mobile and the compute part of the market. One final reminder is, as you look at this, when you think about Edge AI, a lot of that is going to accrue to growth in the mobile part of the market and the automotive part of the market, not in the compute part of the market. Sure. So, I think it's really fundamentally two things in Q1. One is much lower volume, but then really product mix. Say, product mix is a little bit of a bigger driver, nothing more than that. It's product mix and volumes. So, I think the \u2013 there is no real change in our strategic priorities. And so our strategic priorities has always been to look for accretive investments and opportunities to put free cash flow to work for our investors in the most effective way. We didn't take our eye off the ball on test, when we were talking about our industrial automation business. And as a matter of fact, over the period of time that you are talking about the industrial automation business was accretive that we were making money, and that IA business had a rough year in 2023, mainly because of end market conditions. So, we haven't changed our strategy. The thing that's different and the thing that really motivated the investment in Technoprobebe is that there is a trend in the test market that is drawing the tester and the interface closer together. And that's really driven by the complexity and performance in the end market. So, if you look at the data rates that are required for SOC and memory devices, if you look at the bandwidths required for RF devices, if you look at the number of devices that customers want to test in parallel, all of those are driving a tighter integration between tester and interface. And by establishing a partnership with TPI, we believe that we were going to be able to achieve an advantage in terms of unlocking value for our customers that exists in the technology that Technoprobe has in those interfaces and our testers have in their architecture. So, I wouldn't say that the \u2013 like the Technoprobe investment reflects a change in strategy, more it reflects the fact that we have been monitoring the trends in the test market, and we discerned an opportunity for us to do something great for our customers and our investors. So, I think I will end up phoning a friend with Andy here in terms of what we have said in terms of projected TAM for that market. Right. And we have said that has \u2013 there is modest growth in the overall Compute segment over that period of time. So, both, we are going to see a slight decline in sort of the traditional compute part of the market and this $400 million to $600 million of new hyperscaler VIP. The way that you can think about this is we are always putting up a good fight to try and win share in the traditional compute space. But we really think that our opportunity is to gain share in that $400 million to $600 million chunk. And what we have seen is, we are like \u2013 say, we are at below 20% share in the traditional market. In terms of socket wins, the sockets that we see in the market, and we are competing for, we are definitely winning more than our fair share. So, we are winning the majority of sockets that we are targeting. And so we are very hopeful that we will end up with a pretty good split inside of that $400 million to $600 million. I think it could represent upside to our view. But the thing that I will remind you is that if you look at the memory test market, we typically break it up into four chunks. So, two types of memory DRAM and NAND Flash and then the wafer sort and then the final test. Our highest share is in the final test for both DRAM and for Flash memory. What we have seen in 2023 is technology-related buying in those spaces, and that has been a great tailwind to our share in that market. What we don't have clear visibility into or real forecast from our customers is how much capacity they are going to need to add at wafer sort. So, that's not a technology-driven retooling space. That's something where they can use the same testers for new generations of parts. And they need to have production volumes that drive additional acquisitions. It's entirely possible that our competitor has a better view into the long-term needs in the wafer sort for some of those customers than we do. So \u2013 and it's also possible that we have not seen the benefit in that part of the market. So, I am pretty confident in our \u2013 in that we have a good view of our memory business for 2024. I think there is an upside potential depending on how much capacity add is required as the memory inventories come down. Hi Samik. So, in terms of the long-term model, our goals remain kind of consistent for our robotics group that our target performance is 20% to 30% growth and our target profit is 5% to 15%. What we have said previously and what we are still operating to is, as we are watching the growth develop in that market, if it appears that incremental investment is not yielding higher growth rates, then we will feather those back to try to increase the profit range. But as long as we believe that we are at this low penetration and there are fruitful investments that we can make, we would prefer to make those investments and continue to drive growth. The key thing that we are doing in operating that group is we are really focusing on maintaining high gross margins. So, we are in excess of 60% gross margins for the group now and we are intent on keeping those gross margins at that level so that we have the option to sort of dial the profit that is appropriate to the growth rate we are achieving. Okay. So, you packed a lot of parts into that question. So, let me start unpacking it. So, first, in terms of competitive position, right now, we are roughly splitting the HBM test market with our competitors. So, if you look at overall share, that's a positive to our share that there are multiple competitors in the overall memory space. But the HBM part of the market is pretty much a clean split between us and our competitor. In Q4, we think HBM represented more than 50% of our memory shipments. So, it was a huge factor in that quarter. And in terms of growth, we think that there is the potential for growth that there are new HBM competitors that are coming on the scene. So, there is both a unit volume growth. I think that a lot of that \u2013 the capacity for a lot of that is in place now. But there are also standards changes, HBM3E and HBM4 that are coming, and those are driving retooling for performance tests. And we think that, that is going to be a potential driver for us in the back half of the year in memory. Well, I think, the key thing that is limiting our optimism is that even though we had a really great Q4, we had a really great Q4 because we introduced basically a blockbuster product. 24% or so of our revenue in Q4 came from that product. Underlying that, there is still some fundamental weakness in the industrial end market. And there are predictions that, that is going to ease, that the demand is going to come back relatively strongly. But we are entering Q1 of 2024 with PMIs at a relatively low level and a fair amount of some regions that are quite quiet. So, we have optimism for continued growth through the year, both quarter-on-quarter through the year and each quarter in comparison to the year prior. But we are coming in with a relatively low Q1. So, we wanted to be careful in terms of where we set the bar for growth for the full year."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Andy Blanchard, you may begin.\nAndy Blanchard: Thank you, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our discussion of Teradyne's most recent financial results. I'm joined this morning by our CEO, Greg Smith, and our CFO, Sanjay Mehta. Following our opening remarks, we'll provide details of our performance for 2023's third quarter along with our outlook for the fourth quarter. The press release containing our third quarter results was issued last evening. We are providing slides on the Investor page of the website that may be helpful to you in following the discussion. Replays of this call will be available via the same page after the call ends. The matters that we discuss today will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause Teradyne's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statement contained in the earnings release as well as our most recent SEC filings. Additionally, those forward-looking statements are made as of today, and we take no obligation to update them as a result of developments occurring after this call. During today's call, we'll make reference to non-GAAP financial measures. We've posted additional information concerning these non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliation to the most directly-comparable GAAP financial measures were available on the Investor page of our website. Looking ahead, between now at our next earnings call, Teradyne expects to participate in technology or industrial-focused investor conferences hosted by Baird, UBS and Wolfe Research. Now, let's get on with the rest of the agenda. First, Greg will comment on our recent results and the market conditions as we enter the fourth quarter. Sanjay will then offer more details on our quarterly results, along with our guidance for the fourth quarter. We'll then answer your questions. And this call is scheduled for one hour. Greg?\nGreg Smith: Thanks, Andy, and good morning everyone. Today, I will summarize our Q3 results, describe the current business conditions and provide some insight on how we're thinking about 2024 and beyond. Sanjay will then provide the financial details on Q3, our outlook for Q4 and offer some comments on modeling next year. Third quarter sales and earnings were at the high end of our guidance range, as Robotics sales came in above plan and we cleared some supply constraints and tests. The second half of 2023 is playing out as we described in July. We expect to close out the year with strong Robotics shipments, amplified by new product shipments at UR and seasonally softer test shipments. In semiconductor test, the mobility correction cycle persists and shipments remain well below historic levels while our automotive test shipments remained high in Q3. Memory test shipments in Q3 were down sequentially due to the timing of shipments, but demand remained strong. LPDDR5 and HBM, both of which require higher-speed testers, drove the results. In wireless, demand remained muted in the quarter, given the weak smartphone market and lack of new wireless standards this year. In system test, defense and aerospace, and storage test groups were unplanned while production board tests softened in the quarter. Robotics demand has stabilized. In the first half of 2023, demand was quite low, down 21% versus the first half of 2022. In Q3, demand strengthened, with revenue nearly at 2022 levels and up 20% from Q2. Our shipments have stepped-up, as we execute an aggressive ramp of the new UR20 product and PMI seems to have stabilized a bit. Looking at the full-year of 2023, our estimates of the SOC test market size are unchanged at $3.7 billion to $4.1 billion, down about 15% at the midpoint from last year. The weakest segment of SOC is mobility, down about 40% from 2022 on slower complexity growth in smartphone semiconductors and year-on decline in units. The compute, automotive and industrial analog segments of the market will finish the year at similar levels to 2022. In memory test, we expect the market will be get the low end of the $900 million to $1 billion range, also unchanged from our July view. The demand for high-speed DRAM test remains high, as we close out 2023, which will help us tick-up a few points of memory share for the full year. Teradyne's System Test Group will finish 2023 downward than 20% from 2022. Within this group, we expect defense and aerospace will grow 10% year-on-year, as global defense spending ticked up. The other segments of the business were negatively impacted by over-supply in the HDD market and mobility weakness. Shifting now to Robotics. The macro environment for industry is incrementally better than last quarter, with global PMI stable or improving slightly. The highlight of the quarter is -- was a well-executed volume ramp of our UR20 collaborative robot. We delivered more than 300 units in Q3 and we expect to deliver a multiple of that in Q4. The UR20 extends UR\u2019s ease-of-use and quick ROI to higher payload and longer reach applications, expanding the market in many segments. The strongest segments for UR20 so far are welding and pelletizing. The distribution channel transformation that we described in the -- in past calls is also making steady progress. Complementing our existing distribution channels with direct coverage at large accounts and adding OEM partners is a long-term project and we're beginning to see positive benefits. For example, in the OEM space, we've added 48 new OEM partners so far in 2023, bringing the total to 144. And we've seen direct OEM orders grow nearly 20%, driven by the high demand from the pelletizing market. At MiR, our account strategy continues to deliver with our top 10 customers, expanding their collective installed base by over 15% year-to-date, a rank that's more than 50% greater than the overall install base growth. Shifting to the future, I'd like to describe our current thinking about 2024. Please bear in mind that it is still too early and visibility is too limited to be certain about what will happen next year. However, there are some longer-term trends that we expect to play out. As we previously discussed, we expect the SOC market and our revenue to grow from 2023 on broader 3-nanometer adoption in the mobility space, driving market growth and continued to strength in the compute market. The real question is the magnitude of the mobility recovery, which depends on smartphone unit growth, complexity growth and how quickly the industry can consume idle test capacity. For reference, we estimate subcon tester utilization is still low, up only marginally from our July estimate and well below the typical Q2 to Q3 increase. The automotive test market has been sustaining at a higher level in 2023 than we originally expected. It appears that channel inventories in automotive are stabilizing and we have some -- seen some spot weakness in the market. We aren't expecting a significant change in the full-year market size next year, as unit forecasts and semiconductor attach rates, driven by the cross-over from internal combustion to EV remain bullish. The technology buys that have supported the memory TAM in 2023 should continue into next year and we expect the memory market to grow as HBM, DDR5 and LPDDR5 penetration expands to support AI and computing growth. In flash, as the protocol interface speeds continue to increase, we expect flash package test demand to grow as well. Overall, we expect the total ATE TAM to be up modestly from this year and the key factor is the strength in -- of recovery in mobile. Growth in our wireless business, LitePoint, will be strongly linked to handset growth, a recovery in the PC market and the start of the rollout of Wi-Fi 7. The supply-demand imbalance in HDD is likely to persist through 2024 and we expect HDD test to remain weak. System-level test will depend largely on smartphone unit growth in the near-term while we expect our defense and aerospace business to grow in 2024 on increased defense investments worldwide. In Robotics, we're finishing 2023 on a positive note in a tough market, with Q4 revenues up about 10% year-on year on the strength of the new UR20 product introduction. That performance reinforces our optimism in Robotics. We see Robotics as a marathon, not a sprint. We are serving in a mark -- an emerging market of $2 billion this year that we expect to grow to tens of billions of dollars per year in the future. Our operating model for Robotics is built for that marathon, with a strategy that prioritizes product and support investments that deliver value to customers now. We are counting on building relationships with those paying customers to help guide our ongoing investments to meet their evolving needs for the future. The key to this strategy is driving towards our model of 5% to 15% profit from our Robotics portfolio. While we may -- while we will fall short of this objective in 2023, it remains a key operating metric for 2024. We do this to ensure that we remain focused on our customers' most important automation priorities while we grow the business. Rolling it all up, 2024 looks to be stronger than 2023, with all of the uncertainty around chip inventories, low utilization rates and macroeconomic worries. I call it incrementally stronger, but we'll get a better view over the next quarter or so. We're also assuming a quarterly revenue profile in 2024, similar to 2023, with Q1 as the low-point and then growth from there. While early, we're modeling Q1 sales to be similar to Q1 2023. As we finish the year, I'm encouraged by indications that our largest market, semi test, appears to have troughed in 2023 at a level that delivers an operating profit of 20% for the total company. We are confident about the long-term growth outlook of semi -- of the semiconductor market, as the substantial fab equipment investments made in the recent past have not yet seen matching test investments. Also, we see consistent investment in tooling to enable continued process development, whether it is building a family of process nodes at 3 nanometer or enabling gate all around and two-nanometer technologies. While the timing of test investments will be driven by end-market chip demand and complexity growth, we are confident that this investment will happen. To be clear, our customers are still cautious about their near-term demand and we're reflecting that caution in our initial outlook for next year. But long-term, there is significant upside potential. In Robotics, we have a pipeline of new products, new applications and distribution changes that are now beginning to yield. At the end of the day, the global population trends are inarguable. The long-term demand for advanced automation must grow to deal with the increasing shortage of manufacturing workers. That coupled with market conditions that favor low-cost, short-ROI automation investments and our team's growing execution skill, I expect renewed growth in Robotics in 2024 as well. With that, I'll turn things over to Sanjay for the financial details. Sanjay?\nSanjay Mehta: Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover the financial summary of Q3, provide our Q4 outlook and update you on our supply chain and resiliency progress. Now to Q3, third quarter sales were $704 million with non-GAAP EPS of $0.80, both at the high-end of our guidance as Robotics delivered above plan and some supply constraints eased in Test. Non-GAAP gross margins were 56.6%, in line with our guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $243 million, down about 3% from the second quarter on spending controls and lower variable compensation. Non-GAAP operating profit rate was 22%. We had two 10% customers in the quarter. The tax rate excluding discrete items for the quarter was 14.5% on a GAAP basis and 15.7% on a non-GAAP basis. Semi test revenue for the quarter was $498 million, with SOC revenue contributing $404 million and memory $94 million. As noted earlier, we continue to see strength in SOC concentrated in auto end-market and image sensor parts of our business in the quarter. Memory sales continue to be weighted towards technology retooling for higher-speed protocol flash for smartphones, DDR5 and HBM DRAM for server applications. System Test Group revenue was $83 million, with $38 million in storage test, as SLT in HDD production demand remains muted. In wireless test, revenue was $37 million in Q3, with low demand from both PC and smartphone end-markets. We expect this market trend to continue over the next several quarters. Now to Robotics, revenue in Q3 was $86 million with UR contributing $71 million and MiR $15 million, which was above plan, as Greg noted. Shifting back to the company-level financials. Our free-cash flow was $140 million in the quarter and we returned 97% to shareholders. We repurchased $119 million of shares in the quarter, paid $17 million in dividends and settled $9 million of debt. We have the final $24 million of convertible debt, which will be repaid in the fourth quarter. We ended the quarter with $820 million in cash and marketable securities. Now, to our outlook for Q4. Q4 sales are expected to be between $640 million and $700 million, with non-GAAP EPS in a range of $0.61 to $0.81 on a 162 million diluted shares. Fourth quarter guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles, restructuring and other charges. This outlook is in line with our July view at the company level for the second half. Our revenue guide for Q4 has no material supply constraints. As supply has become more in line with demand, we are now back to including normal supply issues in the revenue range. As a result of supply and demand coming into balance, our lead times continue to improve. This enables customers to place orders more in line with our incremental production requirements. In Q4, there is a component of this behavior, but we expect to see more book-ship variability in Q1, as lead times continue to be reduced. Fourth quarter gross margins are estimated at 56% to 57%. OpEx is expected to run at 35% to 38% of fourth quarter sales, in line with Q3. Non-GAAP operating profit rate at the midpoint of our fourth quarter guidance is 20%. A little more color on gross margins and OpEx profile for the second half. Recall, our long-term model has gross margins at 59% to 60%. In 2021 and 2022, we were in our model range, with margins of 59.6% and 59.2% respectively. In our July call, we noted the gross margin profile by quarter, which show lower gross margins in Q3 and Q4 due to the timing of spending to strengthen our supply chain but that we expected our full-year 2023 gross margins in the 57% to 58% range. That outlook is unchanged. Turning to resiliency spending, in our operations, manufacturing spend will continue in Q4 but the spend associated with enabling our new factories to be qualified and producing testers is behind us. Packing up inventory and some capital equipment from old locations is what is left to do for our manufacturing in Q4. In short, we have successfully completed our objectives of moving many product lines to new locations. I would like to thank our internal teams and our partners for their tireless effort in de-risking our supply chain. Some component qualification will continue in 2024, but the majority of the test operational resiliency spending is behind us. Regarding OpEx, as noted, our full-year spend will be flat to slightly down versus 2022 spend levels. This is due to both spending controls and lower variable compensation. Recall our operating model has a variable component for operating expenses where the model flexes compensation expense with revenue and profits. As both are lower than 2022 levels, we're spending less than 2023. As revenues are expected to grow in 2024 and future years, that variable compensation component will also grow. For the full-year 2023, at the midpoint of our guidance, revenue will be slightly below $2.7 billion with non-GAAP EPS of $2.85 and operating profit of 20%. Gross margin for the full year should be about 57.5%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are forecasted to be 15.75% and 16.5% respectively in 2023. Looking at 2024 business levels. Greg noted we expected revenue growth in 2024. How much growth is tough to call at this point. Starting the year with Q1 2024 revenues, similar to Q1 2023 levels, Q1 is expected to have unfavorable product mix yielding lower gross margins than Q4 2023. For the full-year 2024, we expect gross margins to be better than \u201823 on higher volume and lower resiliency spending. Summing up, our second half is playing out as expected with the highlight being strong execution by our UR team, as they ramp UR20 to meet high customer demand. For the full-year, while the end markets have softened in 2023, our company operating model has flex cost down to support profitability while enabling our R&D and go-to-market investments to support our long-term growth objectives. We've transformed our supply chain to reduce geographic risk and strengthened our operations capacity. From a shareholder return perspective, year-to-date, we've returned 181% of our free cash flow to owners. Our cash position and strength in our balance sheet enables us to continue to invest in strategic organic initiatives and has the firepower to support a wide range of M&A options for inorganic growth in the future. With that, I'll turn the call back to Andy. Andy?\nAndy Blanchard: Thanks, Sanjay. Operator, we'd now like to take some questions. And as a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tim Arcuri with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nTim Arcuri: Thanks a lot. Greg, you had talked about there being some critical points where utilization has to get to, to then see mobility start to grow again. So how do you think about where we are sort of in aggregate? I know your large customer has their own dynamics. But how do you think about where we are right now in terms of utilization versus where you think we have to get until before the non-large customers would come back and start to buy again?\nGreg Smith: Yeah. That's -- thanks, Tim. So the -- right now, our -- I'm hesitant to give you exact numbers because our measurements of utilization are indirect. So we tend to look more at the changes from quarter-to-quarter than the absolute level. But they are significantly lower than what we've seen for people to want to buy. So -- and there's also a big difference between our IDM customers and our OSAT customers. So our IDM customer utilization by our measurements are up in the low 80s, and that's usually at a high enough level that trigger buys. Our OSAT customers are like 20 points lower, there's usually a few points of inflection, like an increase in utilization from Q2 to Q3, we saw very little in our data this time. And so it's still on the order of 20 points lower than what we're seeing inside of IDMs. So I think there's a pretty big hill to climb in terms of utilization before that would trigger buys from OSATs to support the mobile space.\nTim Arcuri: Thanks a lot. And then as you think about your -- I mean I think a lot depends on your large customer next year. But as you think about -- you read some of the plans in terms of what they're planning to do and having a new chips throughout the entire product portfolio going from N3D to N3E, through the entire product portfolio, you do get 30% more transistor density. So it depends on the die size, obviously, but it does seem like there's going to be a fairly solid increase in transistors across the entire portfolio next year. So maybe can you just -- I'm not asking you to predict what happens with that large customer, but can you talk about sort of the things that you're watching to sort of determine whether you think that next year could be a good year for that customer or not?\nGreg Smith: Sure. So yeah, I'm -- I think we're both sort of working off of the same source data when it comes to like reading the tea leaves about this large customer. We don't really know what their product plans are. The things that we are watching for are how quickly 3-nanometer goes into their high-performance computing process -- products that the more of that product line that's on 3-nanometer, the more complexity there will be, and that's a tailwind towards loading. The next is what's the relationship between -- like how do they use the next-generation 3-nanometer process? Do they use that to try to decrease dye size and attack cost? Or do they use that to add features to sort of keep dye size the same, add a lot of complexity. So we're watching very closely to see how that plays out. And then the last is, if there's any change to the strategy of using the N-1 processor in the lower-end phone product line. If that changes, that compresses the period of time that they have to build the -- up chips, and that helps to drive peak loading. So we don't have information about that. We are -- so we're being pretty cautious in terms of how we model that going into the future. But there are -- like as you point out, there are a number of things that could drive some upside.\nTim Arcuri: Great, Greg. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nKrish Sankar: Yeah. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I\u2019ve chosen to -- first one is on next year outlook to follow up on an earlier question. Historically, your big customers come around April or May timeframe to confirm kind of like a [Tesla] (ph) outlook for the year. Was it a similar -- and it seems like that was a different pattern this year. Do you expect to go back to regular patterns next year? Or is it still too early to commit this call? And I have a follow-up.\nGreg Smith: So I think that they actually followed a familiar pattern this year. But what ended up happening in April, May was that they ended up meeting not a lot of additional capacity. So I think we've pointed out in prior calls that we expect that major customer to be less than 10% customer in 2023. But we haven't seen any significant change in the timing. The thing that we said in the prior call about this was we didn't see -- like, we didn't have demand confirmed in that April, May timeframe, but there was still some uncertainty about what their peak loading might be and whether they need additional capacity. And that played out the way it played out. So I think they're still on basically the same schedule.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Got it. Very helpful. And then a quick follow-up on the auto market. You said that it's been strong. We've seen some spot weakness, but still expected to grow or be strong in calendar '24. Is that purely because you think increasing in semi content is going to offset unit weakness? Is there anything else you're seeing in autos? Thank you.\nGreg Smith: No. So I think that what we're seeing in automotive is most of the players in that space, they're large IDMs and they all have significant capacity expansion projects in process. And they've -- and with the lead times that they have for front-end equipment and where our lead times were running, say, even six months ago, they needed to place orders way in advance. And as they're building out that capacity, they need to phase their deliveries so that it lines up with their commissioning. And -- so we've seen some rescheduling, but we haven't seen anything that we would consider to be a significant signal of demand change.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Please proceed with your question.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes, thank you. I have two follow-up. And I'm not going to ask you about how to forecast iPhone 16 builds for next year. But what I want to learn is, actually, I want to get an update on the compute end market. We all hear of more of an ASIC design ramping, hyperscalers ramping their own ASIC solution. By now, everyone has seen the Graviton and TPU in the headline. And in that context, what's the update on Teradyne\u2019s content market share? And I have a follow-up.\nGreg Smith: Okay. So right now, the computing market, if you -- like, just to sort of break it down, there are a couple of components of the compute market. There's end equipment PCs. That part is significantly weak and continues to be. Then there's cloud computing, and the thing that's driving cloud computing is really AI acceleration. The beneficiaries of that are GPUs and then hyperscalers doing their own silicon. There's definitely increase in the amount of bespoke silicon that's going in, but it's still dwarfed by sort of traditional GPU-driven accelerators at this point. The TAM, sort of the amount of testers that are being sold to support the hyperscalers is very -- it's not very consistent at this point. We had a big hit last year, from a revenue perspective, it's quieter this year, but we think that this is something that's going to play out over probably the next three or four years. So we're really looking at it in terms of socket wins. And right now, I can tell you that we are on track with socket wins. We have low share in traditional compute. We were aiming to try and win half and half, like half the battles we get into on hyperscalers, and that's about what we're doing this year, that we're winning half of the sockets that we are fighting for and the other guys winning the other half.\nMehdi Hosseini: Okay. And my follow-up has to do with your color on Q1, and I appreciate going out of your way to help us with the modeling. The midpoint implies 8% sequential decline. And SOCs has historically been the weakest in Q1. So should we assume that semi test SOC will be down by more than 8% and everything else would be down less than 8%?\nSanjay Mehta: Hi, Mehdi, it's Sanjay. Yeah. So the seasonality decline is really coming through, I would say, in robotics. Obviously, seasonality comes down. And then we're ramping UR20 Q3 and really Q4 that goes down to run rate. The other component of the decline in Q -- or the forecasted decline in Q1 is tied to storage, really the mobility of the end market and SLT. And from an SOC perspective, we're seeing that as roughly flattish at this point, Q4 to Q1. So those are really the drivers of what we see now. And as I said in my prepared remarks, I'll just remind you that we're seeing, as lead times come down, a lot more kind of book-ship and customers coming to us with incremental orders within lead time. So we're expecting to see kind of more bookings kind of at the tail end of Q4 for Q1 shipments. So there's a little bit more volatility there.\nMehdi Hosseini: Thank you. Very helpful.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I guess if I can follow up on the last question, maybe an -- actually, your response that you're getting the 50% of wins in the accelerated compute or sort of custom ASICs that you are targeting, can you share a bit more in terms of then when we start to think about that translating -- the win translating into revenue, when does that start to happen? And particularly, like, when you look at a pipeline building here, how does that revenue progression look like? And I have a follow-up.\nGreg Smith: Yeah. So right now, the noted characteristic of it is volatility year-on-year. Our model of it, though, is by the time you get out to sort of the 2026, 2027 timeframe, we expect that these vertically integrated producers are going to represent about $400 million to $500 million of the compute test TAM. And for reference, that's probably going to be on the order of 1/4 to 1/3 of the total compute TAM out in that timeframe.\nSamik Chatterjee: Got it. And then for my follow-up, I know you're talking about 2024 being a year of incremental growth, and there are lots of puts and takes here, but you're starting 1Q in line with 1Q '23 and when I look at consensus, it has you growing 20% for the year. So obviously, as a magnitude sort of overall difference in sort of where you're starting 1Q versus what consensus is expecting, any sort of thoughts around whether that's a realistic assumption? Or if that 20% growth were to be realized, what do you need to see in terms of sort of uplift, which quarter that needs to come through for you to be able to realize that kind of sort of strong growth through the year?\nSanjay Mehta: Yeah. I think that -- it's Sanjay. I think that Greg really outlined kind of the potential headwinds and tailwinds in 2024. So right now, the first half and given the limited visibility, especially in mobility, it still continues to look a little dampened or weaker. But from a model perspective, where we see '24 tailwinds are in compute, mobility and Robotics for 2024. And so that's where we do see the tailwinds. The question is, to what degree. And we've provided some transparency of what we know about in Q1. And we think that, that is the low point. We think we'll grow from there. It's tough to call right now how it appears to be for the rest of the year. And we'll provide an update in January with what we know.\nSamik Chatterjee: Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. First one on gross margins. Sanjay, could you remind us what drove second half gross margins lower than the first half? And what will drive overall '24 gross margins higher than '23?\nSanjay Mehta: Yeah. Good question. So it's a similar story to what I noted in July, Vivek. Fundamentally, it's product mix in the second half, and we deferred resiliency spending in operations really from first half to second half. And in the first half, we were focused on chasing and meeting customer demand. So some of our projects were deferred into the second half. So it's mainly mix as well as deferred resiliency spending from kind of first half to second half.\nGreg Smith: And at \u201924, why it would be better?\nSanjay Mehta: Sorry. Thank you. In 2024, really, I think if -- as we've noted in our prepared remarks, incremental volume. Incremental volume, product mix -- is a main driver of product mix. And then there's a bunch of other puts and takes. And as I've noted in my prepared remarks, we expect to see much of the operational resiliency costs behind us in '24.\nVivek Arya: Got it. And for my follow-up, Greg, I was hoping you could help us kind of square some of the more muted commentary from customers such as the Texas Instruments about industrial demand, not as much automotive but a lot more industrial demand. I think they said the industrial weakness is broadening. How correlated is that demand to what you see and what your UR business sees? Because you're noticing strength in UR, but when we look at folks such as TI or Analog Devices, they were talking about weakness on the industrial side. So how correlated have these two trends been historically? And what is the kind of the right read across?\nGreg Smith: So I think the answer to your question is not very. The business that we're in with UR and MiR tends to be -- it's a short lead time business. We tend to run with about four weeks of lead time and customers will use our stuff for smaller projects. Much of the rest of the industrial segment that TI and Infineon and ST are serving is towards much longer lead time projects. Some of our industrial robot competitors are working off of year-long backlogs and for process control equipment, it can be even longer than that. So what we tend to see is that the cycles of investment for advanced automation lag we do are actually a little bit out of phase with the cycles of investment for, say, factory building. And right now, we're seeing that there is significant weakness in orders for our peers in industrial automation compared to where they were a year ago. And we're actually stabilizing relative to them. And that kind of makes sense. They will build a factory, they'll start running in the factory, and then they will look at different tasks in the factory that could be automated using AMRs and cobots and then they'll make a subsequent investment to do that. So I think the answer to your question is that you can't really infer what's going to happen with our Robotics business based on the industrial semi trends.\nVivek Arya: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nToshiya Hari: Good morning. Thank you. My first question, I have two. But my first question on semi test lead times. Greg, where are they today? How much have they come in over the past couple of quarters? And over the next couple of quarters, where do you see them going? And when you talk about Q1 of '24 revenue being flat, year-over-year, I guess that's for the overall company. But within your SOC test business or semi test business, what percentage of Q1 revenue do you think will be turns business?\nGreg Smith: So I'll take the lead time, and then I'll pass it off for the percent of turns to Sanjay. The lead times, if you go back about a year, our lead times were running out past 26 weeks out to 39 weeks, we were way oversubscribed. And right now, we've managed to be able to tighten up the supply chain and get us to the point where our lead times are running in the 16-week timeframe, and we're aiming in the short term to get those down to something that's closer to 13 weeks. That's probably where we're going to be sitting. But again, that's sort of an average lead time. We will be maintaining some -- an ability to work within lead time for particular high-priority orders. And so going into a quarter, we will probably have a very good idea about the majority of our revenue but we will have some ability to do book-ship. And I don't know, we're scrambling through the papers to make sure we give you a good answer for the turns question here. It's actually kind of fun to watch. So have you gotten to the right page yet?\nSanjay Mehta: Sure. Yeah. Hi, a little bit of context. Obviously, with very long lead times, looking out a quarter we'd be mainly booked. And then there's always the rescheduling and stuff drops in and just the tactical kind of shifts back and forth. But overall, for the business, we see it at like 25%, 30% and then dropping down into semi test, that is in the 15% to 20% range, which we're now starting to see that, that kind of book-ship is starting to become a little bit more increasing and increasing over time. As we -- as you'd expect lead times coming down, people are going to place the orders when they believe they need them. And that's when we get the POs.\nToshiya Hari: That makes sense. Thank you. And then as my follow-up, a question on China. Your peers in WFE on the front-end side of things, they're seeing 40% to 50% of their revenue come from customers in China. I think your business peaked at about 20% China a couple of years ago, and I think the most recent quarter, you were in the low teens. With new customers and existing customers expanding capacity, is China a potentially a growth area for you guys with the time lag over the next, call it, 24 months? Or is there a reason to believe that your exposure there could stay low in given competition or what have you? Thank you.\nSanjay Mehta: Sure. Hi, it's Sanjay. I'll take kind of the first half and provide some context about our current China kind of revenue. And then maybe, Greg, if you want to take the second part of the potential growth competition. So just to provide in context, right, in 2022, 15% of our revenue is in China. In '23, year-to-date, we've got about 12% of our revenue from China. And that 12% -- about 1/4 of that 12% is really from Robotics, production board test and LitePoint. 75% is from our semi test group and about 60% of that semi test, I know a lot of percentages, but 60% of that 70% is from indigenous Chinese customers and 40% is from multinationals. So the indigenous component is roughly about 5% of our overall business really tied to semi test.\nGreg Smith: And so I'll talk a little bit about the growth trends. If you decompose the business that we have in China right now, probably the part of the segment that's heaviest investment for us is really in memory. And we expect that to continue to grow. There's significant capital investment, WFE investment going into memory in China, and we have very good exposure to that. And there's also a significant growth in analog and power for automotive and industrial in China, and we serve that segment very well with our Eagle Test platform. The biggest headwind that we have in China is we are unable to sell test equipment into Huawei. That's by US regulations. And frankly, that takes the biggest single chunk of the test TAM in China out of our -- off of the table for us. So we're in there. We have a great team in China. We're competing for all the business that we can go after. And so we're hoping to kind of hold and potentially grow from where we are.\nToshiya Hari: Thank you for the color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Chin with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nBrian Chin: Hi, there. Good morning. Thanks for letting us as a few questions. Greg, maybe taking your starting point, which is modest growth in the test TAM -- semiconductor test TAM next year in calendar '24. A couple of questions. What kind of market share gain might you expect given maybe the initial expected profile of test spending next year? And also what kind of semiconductor IC unit growth or demand underpins your initial forecast for next year?\nGreg Smith: So right now, when we roll it up, we think that our overall ATE share is probably going to be flat to slightly up next year. No dramatic shifts from where we are. And I think there may be a bit of a tailwind because if the -- and that will depend on sort of the strength of the mobility recovery. So that's probably the biggest x-factor in terms of where share goes. Now in terms of IC unit growth, I don't have the data at my fingertips in terms of what our current expectations are. I think it's typically -- I'm almost there. Yeah. So we're looking at -- probably -- yeah. So unit growth was actually down this year, and it's coming back slightly, but it will still be below the units back in 2022 by our best guess. So the thing that's really going on is even though the units will be sort of at or below the peak that they had in 2022, the complexity growth that's happened since 2022 will drive test capacity requirements.\nBrian Chin: Got it. Got it. And is there any particular end markets where you see that sort of that unit gap filled better in terms of the complexity increase?\nGreg Smith: I'm sorry, could you repeat that?\nBrian Chin: Thinking about sort of the high watermark semiconductor shipments in calendar '22, given some markets maybe won't retest that unit level. Where is the complexity increases or quality control increases big enough to sort of fill that gap?\nGreg Smith: Yeah. So the biggest lever there is the degree to which advanced processors move to 3-nanometer technology. So it's really in the digital space. There are some tailwinds as more of the compute segment moves towards chiplet-based design. That's about a 10% to 20% tailwind on the amount of test that's required. And another area that is -- that complexity really helps is the more complex devices that are going into an automotive environment, it has a much higher test threshold than other markets. So high-performance processors for ADAS applications, those have very high test intensity for the same number of transistors is the same thing going into a phone. So that's where we're really looking for some sort of a complexity tailwind, I guess.\nBrian Chin: Okay. Got it. Maybe for my second question then just -- and maybe for Sanjay. I know maybe January is when you guys like to sort of refresh your thinking the most in terms of forward financial targets, but given sort of the more subdued initial outlook for calendar '24, what is sort of your initial thinking in terms of the calendar '26 financial model?\nSanjay Mehta: Yeah. Great question. Every year, we go through a process where we go through a strategic planning process in Q4. It culminates with a review with our Board in January. And then we share an update to our earnings model. And we're just starting to go through that process now. So I think the first quick answer is, sit tight. We\u2019ll share that with you in January. But let me provide a little bit of color to your question. We still have conviction in the overall key drivers and fundamentals of the model in test and in Robotics. I think Greg talked a little bit about them, we've narrated them. So in the -- over the mid and long term, we have conviction. Obviously, in the short term, the visibility is very muted and very cautious. And so we're going through that now. We're looking for key indicators of when the inflections will occur. But fundamentally, we believe, over the mid and long term, we're going to get to those goals. The timing, we're going to work through and provide an update in January.\nBrian Chin: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nJoe Moore: Great. Thank you. You talked about a memory business that's being driven by speeds and kind of new standards, but we are seeing some volume pickup there. So I'm wondering, are you seeing test utilizations in memory that could drive business there at some point? And then some of your memory customers have underutilized their fabs. Any indication that, that supply comes back online?\nGreg Smith: Hi, this is Greg. Hey, Joe. How are you doing? The -- so we definitely are seeing that the market is being driven this year by technology-driven retool. So HBM, DDR5, LPDDR5 and next-generation protocols. The fundamentals in the memory market are getting better. So inventory levels are coming down a bit and production rates are going up. Right now, we haven't seen that reach a trigger to drive a large amount of capacity buys. But that is one of the tailwinds that we're expecting to help a little bit in 2024, that we don't expect it to be a dramatic increase, and we would expect it to be somewhat back-end loaded because there is a fair amount of capacity that needs to be loaded before they trigger more buys, but it's definitely a tailwind.\nJoe Moore: Great. And do you think that you can continue to gain share within memory given the transitions that are happening?\nGreg Smith: Well, we would love to. The thing that I can tell you is that our share in memory is highest in final test and we also tend to be a first mover that we have the capability to test next-generation standards and protocols, and that allows us to sort of capture more share in that part of the market. In the wafer sort part of the market that's driven really by capacity needs, there's less differentiation, less profit and more competitors. So what we tend to see is when we're in a technology-driven retooling cycle, our share tends to be high. And when we're in a much broader capacity add that our share would tend to go down a little bit. But we're always fighting and we do have share in the wafer sort space. It's just not as high as our share in the final test space.\nJoe Moore: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Steve Barger with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Barger: Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just going back to the robotics demand stabilizing, we are seeing some plateauing in some industrial markets but the long-term model appears unchanged for robotics. So as you target bigger customers, do they have more durable robots plans relative to smaller customers? Or what gives you confidence that you can get back on track to that mid-20% CAGR by 2026?\nGreg Smith: Hi, Steve. So, thanks for your question. Definitely, large customers are a very different sales process and application process than small customers and robotics. So in small customers, the sales cycle can be quite short but the level of repeat purchases tends to be low. What we're seeing is we increase our direct coverage of large accounts from robotics is that they work against annual planning cycles and they come up with sort of multi project plans that they will put you into or not. And so since we started assigning more salespeople into this space in 2023, we now have a pretty rich opportunity funnel but it takes longer to get through that funnel than it does with smaller customers. So we expect to see a much greater impact from large customers in '24 than we do in '23. At the same time, there's also a lag time associated with the build-out of our OEM channel. So just to remind you, when I say OEM, what I'm talking about is we'll sell a robot to someone who has developed a repeatable solution, whether it's for adhesive application or welding or palletizing, they basically have a product that has our robot inside of it. And then they have their own sales and marketing and service to take care of distribution and customer service. So we signed up 48 new partners in 2023. Those partners have to go through that development process and build out their own distribution. So what we see is that, not all of the OEMs succeed. There's a certain percentage that do, and they tend to have an inflection about 18 to 24 months after the initial sign-up. So we'll -- we have sign-ups that have come from 2021 and 2022 that have inflected and are about to inflect. The ones that we signed up in 2023 are going to become a factor towards the end of '24 and into '25.\nSteve Barger: So if I can summarize that, that longer selling cycle could help mitigate the cyclicality of the underlying markets just because of that length? Is that fair?\nGreg Smith: It's fair. There's still cyclicality because big companies have lean times and investment times as well. So they sort of follow these PMI cycles a bit, but they work on longer lead times. The thing that I think we're looking at long term as a key way to reduce revenue volatility is to try to increase the amount of software and service revenue as part of our robotics business. So we're working to try and make sure that we can develop some recurring revenue streams in that space. And we think that, that will have a good effect. Not immediately, but by the end of this -- by sort of the '26, '27 timeframe.\nSteve Barger: And so that's a good segue to a quick follow-up. You mentioned being ready to execute M&A if something makes sense, which I don't recall being a big topic the past few quarters. Are you thinking more about that? And where would you focus on that across the portfolio?\nGreg Smith: So we're always thinking about M&A. So the -- just to remind you, our capital allocation strategy is that accretive M&A is the highest priority identified use for capital. When we do not find suitable M&A targets, we return that cash flow to our investors, primarily through buybacks. And of course, we have the dividend as well. We always have a pipeline running. We're always looking at things, and we don't comment on what's in our pipeline.\nSteve Barger: Got it. Thanks.\nAndy Blanchard: All right, operator, we're about out of time. So I'd like to just thank everybody for joining. And if you have questions, please reach out directly to me, Andy Blanchard. Take care and look forward to talking to you over the weeks ahead. Bye-bye.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Sanjay Mehta",
            "content": "Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover the financial summary of Q3, provide our Q4 outlook and update you on our supply chain and resiliency progress. Now to Q3, third quarter sales were $704 million with non-GAAP EPS of $0.80, both at the high-end of our guidance as Robotics delivered above plan and some supply constraints eased in Test. Non-GAAP gross margins were 56.6%, in line with our guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $243 million, down about 3% from the second quarter on spending controls and lower variable compensation. Non-GAAP operating profit rate was 22%. We had two 10% customers in the quarter. The tax rate excluding discrete items for the quarter was 14.5% on a GAAP basis and 15.7% on a non-GAAP basis. Semi test revenue for the quarter was $498 million, with SOC revenue contributing $404 million and memory $94 million. As noted earlier, we continue to see strength in SOC concentrated in auto end-market and image sensor parts of our business in the quarter. Memory sales continue to be weighted towards technology retooling for higher-speed protocol flash for smartphones, DDR5 and HBM DRAM for server applications. System Test Group revenue was $83 million, with $38 million in storage test, as SLT in HDD production demand remains muted. In wireless test, revenue was $37 million in Q3, with low demand from both PC and smartphone end-markets. We expect this market trend to continue over the next several quarters. Now to Robotics, revenue in Q3 was $86 million with UR contributing $71 million and MiR $15 million, which was above plan, as Greg noted. Shifting back to the company-level financials. Our free-cash flow was $140 million in the quarter and we returned 97% to shareholders. We repurchased $119 million of shares in the quarter, paid $17 million in dividends and settled $9 million of debt. We have the final $24 million of convertible debt, which will be repaid in the fourth quarter. We ended the quarter with $820 million in cash and marketable securities. Now, to our outlook for Q4. Q4 sales are expected to be between $640 million and $700 million, with non-GAAP EPS in a range of $0.61 to $0.81 on a 162 million diluted shares. Fourth quarter guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles, restructuring and other charges. This outlook is in line with our July view at the company level for the second half. Our revenue guide for Q4 has no material supply constraints. As supply has become more in line with demand, we are now back to including normal supply issues in the revenue range. As a result of supply and demand coming into balance, our lead times continue to improve. This enables customers to place orders more in line with our incremental production requirements. In Q4, there is a component of this behavior, but we expect to see more book-ship variability in Q1, as lead times continue to be reduced. Fourth quarter gross margins are estimated at 56% to 57%. OpEx is expected to run at 35% to 38% of fourth quarter sales, in line with Q3. Non-GAAP operating profit rate at the midpoint of our fourth quarter guidance is 20%. A little more color on gross margins and OpEx profile for the second half. Recall, our long-term model has gross margins at 59% to 60%. In 2021 and 2022, we were in our model range, with margins of 59.6% and 59.2% respectively. In our July call, we noted the gross margin profile by quarter, which show lower gross margins in Q3 and Q4 due to the timing of spending to strengthen our supply chain but that we expected our full-year 2023 gross margins in the 57% to 58% range. That outlook is unchanged. Turning to resiliency spending, in our operations, manufacturing spend will continue in Q4 but the spend associated with enabling our new factories to be qualified and producing testers is behind us. Packing up inventory and some capital equipment from old locations is what is left to do for our manufacturing in Q4. In short, we have successfully completed our objectives of moving many product lines to new locations. I would like to thank our internal teams and our partners for their tireless effort in de-risking our supply chain. Some component qualification will continue in 2024, but the majority of the test operational resiliency spending is behind us. Regarding OpEx, as noted, our full-year spend will be flat to slightly down versus 2022 spend levels. This is due to both spending controls and lower variable compensation. Recall our operating model has a variable component for operating expenses where the model flexes compensation expense with revenue and profits. As both are lower than 2022 levels, we're spending less than 2023. As revenues are expected to grow in 2024 and future years, that variable compensation component will also grow. For the full-year 2023, at the midpoint of our guidance, revenue will be slightly below $2.7 billion with non-GAAP EPS of $2.85 and operating profit of 20%. Gross margin for the full year should be about 57.5%. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are forecasted to be 15.75% and 16.5% respectively in 2023. Looking at 2024 business levels. Greg noted we expected revenue growth in 2024. How much growth is tough to call at this point. Starting the year with Q1 2024 revenues, similar to Q1 2023 levels, Q1 is expected to have unfavorable product mix yielding lower gross margins than Q4 2023. For the full-year 2024, we expect gross margins to be better than \u201823 on higher volume and lower resiliency spending. Summing up, our second half is playing out as expected with the highlight being strong execution by our UR team, as they ramp UR20 to meet high customer demand. For the full-year, while the end markets have softened in 2023, our company operating model has flex cost down to support profitability while enabling our R&D and go-to-market investments to support our long-term growth objectives. We've transformed our supply chain to reduce geographic risk and strengthened our operations capacity. From a shareholder return perspective, year-to-date, we've returned 181% of our free cash flow to owners. Our cash position and strength in our balance sheet enables us to continue to invest in strategic organic initiatives and has the firepower to support a wide range of M&A options for inorganic growth in the future. With that, I'll turn the call back to Andy. Andy? Hi, Mehdi, it's Sanjay. Yeah. So the seasonality decline is really coming through, I would say, in robotics. Obviously, seasonality comes down. And then we're ramping UR20 Q3 and really Q4 that goes down to run rate. The other component of the decline in Q -- or the forecasted decline in Q1 is tied to storage, really the mobility of the end market and SLT. And from an SOC perspective, we're seeing that as roughly flattish at this point, Q4 to Q1. So those are really the drivers of what we see now. And as I said in my prepared remarks, I'll just remind you that we're seeing, as lead times come down, a lot more kind of book-ship and customers coming to us with incremental orders within lead time. So we're expecting to see kind of more bookings kind of at the tail end of Q4 for Q1 shipments. So there's a little bit more volatility there. Yeah. I think that -- it's Sanjay. I think that Greg really outlined kind of the potential headwinds and tailwinds in 2024. So right now, the first half and given the limited visibility, especially in mobility, it still continues to look a little dampened or weaker. But from a model perspective, where we see '24 tailwinds are in compute, mobility and Robotics for 2024. And so that's where we do see the tailwinds. The question is, to what degree. And we've provided some transparency of what we know about in Q1. And we think that, that is the low point. We think we'll grow from there. It's tough to call right now how it appears to be for the rest of the year. And we'll provide an update in January with what we know. Yeah. Good question. So it's a similar story to what I noted in July, Vivek. Fundamentally, it's product mix in the second half, and we deferred resiliency spending in operations really from first half to second half. And in the first half, we were focused on chasing and meeting customer demand. So some of our projects were deferred into the second half. So it's mainly mix as well as deferred resiliency spending from kind of first half to second half. Sorry. Thank you. In 2024, really, I think if -- as we've noted in our prepared remarks, incremental volume. Incremental volume, product mix -- is a main driver of product mix. And then there's a bunch of other puts and takes. And as I've noted in my prepared remarks, we expect to see much of the operational resiliency costs behind us in '24. Sure. Yeah. Hi, a little bit of context. Obviously, with very long lead times, looking out a quarter we'd be mainly booked. And then there's always the rescheduling and stuff drops in and just the tactical kind of shifts back and forth. But overall, for the business, we see it at like 25%, 30% and then dropping down into semi test, that is in the 15% to 20% range, which we're now starting to see that, that kind of book-ship is starting to become a little bit more increasing and increasing over time. As we -- as you'd expect lead times coming down, people are going to place the orders when they believe they need them. And that's when we get the POs. Sure. Hi, it's Sanjay. I'll take kind of the first half and provide some context about our current China kind of revenue. And then maybe, Greg, if you want to take the second part of the potential growth competition. So just to provide in context, right, in 2022, 15% of our revenue is in China. In '23, year-to-date, we've got about 12% of our revenue from China. And that 12% -- about 1/4 of that 12% is really from Robotics, production board test and LitePoint. 75% is from our semi test group and about 60% of that semi test, I know a lot of percentages, but 60% of that 70% is from indigenous Chinese customers and 40% is from multinationals. So the indigenous component is roughly about 5% of our overall business really tied to semi test. Yeah. Great question. Every year, we go through a process where we go through a strategic planning process in Q4. It culminates with a review with our Board in January. And then we share an update to our earnings model. And we're just starting to go through that process now. So I think the first quick answer is, sit tight. We'll share that with you in January. But let me provide a little bit of color to your question. We still have conviction in the overall key drivers and fundamentals of the model in test and in Robotics. I think Greg talked a little bit about them, we've narrated them. So in the -- over the mid and long term, we have conviction. Obviously, in the short term, the visibility is very muted and very cautious. And so we're going through that now. We're looking for key indicators of when the inflections will occur. But fundamentally, we believe, over the mid and long term, we're going to get to those goals. The timing, we're going to work through and provide an update in January."

            "name": "Greg Smith",
            "content": "Thanks, Andy, and good morning everyone. Today, I will summarize our Q3 results, describe the current business conditions and provide some insight on how we're thinking about 2024 and beyond. Sanjay will then provide the financial details on Q3, our outlook for Q4 and offer some comments on modeling next year. Third quarter sales and earnings were at the high end of our guidance range, as Robotics sales came in above plan and we cleared some supply constraints and tests. The second half of 2023 is playing out as we described in July. We expect to close out the year with strong Robotics shipments, amplified by new product shipments at UR and seasonally softer test shipments. In semiconductor test, the mobility correction cycle persists and shipments remain well below historic levels while our automotive test shipments remained high in Q3. Memory test shipments in Q3 were down sequentially due to the timing of shipments, but demand remained strong. LPDDR5 and HBM, both of which require higher-speed testers, drove the results. In wireless, demand remained muted in the quarter, given the weak smartphone market and lack of new wireless standards this year. In system test, defense and aerospace, and storage test groups were unplanned while production board tests softened in the quarter. Robotics demand has stabilized. In the first half of 2023, demand was quite low, down 21% versus the first half of 2022. In Q3, demand strengthened, with revenue nearly at 2022 levels and up 20% from Q2. Our shipments have stepped-up, as we execute an aggressive ramp of the new UR20 product and PMI seems to have stabilized a bit. Looking at the full-year of 2023, our estimates of the SOC test market size are unchanged at $3.7 billion to $4.1 billion, down about 15% at the midpoint from last year. The weakest segment of SOC is mobility, down about 40% from 2022 on slower complexity growth in smartphone semiconductors and year-on decline in units. The compute, automotive and industrial analog segments of the market will finish the year at similar levels to 2022. In memory test, we expect the market will be get the low end of the $900 million to $1 billion range, also unchanged from our July view. The demand for high-speed DRAM test remains high, as we close out 2023, which will help us tick-up a few points of memory share for the full year. Teradyne's System Test Group will finish 2023 downward than 20% from 2022. Within this group, we expect defense and aerospace will grow 10% year-on-year, as global defense spending ticked up. The other segments of the business were negatively impacted by over-supply in the HDD market and mobility weakness. Shifting now to Robotics. The macro environment for industry is incrementally better than last quarter, with global PMI stable or improving slightly. The highlight of the quarter is -- was a well-executed volume ramp of our UR20 collaborative robot. We delivered more than 300 units in Q3 and we expect to deliver a multiple of that in Q4. The UR20 extends UR's ease-of-use and quick ROI to higher payload and longer reach applications, expanding the market in many segments. The strongest segments for UR20 so far are welding and pelletizing. The distribution channel transformation that we described in the -- in past calls is also making steady progress. Complementing our existing distribution channels with direct coverage at large accounts and adding OEM partners is a long-term project and we're beginning to see positive benefits. For example, in the OEM space, we've added 48 new OEM partners so far in 2023, bringing the total to 144. And we've seen direct OEM orders grow nearly 20%, driven by the high demand from the pelletizing market. At MiR, our account strategy continues to deliver with our top 10 customers, expanding their collective installed base by over 15% year-to-date, a rank that's more than 50% greater than the overall install base growth. Shifting to the future, I'd like to describe our current thinking about 2024. Please bear in mind that it is still too early and visibility is too limited to be certain about what will happen next year. However, there are some longer-term trends that we expect to play out. As we previously discussed, we expect the SOC market and our revenue to grow from 2023 on broader 3-nanometer adoption in the mobility space, driving market growth and continued to strength in the compute market. The real question is the magnitude of the mobility recovery, which depends on smartphone unit growth, complexity growth and how quickly the industry can consume idle test capacity. For reference, we estimate subcon tester utilization is still low, up only marginally from our July estimate and well below the typical Q2 to Q3 increase. The automotive test market has been sustaining at a higher level in 2023 than we originally expected. It appears that channel inventories in automotive are stabilizing and we have some -- seen some spot weakness in the market. We aren't expecting a significant change in the full-year market size next year, as unit forecasts and semiconductor attach rates, driven by the cross-over from internal combustion to EV remain bullish. The technology buys that have supported the memory TAM in 2023 should continue into next year and we expect the memory market to grow as HBM, DDR5 and LPDDR5 penetration expands to support AI and computing growth. In flash, as the protocol interface speeds continue to increase, we expect flash package test demand to grow as well. Overall, we expect the total ATE TAM to be up modestly from this year and the key factor is the strength in -- of recovery in mobile. Growth in our wireless business, LitePoint, will be strongly linked to handset growth, a recovery in the PC market and the start of the rollout of Wi-Fi 7. The supply-demand imbalance in HDD is likely to persist through 2024 and we expect HDD test to remain weak. System-level test will depend largely on smartphone unit growth in the near-term while we expect our defense and aerospace business to grow in 2024 on increased defense investments worldwide. In Robotics, we're finishing 2023 on a positive note in a tough market, with Q4 revenues up about 10% year-on year on the strength of the new UR20 product introduction. That performance reinforces our optimism in Robotics. We see Robotics as a marathon, not a sprint. We are serving in a mark -- an emerging market of $2 billion this year that we expect to grow to tens of billions of dollars per year in the future. Our operating model for Robotics is built for that marathon, with a strategy that prioritizes product and support investments that deliver value to customers now. We are counting on building relationships with those paying customers to help guide our ongoing investments to meet their evolving needs for the future. The key to this strategy is driving towards our model of 5% to 15% profit from our Robotics portfolio. While we may -- while we will fall short of this objective in 2023, it remains a key operating metric for 2024. We do this to ensure that we remain focused on our customers' most important automation priorities while we grow the business. Rolling it all up, 2024 looks to be stronger than 2023, with all of the uncertainty around chip inventories, low utilization rates and macroeconomic worries. I call it incrementally stronger, but we'll get a better view over the next quarter or so. We're also assuming a quarterly revenue profile in 2024, similar to 2023, with Q1 as the low-point and then growth from there. While early, we're modeling Q1 sales to be similar to Q1 2023. As we finish the year, I'm encouraged by indications that our largest market, semi test, appears to have troughed in 2023 at a level that delivers an operating profit of 20% for the total company. We are confident about the long-term growth outlook of semi -- of the semiconductor market, as the substantial fab equipment investments made in the recent past have not yet seen matching test investments. Also, we see consistent investment in tooling to enable continued process development, whether it is building a family of process nodes at 3 nanometer or enabling gate all around and two-nanometer technologies. While the timing of test investments will be driven by end-market chip demand and complexity growth, we are confident that this investment will happen. To be clear, our customers are still cautious about their near-term demand and we're reflecting that caution in our initial outlook for next year. But long-term, there is significant upside potential. In Robotics, we have a pipeline of new products, new applications and distribution changes that are now beginning to yield. At the end of the day, the global population trends are inarguable. The long-term demand for advanced automation must grow to deal with the increasing shortage of manufacturing workers. That coupled with market conditions that favor low-cost, short-ROI automation investments and our team's growing execution skill, I expect renewed growth in Robotics in 2024 as well. With that, I'll turn things over to Sanjay for the financial details. Sanjay? Yeah. That's -- thanks, Tim. So the -- right now, our -- I'm hesitant to give you exact numbers because our measurements of utilization are indirect. So we tend to look more at the changes from quarter-to-quarter than the absolute level. But they are significantly lower than what we've seen for people to want to buy. So -- and there's also a big difference between our IDM customers and our OSAT customers. So our IDM customer utilization by our measurements are up in the low 80s, and that's usually at a high enough level that trigger buys. Our OSAT customers are like 20 points lower, there's usually a few points of inflection, like an increase in utilization from Q2 to Q3, we saw very little in our data this time. And so it's still on the order of 20 points lower than what we're seeing inside of IDMs. So I think there's a pretty big hill to climb in terms of utilization before that would trigger buys from OSATs to support the mobile space. Sure. So yeah, I'm -- I think we're both sort of working off of the same source data when it comes to like reading the tea leaves about this large customer. We don't really know what their product plans are. The things that we are watching for are how quickly 3-nanometer goes into their high-performance computing process -- products that the more of that product line that's on 3-nanometer, the more complexity there will be, and that's a tailwind towards loading. The next is what's the relationship between -- like how do they use the next-generation 3-nanometer process? Do they use that to try to decrease dye size and attack cost? Or do they use that to add features to sort of keep dye size the same, add a lot of complexity. So we're watching very closely to see how that plays out. And then the last is, if there's any change to the strategy of using the N-1 processor in the lower-end phone product line. If that changes, that compresses the period of time that they have to build the -- up chips, and that helps to drive peak loading. So we don't have information about that. We are -- so we're being pretty cautious in terms of how we model that going into the future. But there are -- like as you point out, there are a number of things that could drive some upside. So I think that they actually followed a familiar pattern this year. But what ended up happening in April, May was that they ended up meeting not a lot of additional capacity. So I think we've pointed out in prior calls that we expect that major customer to be less than 10% customer in 2023. But we haven't seen any significant change in the timing. The thing that we said in the prior call about this was we didn't see -- like, we didn't have demand confirmed in that April, May timeframe, but there was still some uncertainty about what their peak loading might be and whether they need additional capacity. And that played out the way it played out. So I think they're still on basically the same schedule. No. So I think that what we're seeing in automotive is most of the players in that space, they're large IDMs and they all have significant capacity expansion projects in process. And they've -- and with the lead times that they have for front-end equipment and where our lead times were running, say, even six months ago, they needed to place orders way in advance. And as they're building out that capacity, they need to phase their deliveries so that it lines up with their commissioning. And -- so we've seen some rescheduling, but we haven't seen anything that we would consider to be a significant signal of demand change. Okay. So right now, the computing market, if you -- like, just to sort of break it down, there are a couple of components of the compute market. There's end equipment PCs. That part is significantly weak and continues to be. Then there's cloud computing, and the thing that's driving cloud computing is really AI acceleration. The beneficiaries of that are GPUs and then hyperscalers doing their own silicon. There's definitely increase in the amount of bespoke silicon that's going in, but it's still dwarfed by sort of traditional GPU-driven accelerators at this point. The TAM, sort of the amount of testers that are being sold to support the hyperscalers is very -- it's not very consistent at this point. We had a big hit last year, from a revenue perspective, it's quieter this year, but we think that this is something that's going to play out over probably the next three or four years. So we're really looking at it in terms of socket wins. And right now, I can tell you that we are on track with socket wins. We have low share in traditional compute. We were aiming to try and win half and half, like half the battles we get into on hyperscalers, and that's about what we're doing this year, that we're winning half of the sockets that we are fighting for and the other guys winning the other half. Yeah. So right now, the noted characteristic of it is volatility year-on-year. Our model of it, though, is by the time you get out to sort of the 2026, 2027 timeframe, we expect that these vertically integrated producers are going to represent about $400 million to $500 million of the compute test TAM. And for reference, that's probably going to be on the order of 1/4 to 1/3 of the total compute TAM out in that timeframe. And at '24, why it would be better? So I think the answer to your question is not very. The business that we're in with UR and MiR tends to be -- it's a short lead time business. We tend to run with about four weeks of lead time and customers will use our stuff for smaller projects. Much of the rest of the industrial segment that TI and Infineon and ST are serving is towards much longer lead time projects. Some of our industrial robot competitors are working off of year-long backlogs and for process control equipment, it can be even longer than that. So what we tend to see is that the cycles of investment for advanced automation lag we do are actually a little bit out of phase with the cycles of investment for, say, factory building. And right now, we're seeing that there is significant weakness in orders for our peers in industrial automation compared to where they were a year ago. And we're actually stabilizing relative to them. And that kind of makes sense. They will build a factory, they'll start running in the factory, and then they will look at different tasks in the factory that could be automated using AMRs and cobots and then they'll make a subsequent investment to do that. So I think the answer to your question is that you can't really infer what's going to happen with our Robotics business based on the industrial semi trends. So I'll take the lead time, and then I'll pass it off for the percent of turns to Sanjay. The lead times, if you go back about a year, our lead times were running out past 26 weeks out to 39 weeks, we were way oversubscribed. And right now, we've managed to be able to tighten up the supply chain and get us to the point where our lead times are running in the 16-week timeframe, and we're aiming in the short term to get those down to something that's closer to 13 weeks. That's probably where we're going to be sitting. But again, that's sort of an average lead time. We will be maintaining some -- an ability to work within lead time for particular high-priority orders. And so going into a quarter, we will probably have a very good idea about the majority of our revenue but we will have some ability to do book-ship. And I don't know, we're scrambling through the papers to make sure we give you a good answer for the turns question here. It's actually kind of fun to watch. So have you gotten to the right page yet? And so I'll talk a little bit about the growth trends. If you decompose the business that we have in China right now, probably the part of the segment that's heaviest investment for us is really in memory. And we expect that to continue to grow. There's significant capital investment, WFE investment going into memory in China, and we have very good exposure to that. And there's also a significant growth in analog and power for automotive and industrial in China, and we serve that segment very well with our Eagle Test platform. The biggest headwind that we have in China is we are unable to sell test equipment into Huawei. That's by US regulations. And frankly, that takes the biggest single chunk of the test TAM in China out of our -- off of the table for us. So we're in there. We have a great team in China. We're competing for all the business that we can go after. And so we're hoping to kind of hold and potentially grow from where we are. So right now, when we roll it up, we think that our overall ATE share is probably going to be flat to slightly up next year. No dramatic shifts from where we are. And I think there may be a bit of a tailwind because if the -- and that will depend on sort of the strength of the mobility recovery. So that's probably the biggest x-factor in terms of where share goes. Now in terms of IC unit growth, I don't have the data at my fingertips in terms of what our current expectations are. I think it's typically -- I'm almost there. Yeah. So we're looking at -- probably -- yeah. So unit growth was actually down this year, and it's coming back slightly, but it will still be below the units back in 2022 by our best guess. So the thing that's really going on is even though the units will be sort of at or below the peak that they had in 2022, the complexity growth that's happened since 2022 will drive test capacity requirements. I'm sorry, could you repeat that? Yeah. So the biggest lever there is the degree to which advanced processors move to 3-nanometer technology. So it's really in the digital space. There are some tailwinds as more of the compute segment moves towards chiplet-based design. That's about a 10% to 20% tailwind on the amount of test that's required. And another area that is -- that complexity really helps is the more complex devices that are going into an automotive environment, it has a much higher test threshold than other markets. So high-performance processors for ADAS applications, those have very high test intensity for the same number of transistors is the same thing going into a phone. So that's where we're really looking for some sort of a complexity tailwind, I guess. Hi, this is Greg. Hey, Joe. How are you doing? The -- so we definitely are seeing that the market is being driven this year by technology-driven retool. So HBM, DDR5, LPDDR5 and next-generation protocols. The fundamentals in the memory market are getting better. So inventory levels are coming down a bit and production rates are going up. Right now, we haven't seen that reach a trigger to drive a large amount of capacity buys. But that is one of the tailwinds that we're expecting to help a little bit in 2024, that we don't expect it to be a dramatic increase, and we would expect it to be somewhat back-end loaded because there is a fair amount of capacity that needs to be loaded before they trigger more buys, but it's definitely a tailwind. Well, we would love to. The thing that I can tell you is that our share in memory is highest in final test and we also tend to be a first mover that we have the capability to test next-generation standards and protocols, and that allows us to sort of capture more share in that part of the market. In the wafer sort part of the market that's driven really by capacity needs, there's less differentiation, less profit and more competitors. So what we tend to see is when we're in a technology-driven retooling cycle, our share tends to be high. And when we're in a much broader capacity add that our share would tend to go down a little bit. But we're always fighting and we do have share in the wafer sort space. It's just not as high as our share in the final test space. Hi, Steve. So, thanks for your question. Definitely, large customers are a very different sales process and application process than small customers and robotics. So in small customers, the sales cycle can be quite short but the level of repeat purchases tends to be low. What we're seeing is we increase our direct coverage of large accounts from robotics is that they work against annual planning cycles and they come up with sort of multi project plans that they will put you into or not. And so since we started assigning more salespeople into this space in 2023, we now have a pretty rich opportunity funnel but it takes longer to get through that funnel than it does with smaller customers. So we expect to see a much greater impact from large customers in '24 than we do in '23. At the same time, there's also a lag time associated with the build-out of our OEM channel. So just to remind you, when I say OEM, what I'm talking about is we'll sell a robot to someone who has developed a repeatable solution, whether it's for adhesive application or welding or palletizing, they basically have a product that has our robot inside of it. And then they have their own sales and marketing and service to take care of distribution and customer service. So we signed up 48 new partners in 2023. Those partners have to go through that development process and build out their own distribution. So what we see is that, not all of the OEMs succeed. There's a certain percentage that do, and they tend to have an inflection about 18 to 24 months after the initial sign-up. So we'll -- we have sign-ups that have come from 2021 and 2022 that have inflected and are about to inflect. The ones that we signed up in 2023 are going to become a factor towards the end of '24 and into '25. It's fair. There's still cyclicality because big companies have lean times and investment times as well. So they sort of follow these PMI cycles a bit, but they work on longer lead times. The thing that I think we're looking at long term as a key way to reduce revenue volatility is to try to increase the amount of software and service revenue as part of our robotics business. So we're working to try and make sure that we can develop some recurring revenue streams in that space. And we think that, that will have a good effect. Not immediately, but by the end of this -- by sort of the '26, '27 timeframe. So we're always thinking about M&A. So the -- just to remind you, our capital allocation strategy is that accretive M&A is the highest priority identified use for capital. When we do not find suitable M&A targets, we return that cash flow to our investors, primarily through buybacks. And of course, we have the dividend as well. We always have a pipeline running. We're always looking at things, and we don't comment on what's in our pipeline."

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Andy Blanchard, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Andy. You may begin.\nAndy Blanchard: Thank you, operator. And good morning, everyone, and welcome to our discussion of Teradyne\u2019s most recent financial results. I\u2019m joined this morning by our CEO, Greg Smith; and our CFO, Sanjay Mehta. Following our opening remarks, we\u2019ll provide details of our performance for 2023\u2019s second quarter, along with our outlook for the third quarter. Press release containing our second quarter results was issued last evening. We\u2019re providing slides on the Investor page of the website that may be helpful to you in following the discussion. Replays of this call will be available via the same page after the call ends. The matters that we discuss today will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause Teradyne\u2019s results to differ materially from management\u2019s current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor statement contained in the earnings release, as well as our most recent SEC filings. Additionally, those forward-looking statements are made as of today, and we take no obligation to update them as a result of developments occurring after this call. During today\u2019s call, we\u2019ll make reference to non-GAAP financial measures. We\u2019ve posted additional information concerning these non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure were available on the Investor page of the website. Looking ahead, between now and our next earnings call, Teradyne expects to participate in technology or industrial-focused investor conferences hosted by KeyBanc, Jefferies, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, Citi and Evercore ISI. Now let's get on with the rest of the agenda. First, Greg will comment on our recent results and the market conditions as we enter the third quarter. Sanjay will then offer more details on our quarterly results along with our guidance for the third quarter. We'll then answer your questions. This call is scheduled for one hour. Greg?\nGreg Smith: Thanks Andy, and good morning, everyone. Today, I\u2019ll summarize our Q2 and first half results. Comment on the current business conditions and our view of the second half. Sanjay will provide the financial details on Q2, our outlook for Q3 and offer some financial guide posts for the rest of the year. Second quarter sales were at the top our guidance range as supply constraints eased. Earnings were above our guide on higher gross margins. At the halfway point of the year, overall company performance has unfolded as expected but at the segment level, tester was incrementally stronger in robotics weaker. In semiconductor tester, we are four quarters into a correction cycle driven by excess inventory, which has hit the mobility part of the market hardest. Automotive demand has remained strong and in memory test, the growth of DDR5 and HBM devices for data center applications are driving retooling. In our wireless and system tests businesses, demand remains muted unchanged from our April view. Robotics demand has softened over the past three months with worsening PMIs and the short-term impacts of the transformation of the UR distribution channel. Looking forward to the rest of 2023, we estimate the 2023 SOC test market will be $3.7 billion to $4.1 billion, down 13% to 21% from 2022. But up from our outlook in April. The continued weakness in mobility has been offset by sustained strength in the automotive segment. Also since April, the accelerating build out of AI enabled cloud computing is driving test demand for compute and networking. In memory test, we expect the market will be at the low end of a $900 million to $1 billion range we described in April. In this market, the impact of AI is evident, especially in the HBM DRAM segment, where we see incrementally stronger test demand for Magnum products through the second half of 2023. Although HBM represents a small portion of the overall memory market, it is in a rapid growth phase, moving from under 5% of the test market last year to 10% to 15% of the market in 2023. And our HBM share is higher than our overall memory share. This technology driven strength is offset by weaker capacity buys, especially in Flash for mobile applications. Despite the current downturn, we remain confident about the future of the semiconductor test market. Primary growth driver is an insatiable demand for increasing device complexity. This can be seen in cloud and edge AI applications like ADAS systems, spatial computing and privacy focused consumer applications. These require enormous compute power, tireless higher wireless data rates, and more sophisticated power management. We expect the automotive tam will grow at a faster rate than the rest of the SOC market through this midterm, driven by the growth of EVs and hybrids, broader adoption of features such as ADAS, cabin lighting and infotainment, and the high test intensity required to achieve automotive quality levels. The trend of vertically integrated producers or VIPs is a fundamental disruption to the computing segment and is beneficial to Teradyne. Companies that provide cloud computing, cloud AI and edge AI are seeking to differentiate their solutions by taking control of chip design. Efforts that began a few years ago are now beginning to proliferate in data centers and vehicles and this trend will accelerate. Over the midterm we expect the VIP portion of the compute segment will grow faster than the overall compute segment, and our share will be higher than in traditional compute customers. The semiconductor industry has a process technology roadmap that supports these new more complex devices. Three nanometer is ramping now, and two nanometer and gate all around are coming soon. In advanced packaging, we see broader adoption of stack dye for high bandwidth memory and chiplets for processors. These new technologies will drive longer test times and retooling to test new interface standards. Rolling that all up our growth hypothesis for the semiconductor test market remains unchanged. A similar complexity roadmap drives our wireless and system test businesses. In Wireless Test, new standards like Wi Fi 60, and 7 require new or upgraded test equipment. In system test, increased device complexity is broadening the adoption of SLT and a very solid pipeline and defense and aerospace puts our system test group on a solid foundation for growth. Shifting to the Robotics portfolio, I want to take a moment to highlight that Ujjawal Kumar joined Teradyne earlier this month, as the new President of our Robotics Group, which includes UR and MiR. Ujjawal joins us from Honeywell, where he ran the process solutions business. His industrial automation and software background combined with the deep experience in building businesses through organic and inorganic growth across multiple end markets is a great addition for Teradyne. And we are delighted to have him join our leadership team. In the second quarter, robotics demand softened significantly. The trends that we noted in April have continued and intensified, challenging economic conditions, particularly low PMIs in Europe and the US have resulted in lower demand in our highest revenue regions. We have previously noted the channel transformation work at UR was having an impact on pipeline conversion. This trend has continued in Q2. Large accounts development and the build out of the OEM channel are progressing well, but not quickly enough to cover for the market softness in the quarter. With lead times under five weeks change in end market demand especially with our current high exposure to small and medium sized businesses is felt quickly. However, there is no shortage in interest in our human scale automation products. We saw record lead generation from two major automation trade shows in the quarter, but there's a clear reluctance from customers to place orders in the short term. As the result, we are now projecting full year revenue for our robotics group to be flat to down 10% from last year. Despite the difficult macro environment and the short term impact of our distribution changes, we believe that we will emerge from 2023 in a stronger position in robotics. On the new product front. We began shipments in the quarter of our higher payload longer reach UR20. Customers serving welding and metal fabrication and palletizing across a number of industrial verticals have driven demand for the UR20 and a triple digit unit backlog. We will see our first UR20 revenue in Q3 and ramped shipments through the second half. We also introduced MiR insights, a cloud based tool to enable near customers to monitor and optimize large fleets across multiple workflows and sites more effectively. We are transforming the UR distribution channel in 2023. Recall, we are complementing our existing distribution channel with direct touch coverage at large customers and adding OEM partners that have high long-term growth potential. In the short term, it appears this shift is slowing sales from distributors that were dependent on a high level of UR sales support. Longer term however, the change puts our focus on customers with the highest revenue potential. Although, these changes will take several quarters to yield, we're confident that we're on the right path. We've added 28 new OEM partners so far this year, and are working with our distribution partners to directly engage with over 200 large customers. At MiR, our focus on large accounts is yielding good results. This year, our installed base at large customers has grown 3x the rate of our overall installed base. We view robotics as a long-term opportunity. The market drivers are clear, aging populations, rising wages, labor shortage and the reshoring of production to reduce costs and cycle time. We have innovative market leading products serving a market that has the potential to grow to 10s of billions of dollars per year. Our customers have already demonstrated the value of our product and ecosystem in their operations. And they're partnering with us to extend our robots performance to expand the range of tasks they're planning to automate. Teradyne brings the foundational expertise and engineering operations and customer support needed to enable UR and MiR to become premier providers of human scale automation. We are putting the structure in place to support $1 billion in profitable sales by the end of the midterm. This is a long term project. But we are seeing the early signs of this work yielding. Wrapping it all up, our test businesses are performing better than planned through the first six months. And we expect that performance to continue through the second half. Automotive and memory our strongest markets in test this year. And a combination of inventory reductions and new products should enable the mobility market to recover next year. Our robotics business was below plan in the first half. And while we expect the stronger second half of the group, we expect to be the below our growth and financial plan for the full year. Our plans to transform our distribution and expand our product line are on track. We are carefully managing our spending in this business while we execute these changes. With that, I'll turn things over to Sanjay for the financial details. Sanjay?\nSanjay Mehta: Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone. Today I'll cover the financial summary of Q2, provide our Q3 outlook and full year planning assumptions. I will also update you on our supply chain and resiliency progress. Now to Q2. Second quarter sales were $684 million, which was at the high end of our guide with non-GAAP EPS $0.79, which was above our high guide of $0.74. Non- GAAP gross margins were 58.8%. Above our guidance due to deferred resiliency costs until later in the year and improved product mix. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $251 million flat with the first quarter. Non-GAAP operating profit was 22%. We had one 10% customer in the quarter. The tax rate excluding discrete items for the quarter was 16.5% on a GAAP basis and 17.2% on a non-GAAP basis. Semi test revenue for the quarter was $475 million with SOC revenue contributing $355 million and memory $120 million. As Greg noted, we continue to see SOC strength concentrated in the auto end market. Memory sales were weighted towards technology driven buys as the industry ramps new, higher speed devices like protocol Flash for smartphones, DDR5 and HBM DRAM for server applications. System test group Q2 revenue was $94 million with $38 million in storage test, which has been down all year on continued low SLT and HDD production demand. In Wireless Test, revenue was $44 million in Q2 with ongoing low demand from both PC and smartphone end markets. Now to robotics. Revenue in Q2 was $72 million with UR contributing $58 million and MiR $14 million, which was below plan as Greg noted. FX did not have a material impact on our top or bottom line results. Shifting back to the company level financials, our free cash flow was $104 million in the quarter. We repurchased $135 million of shares in the quarter, paid $17 million in dividends and settled $2 million of debt. We have $33 million of convertible debt remaining. We ended the quarter with $813 million in cash and marketable securities. Now to our outlook for Q3. Q3 sales are expected to be between $650 million and $710 million, with non-GAAP EPS in a range of $0.61 to $0.81on 163 million diluted shares. The third quarter guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles, and restructuring and other charges. This outlook is above our April view at the company level. But under the covers test is incrementally stronger, and robotics softer. Third quarter gross margins are estimated at 56% to 57%. OpEx is expected to run at 35% to 38% of third quarter sales down slightly from Q2. Non- GAAP operating profit rate at the midpoint of our third quarter guidance is 20%. A little more color on our revenue and gross margin profile for the second half. Our revenue guidance excludes approximately $35 million of test demand tied to supply constraints in Q3, which we expect to resolve in Q4. As a result, we expect Q4 revenue to be similar to the Q3 level. If we clear some of the supply constraints earlier. Some Q4 revenue and resulting profits will shift into Q3. That will put second half revenue at roughly 51% of the full year. Shifting to gross margins. Our long-term model has gross margins at 59% to 60%. In 2021 and 2022, we were in our model range with margins of 59.6% and 59.2% respectively. In April, we noted that we expected full year 2023 gross margins to be at 57% to 58% due in part to transitory costs of adding new manufacturing sites for our test products. Geographically multi sourcing components and sub-assemblies to reduce supply line risks. We're also developing multi country capability of some of our design services work. In past calls, we know that expected margins to be lowest in Q1 and improved through the year. However, the timing of these resiliency costs shifted to later in the year, which was a driver of outperformance on gross margin in Q1 and Q2. Since that spending will now happen in the second half, our margins in Q3 and Q4 will drop to reflect these costs. Net-net, we continue to expect 57% to 58% gross margins for the full year. However, some of these transitory resiliency costs have been deferred until the second half of the year. Regarding OpEx for the full year, no change from our prior guide as we expect full year 2023 OpEx to be roughly flat compared with 2022. Now to profitability for robotics for the full year. As Greg mentioned, we expect lower robotic sales for the year. Even at these reduced revenue levels. Robotics gross margins are above the corporate average. And while we expect UR to be profitable, the robotics group overall is now expected to have an operating loss for the year. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are forecasted to be 16.5% and 17% respectively, in 2023. Summing up, our stronger test businesses in Q2 more than balanced weaker robotic shipments, leading to sales at the high end of guidance with gross margin improvements yielding profits above our high guidance. We're executing our plan to improve the resiliency of our supply chain and engineering services. We're modeling full year gross margins in the 57% to 58% range in line with our April outlook and are on track to hold our full year OpEx flat with last year. We have a strong balance sheet to support organic and inorganic growth, while we continue returning excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. With that I'll turn the call back over to Andy. Andy?\nAndy Blanchard : Thanks, Sanjay. Operator would now like to take some questions and as a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and a follow up.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Tim Arcuri with UBS.\nTim Arcuri: Thanks a lot. I had a question on the revision of the TAM, SOC Tam. So you took it up about $300 million. Can you talk about where that's coming from? Is that all in autos? So autos go from six to nine this year? And then also in that you, I think you previously had said that your share would be in the kind of 38% to 39% range this year? Is that still the expectation even on this higher Tam?\nSanjay Mehta: Sure. Roughly at the midpoint, last time, we got to the SOC Tam, at the midpoint about 3.6. Now, obviously, it's Greg noted 3.7 to 4.1. So roughly a $300 million increase. And that's really tied to the compute market as a key driver. And there's we're rounding to hundreds of millions. So it's, but it's mainly in compute. And I would say, from a share perspective, our view on the full years that were roughly flat may tick a bit.\nTim Arcuri: Okay. Got it, then can you give a sense of just storage for the full year and sort of how you see that evolving next year? I think the expectation is still that it's going to be very soft in Q4. And then do you think that's going to rebounded to kind of get into the first part of next year?\nGreg Smith : So this is Greg. Yes, we think that storage is sort of running along at a minimal ship rate, we're going to expect to continue at that rate. And there might be a recovery in 2024. But I don't think it would be a first half thing. I think that there's still a fair amount of softness in the end market for HDD, a fair amount of oversupply. So it's really only when we're going to see significant capacity inflection when hammer comes online, and demand increases, that will drive higher test times and ultimately drive additional capacity purchases. But that's probably further out in time than the first half of next year.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Just going back to SOC Tam, want to get an update how you see the transistor density growth evolving into 2024. I remind you a couple of years ago, the SOC test was benefiting handsomely. And then we hit the pause. And I'm just trying to get an understanding of how the growth rate is evolving into next year. And I have a follow up.\nGreg Smith : Good morning, Mehdi, this is Greg. So the semiconductor process roadmap seems to be pretty much in line with what we saw before, perhaps a little bit of ramping three nanometer a little bit more slowly than we would have expected maybe back in 2020. But in terms of compared to recent events, it's pretty much on track. The key thing is that those complexity transitions are occurring in a market where end unit volumes, especially in mobile are significantly down. So even though the complexity increases are happening, and we are seeing sort of the expected changes in test time, there is a fair amount of idle capacity because of the unit declines that's being filled versus at driving new tester purchases. So I hope that answered your questions. But basically, we think that the pace of new process adoption is kind of going as we expected.\nMehdi Hosseini: Does that imply that the growth rate would accelerate in \u201824 or would remain the same?\nGreg Smith : So I think our view of 2024 is that the number of high volume three nanometer devices is definitely going to increase, so there'll be more chips on three nanometers. And the sort of third party reports that we see around end market is that it's up but not up dramatically. So I've seen numbers between 3% and 5% in terms of smartphone unit volume increases. So we definitely think that there's going to be three nanometer coming from more fabs, they're going to be more parts on three nanometers. And volumes are going to be up. So we think that 2024 is going to be incrementally stronger than 2023.\nOperator: Our next question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Greg, I think in the last call, you said test utilization in Q1, was kind of a generational low. Where do you think it is now? Because when I look at where consensus expectations are for Teradyne next year, they are for almost 25% growth. And I'm trying to understand when do you start to see the orders to justify those kinds of growth expectations if utilization still remains at these kinds of generational lows?\nGreg Smith : Good morning, Vivek. Thanks for the question. So the good news is that utilization hasn't gotten any worse. So tam it's up a bit so in the 2% to 5% increase in terms of utilization of Teradyne equipment. So our view is really of our own fleet, the thing that I will tell you is that there is a significant disparity in utilization between IDM and subcons. So, utilization inside of IDM is in the upper 80s. And that's well into the range where our customers are actively adding capacity. And that's really the strength that we see in automotive. In subcons, the utilization is nearly 20 points lower, but it is heading in the right direction. So I think it's a really good question in terms of how much that idle capacity will impact the size of business in 2024. So we are. that's sort of factored into our plans, we think 2024 would be stronger, but we really don't have a great idea about how much stronger it will be.\nVivek Arya: And then maybe one follow-up on the IA business, right? It's very innovative, the value proposition makes sense. But it has sort of consistently underperformed its potential, and I don't think it's ever been profitable. And I'm curious, what has been the disconnect? Is it really a structural growth business? Because it's actually declined two of the last four years? So what's been that disconnect? What will change in the future? And just kind of related to that do you think the competitive and pricing environment will be more or less favorable in that business for the next few years?\nGreg Smith : So it's a good question. The first thing that I'll point out is that the group has consistently underperformed our profit targets, it hasn't consistently lost money. So this is, I think this is really the first year where we're projecting a loss for that group. But you're right, we are in robotics for growth, and we're not delivering the growth that we expect it to from this from this business. And what we're really discovering is that there's a, f I'm going to sort of sum it up, we misunderstood how large the potential end market is, and how much the early years of those business was driven by very sophisticated early adopters, people that were like, robot enthusiast. And what we found is that as we satisfied those early enthusiasts and started moving into a larger market, where people were more focused on just buying a solution, that they didn't have the skills that they needed to put these robots into operation. So that's the logic behind our transformation in the channel at UR that by shifting more emphasis towards solution providers like OEMs, we're going to be able to provide solutions that are at the level of the capability of our customers. And by directly connecting to larger customers. Those are customers that have the heft to be able to maintain and implement the robots within their organizations. So I think that the thing that's that we're discovering is that the challenge in robotics isn't as much around technology as it is a go-to-market and a product market fit challenge. And we have a lot of evidence that our products do deliver value, we just are working out the best way to get them into the hands of our customers in a way that they're going to be able to easily adopt them.\nAndy Blanchard: Competitive environment.\nGreg Smith : Oh, yes. So thanks for the cue, Andy. So in terms of the competitive environment, the UR is a clear leader in its space, it has more than 3x the market share of our nearest competitor. And our shares in the mid-30s. We are, we see two kinds of competitors, industrial robot makers that are pivoting into Cobots. And sort of pure play cobot companies, mostly from China, we have not lost any significant share to the industrial robot players that have entered the cobot market in the past couple of years. But we have lost a few points of share to the Chinese pure play entrance. And almost all of that share losses specifically in China. So I said that our share was like mid-30s. worldwide, if you exclude China, our share worldwide is over 50% or around 50%. And it's much- much lower in China. And to be really frank, we are struggling with coming up with the best solution to gain share in China because a lot of that market is being served at prices that aren't profitable for us. And we're not really interested in growth at the expense of overall profitability. In AMRs, it's the Wild-Wild West, we have about the total AMR market is about $2 billion per year, and our share is probably in the range of about 3%. And we're in a crowd of a whole bunch of other companies that are in that 1% to 6% range. The thing there is that it's very fragmented, there's no clear leader and we are really working on trying to establish strategic relationships with global customers, because they're the ones that have the ability to adopt large fleets. So I think we see competition, but we believe that it's fragmented and will be able to outperform.\nOperator: Our next question is from C.J. Muse with Evercore ISI.\nC.J. Muse: Yes. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question, I was hoping you could speak in more detail around the $35 million shortage? Is that specific to auto? And I guess what would enable those revenues to come in earlier in Q3?\nSanjay Mehta: Sure. Hi, it\u2019s Sanjay, thanks for the question. I'd say spread across the entire semi test portfolio across many of the product lines. And the supply shortages are, as I've noted, in the past, really tied to analog and linear logic, a couple of other items, but those are the ones that as we're working with our supply chain partners to supply comes online to enable that. And so right now, it's excluded from the range. And we're trying to be transparent, just as we have over the last couple of years. And I just want to be clear that if that does come out of Q4, and is provided into Q3, it shouldn't have an overall impact on the second half of the year.\nC.J. Muse: Makes sense. I guess for mobility for \u201824. You gave some great detail earlier, but was hoping perhaps you could kind of rank order three nanometer complexity unit growth, potential for edge AI demand and any other kind of drivers we should be thinking about to support growth for that business next year.\nGreg Smith : It\u2019s specifically in mobile or \u2013\nC.J. Muse: Yes.\nGreg Smith : So in mobile, I would say that we bake edge AI into the complexity factor. So the edge AI is the market pole that is causing the chipset, the mobile processors developers to go to three nanometer and to increase their transistor counts a lot. So I lumped then and I think that's probably the key driver for complexity in mobile is increasing the capability for AI in the handset. Having said that, the pace at which complexity increases is kind of linear, it's not, it hasn't inflected up, it's not inflecting down, it's been a pretty consistent factor. The thing that we see inflecting in 2024 is the unit volume. So when we look at this, we tend to look at peak quarters, peak shipment quarters, and the peak shipment quarter in 2020 was 20%, higher than the peak shipment, quarter in 2022 for smartphones. And that's a pretty big hole to try and dig out of. So, next year, unit volume is going to inflect. And complexity has been increasing over the past, will have been over the past four years. So we expect to see unit volume being the driver\nOperator: Our next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan.\nSamik Chatterjee: Oh, hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess if I can start on somewhat related topic on AI, you mentioned the benefit, or the demand you're seeing on the memory side, but maybe if you can share your thoughts about 2024 looking at next year, where sort of the biggest impact on the business will be from AI demand perspective, memory and any other pieces that you see that demand coming through and I have a follow up. Thank you.\nGreg Smith : So cloud AI driving HBM and DDR5 is something that we expect to continue, it's still a minority of the DRAM shipments. And so there's significant room for it to grow. And there's also less oversupply in those parts than there is in the general DRAM market. The application of AI in mobile is going to drive the adoption of next generation flash protocols. And that will also drive performance of tester sales into that segment. And then when you look in the SOC space, there's significant business, of course, for traditional compute suppliers. But it is the primary driver for vertically integrated producers to be developing their chips. And so where we're looking for growth in those VIPs in 2024, for both especially for cloud AI, hyper scalar type stuff, but also in terms of AI capabilities and vehicles, we expect that that's going to be a driver of business from those nontraditional compute players.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay, and the follow up. Just going back to Vivek\u2019s question on robotics, profitability, I mean, we can see that, based on what you've done in that segment, looks like breakeven point is more sort of around $360 million to $400 million annually in terms of revenue. Any thoughts in terms of what level of scale you need to get to your internal sort of targets in relation to profitability in that segment? And as you think about the sort of next few quarters, what does the turnaround in revenue look like? How long -- how much longer before the distribution channel hiccups are out of the way? And then you're more dependent on the macro? Any views on that as well. Thank you.\nGreg Smith : Sure. So let me take that backwards. So in terms of how long does it take, we expect that we're going to see significant improvement in Q4 of this year, related both to the release of the UR20. And also, that will have given us kind of 12 months of direct account coverage in some large accounts, which is on par with what our normal sales cycle is. So we're hoping to see some improvement in Q4 results over where we are now. In terms of the scale for profitability, I think it's probably best to talk about that in terms of where we are now and where we're heading to. So our target going into 2023 was that this group was going to yield 5% to 15% profit. And we've capitulated against that because we're not achieving the growth. That is our baseline in terms of our planning for next year is to return to that range. And by the time we are at the end of this midterm in the \u201922 to \u201926 timeframe, we expect that profitability range to eke up a couple of points from there. But the answer to when the profits that we make from robotics is in the same range as our sort of mature semi test business. That really depends on the growth rate that we're seeing as we exit this midterm. So if we're on track, and that business is growing 20% to 30% per year, then we're going to continue to drive it in that 10% to 20% profit range, because we see a tremendous, a larger future value by doing that, if we're seeing that we've misunderstood the scale of this $500 billion potential end market, then we will be changing gears and trying to reduce our OpEx in those groups to try and get into the same range as the rest of the company. The rule of thumb that we are, that are we're planning to is we want that group to operate at a rule of 40. And I would be delighted to have it, delivering 30% growth and 10% profit exiting the midterm, because that means that we'd be on track for having that unit at multiple billions of dollars over the long term.\nOperator: Our next question is from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.\nToshiya Hari: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. Greg, question on the auto and industrial semiconductor test businesses. I guess the level set I was hoping you could share what roughly what percentage of SOC tests revenue in calendar \u201823 will likely come from auto and industrial? And I guess more importantly, how are you thinking about sustainability into \u201824? I think this has been one of the most extended upturns for your customers. And for you guys as well. I think collectively, we appreciate the long-term secular drivers and you spoke to some of them in your script. But how are you thinking about the cycle into \u201824?\nGreg Smith : Yes, so why don't I, I'll take the second half of your question. And I'll pass it off to Sanjay for the sort of exact splits in terms of this year. In terms of sustainability, the key thing that we're looking at is the increasing attach rate of semiconductors in cars. So there's the rate of EVs, as a percentage of the whole fleet is about a 20% CAGR. And I like that the portion of EVs is growing as a portion of the total car market, and there's twice as much semiconductors in EV as there is in a standard internal combustion car. When you roll all that together, what we're seeing is that the dollar value of semiconductors in each car shift is increasing at about a 12% rate. And that's a lot faster than the total semiconductor revenue CAGR. So there's this underlying driver in terms of an increasing attach rate. That's pretty, it's a fair amount larger than the variation in automotive demand. So the automotive demand is going to continue to cycle and there certainly could be periods of overbuying and periods of absorption coming in the future. But the fact that the utilization is as high as it is right now, and the end market fundamentals are this strong, we don't see that kind of softness. Coming into this year, we weren't as confident that it was going to sustain. Now, I do separate industrial out from automotive and industrial is it doesn't show the same kind of fundamental strength. There are some parts of the industrial market that are booming around clean energy, and in terms of the manufacturing infrastructure for EVs and batteries and stuff like that. That is certainly consuming semiconductors and it's helped driving significant growth of our business testing, high power discrete devices like GaN and Silicon Carbide. So we see strength in industrial it's not as pervasive as the strength we see in automotive. Does that answer that part of your question?\nToshiya Hari: That's super helpful. And then, Sanjay, any color on how, yes, thank you.\nSanjay Mehta: Sure. From, let me take it from a market and then bring it down to revenue for context. So we view in our view of the market size, we view that auto and industrial has about 25% of the SOC tam this year. And relative to our revenue, we believe that of the SOC revenue that we have, it's about 35% of our revenue, or just under roughly 20% of our revenue overall. That's how we see the year unfold.\nToshiya Hari: That's very helpful. Thank you. And then as my follow up, curious, Greg, how you're thinking about the memory test tam into \u201824? I think the markets been very consistent over the past several years, somewhere in the $900 million to $1 billion range, this year is I guess, no exception. But given what you're seeing in HBM, given what we hope to be a recovery in \u201824, across DRAM and NAND. Is there a possibility the market kind of breaks out? And it's closer to $1.5 billion? Is that realistic? And I guess, importantly how should we be thinking about your market share? I mean, you spoke about your presence in HBM being higher than your average in DRAM. But if you can kind of provide a little more context, that will be helpful. Thank you.\nGreg Smith : Yes. So it's, the memory market is famously volatile. And it is remarkable that the TAMS have been as stable as they've been over the past couple of years. I, it's too early in the year right now, for us to really peg dollar value or even a range for next year. I am optimistic that there is -- that there are more up forces than down forces against the memory tam next year. So you have sort of a consistent pace of technology adoption that we think is going to continue, we think that HBM is going to continue to grow as a portion of the memory business, we think that transitions to new protocols are going to happen. And from what I've seen in the analysis of the memory makers, it appears that they're working through their inventory, and that they may be in a position to start adding more capacity in terms of the mainstream of their business. So I think it's, I think it'll be up but I'm not going to -- I'm not going to agree with the number that you put out there.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brian Chin with Stifel.\nBrian Chin: Hi, there. Good morning. Thanks for letting us ask a question. Maybe I should just re clarify something. And this is sort of the math around industrial automation. I think to achieve the low end of your revised flat down 10% forecast, I might have to put input a pretty, very strong sequential growth in 4Q, even beyond kind of normal seasonal, is that correct? And if so, what are you factoring in? And does that include like rev rec on that backlog of your 20s that you have or something else?\nGreg Smith : Yes, so I think the way I would model it is normal seasonal Q4 plus the additional shipments of UR20. So we were expecting, our Q4 is always our strongest quarter of the year. And we have -- we've been taking orders for the UR20 for nearly a year at this point. And we have a significant backlog that will support sort of a new layer or basically represents additional SAM that we're serving that we were unable to serve before.\nBrian Chin: Got it. And that just sort of the release point is 4Q, why that sort of backlog up to the end of the year?\nGreg Smith : No. So we began shipments of the robot at the end of the second quarter, we will recognize that revenue plus continue shipments in the third quarter, but the volume per week is increasing as we go through Q4. So the bulk of the revenue is going to be in Q4.\nBrian Chin: Okay, got it. Thanks, Greg. And then just curious. Yes, on the other side of sort of the inventory correction, just curious how are you thinking about sort of native demand, a lot of talk about complexity here? Testing, understandably so, when you think about native demand for smartphones, on the other side, this unit correction, do you kind of even though it's been a big driver of the test, CAGR historically in relation to auto in relation to high performance compute maybe parts of the memory tam as well. Do you think SOC mobile, potentially is a bit of a drag on the test CAGR over the midterm.\nGreg Smith : So, it's interesting, we had a conversation about this yesterday. And we expect a pretty robust recovery in mobile over time. But at this, like while this has been going on, the amount of semiconductors in cars and the complexity of semiconductors in cars, is really accelerating. And the investments around cloud computing, and especially AI accelerated cloud computing are proceeding at a pretty good clip. So when you look back in time are sort of a large portion of the whole SOC tam was mobile and there were years for us where it was over 50% of our SOC sales went into that space. What we see looking forward is we think the whole market is going to grow at kind of 8% to 13% CAGR. That mobile will come back, but the rest of the market will have grown so that it's less concentrated in that area. So it's not like mobile's dead. But we think that there's a greater level of diversity across segments looking forward.\nOperator: Our next question is from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank.\nSidney Ho: Great, thanks. I just want to follow up with that Brian's question. If you look at Q4 guidance of being flat, quarter-over-quarter, you talk about the robotics business up quite a bit in Q4, but what gets you to flat revenue, in terms of what are the businesses are down taking any particular segment you would call out that may be below normal seasonality?\nSanjay Mehta: Well, hi, it's Sanjay here. Thanks for the question. I think it's just the timing within our semi test portfolio that you're seeing kind of the ebbs and flows. It's not uncommon for Q4, and some of our tests businesses to have a lower Q4. It's nothing more than that.\nSidney Ho: Okay, that's fair. If I maybe switch over to talk about the compute SOC, Tam, sounds like that is definitely stronger, you raise it, the overall Tam. But maybe within a computer, it's now $1.3 billion instead of $1 billion that you talked about quarter ago. Within that number, how should we think about the vertically integrated producers today? And how that can look like next year? And maybe what kind of market share are you expecting within the VIP group that you mentioned?\nGreg Smith : So one of the things that we have highlighted about VIP is because there are a relatively small number of players, and the parts that they're producing are quite complex, that it's going to be spotty that there will be capacity buys that happen for particular devices, and they will, and so one customer will pop and then a different customer will pop. So, we think that year-on-year from 2022 to 2023, the VIP tam is going to be down a bit. Our share like last year, we had more than $100 million of revenue in VIPs. This year, it's probably between $50 million and $100 million. So I don't know exactly what it'll be in 2024. But by the time we get out to 2026, we think that TAM is probably going to be somewhere north of $500 million so it's going to be a significant chunk of the overall SOC Tam by the time we exit this midterm.\nOperator: Our next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen.\nKrish Sankar: Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I have two have them. Greg, I'm just curious on the DDR5 and high bandwidth memory tests. Is it skewed more towards wafer tests or final tests? And what is your market share in either of those, and then I had a follow up.\nGreg Smith : So the fun thing about HBM is that it, it doesn't go into a package. So it's essentially all way for test, there are two phases of that wafer tests. So there's a test of the memory itself. And then there is an interface performance test, which is done at the wafer level. And so once all of that test takes place, and the HBM has been built up, then it gets shipped off to be incorporated into a chiplet base design for the final product. The tam that we're talking about for HBM test is probably roughly split about half and half between the core testing and the performance testing.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Very helpful. And then just to follow up on the VIP, you said it's going to be $50 million to $100 million this year, compared to almost over $100 million last year. Is that basically skewed towards one customer? Or one auto customer for you? Or is it more diversified?\nGreg Smith : No, it's much, much more diverse. So last year, like what you could probably think about is that the broad diversity of customers from last year to this year is actually increasing. But last year, on top of that broad base, a single customer did pop for a lot of capacity. So I think that's, so I guess the answer to your question is yes and no.\nOperator: Our next question is from Atif Malik with Citigroup.\nAtif Malik: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Greg, I have a question on your robotics business. You spoke about two challenges. Teradyne not able to build OEM channels fast enough. And then macro environment. And I'm just trying to understand how much of this is on you guys? And how much of it is on macro? Is it more like 60% on you guys for not building the channel? Also these higher weight robots and 40% macro, if you can help have a thought on that kind of split.\nGreg Smith : So it's a tough split to make. Because if you compare us to peers in industrial automation, we have a significantly different lead time profile than most industrial automation player. So we're working with kind of five weekly times. And for industrial robots and for standard automation, those lead times are out kind of two quarters. So we tend to compare what our business is doing to what their businesses are doing looking at order rates. And so if you look at order rates for say you are, we're down roughly 10%, year-on-year. So first half of \u201822 to the first half of \u201823. If you look at some of our robot, industrial robotics peers, they're down 20% or greater over that same comparison period. So there's definitely a broad economic headwind that we're facing. But because we're coming into this space as a disruptor, we would expect to have significantly higher growth than the main players. And right now, we're not happy with the growth that we're seeing. We also think that we should have greater immunity to these cycles, because we're solving a problem that these manufacturers have, whether it's good business or bad business. And so I think what you're seeing is our current distribution is quite vulnerable to macroeconomic cycles, and the distribution, the distribution setup that we're moving towards, is going to be more suited to deliver consistent results. So I would say that it's, honestly, I think it's mostly macroeconomic that the macroeconomic headwinds are particularly bad, given the types of customers that we serve and the way that we serve them. The build out of OEM and large account coverage is something that's going to give us better immunity in future headwinds.\nA - Andy Blanchard: Okay, and operator, we are out of time. So everyone, thank you for joining us today and those in the queue I will follow up shortly after this call. And we look forward to talking with you in the days and weeks ahead. Bye-bye,\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Sanjay Mehta",
            "content": "Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone. Today I'll cover the financial summary of Q2, provide our Q3 outlook and full year planning assumptions. I will also update you on our supply chain and resiliency progress. Now to Q2. Second quarter sales were $684 million, which was at the high end of our guide with non-GAAP EPS $0.79, which was above our high guide of $0.74. Non- GAAP gross margins were 58.8%. Above our guidance due to deferred resiliency costs until later in the year and improved product mix. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $251 million flat with the first quarter. Non-GAAP operating profit was 22%. We had one 10% customer in the quarter. The tax rate excluding discrete items for the quarter was 16.5% on a GAAP basis and 17.2% on a non-GAAP basis. Semi test revenue for the quarter was $475 million with SOC revenue contributing $355 million and memory $120 million. As Greg noted, we continue to see SOC strength concentrated in the auto end market. Memory sales were weighted towards technology driven buys as the industry ramps new, higher speed devices like protocol Flash for smartphones, DDR5 and HBM DRAM for server applications. System test group Q2 revenue was $94 million with $38 million in storage test, which has been down all year on continued low SLT and HDD production demand. In Wireless Test, revenue was $44 million in Q2 with ongoing low demand from both PC and smartphone end markets. Now to robotics. Revenue in Q2 was $72 million with UR contributing $58 million and MiR $14 million, which was below plan as Greg noted. FX did not have a material impact on our top or bottom line results. Shifting back to the company level financials, our free cash flow was $104 million in the quarter. We repurchased $135 million of shares in the quarter, paid $17 million in dividends and settled $2 million of debt. We have $33 million of convertible debt remaining. We ended the quarter with $813 million in cash and marketable securities. Now to our outlook for Q3. Q3 sales are expected to be between $650 million and $710 million, with non-GAAP EPS in a range of $0.61 to $0.81on 163 million diluted shares. The third quarter guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles, and restructuring and other charges. This outlook is above our April view at the company level. But under the covers test is incrementally stronger, and robotics softer. Third quarter gross margins are estimated at 56% to 57%. OpEx is expected to run at 35% to 38% of third quarter sales down slightly from Q2. Non- GAAP operating profit rate at the midpoint of our third quarter guidance is 20%. A little more color on our revenue and gross margin profile for the second half. Our revenue guidance excludes approximately $35 million of test demand tied to supply constraints in Q3, which we expect to resolve in Q4. As a result, we expect Q4 revenue to be similar to the Q3 level. If we clear some of the supply constraints earlier. Some Q4 revenue and resulting profits will shift into Q3. That will put second half revenue at roughly 51% of the full year. Shifting to gross margins. Our long-term model has gross margins at 59% to 60%. In 2021 and 2022, we were in our model range with margins of 59.6% and 59.2% respectively. In April, we noted that we expected full year 2023 gross margins to be at 57% to 58% due in part to transitory costs of adding new manufacturing sites for our test products. Geographically multi sourcing components and sub-assemblies to reduce supply line risks. We're also developing multi country capability of some of our design services work. In past calls, we know that expected margins to be lowest in Q1 and improved through the year. However, the timing of these resiliency costs shifted to later in the year, which was a driver of outperformance on gross margin in Q1 and Q2. Since that spending will now happen in the second half, our margins in Q3 and Q4 will drop to reflect these costs. Net-net, we continue to expect 57% to 58% gross margins for the full year. However, some of these transitory resiliency costs have been deferred until the second half of the year. Regarding OpEx for the full year, no change from our prior guide as we expect full year 2023 OpEx to be roughly flat compared with 2022. Now to profitability for robotics for the full year. As Greg mentioned, we expect lower robotic sales for the year. Even at these reduced revenue levels. Robotics gross margins are above the corporate average. And while we expect UR to be profitable, the robotics group overall is now expected to have an operating loss for the year. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are forecasted to be 16.5% and 17% respectively, in 2023. Summing up, our stronger test businesses in Q2 more than balanced weaker robotic shipments, leading to sales at the high end of guidance with gross margin improvements yielding profits above our high guidance. We're executing our plan to improve the resiliency of our supply chain and engineering services. We're modeling full year gross margins in the 57% to 58% range in line with our April outlook and are on track to hold our full year OpEx flat with last year. We have a strong balance sheet to support organic and inorganic growth, while we continue returning excess cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. With that I'll turn the call back over to Andy. Andy? Sure. Roughly at the midpoint, last time, we got to the SOC Tam, at the midpoint about 3.6. Now, obviously, it's Greg noted 3.7 to 4.1. So roughly a $300 million increase. And that's really tied to the compute market as a key driver. And there's we're rounding to hundreds of millions. So it's, but it's mainly in compute. And I would say, from a share perspective, our view on the full years that were roughly flat may tick a bit. Sure. Hi, it's Sanjay, thanks for the question. I'd say spread across the entire semi test portfolio across many of the product lines. And the supply shortages are, as I've noted, in the past, really tied to analog and linear logic, a couple of other items, but those are the ones that as we're working with our supply chain partners to supply comes online to enable that. And so right now, it's excluded from the range. And we're trying to be transparent, just as we have over the last couple of years. And I just want to be clear that if that does come out of Q4, and is provided into Q3, it shouldn't have an overall impact on the second half of the year. Sure. From, let me take it from a market and then bring it down to revenue for context. So we view in our view of the market size, we view that auto and industrial has about 25% of the SOC tam this year. And relative to our revenue, we believe that of the SOC revenue that we have, it's about 35% of our revenue, or just under roughly 20% of our revenue overall. That's how we see the year unfold. Well, hi, it's Sanjay here. Thanks for the question. I think it's just the timing within our semi test portfolio that you're seeing kind of the ebbs and flows. It's not uncommon for Q4, and some of our tests businesses to have a lower Q4. It's nothing more than that."

            "name": "Greg Smith",
            "content": "Thanks Andy, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll summarize our Q2 and first half results. Comment on the current business conditions and our view of the second half. Sanjay will provide the financial details on Q2, our outlook for Q3 and offer some financial guide posts for the rest of the year. Second quarter sales were at the top our guidance range as supply constraints eased. Earnings were above our guide on higher gross margins. At the halfway point of the year, overall company performance has unfolded as expected but at the segment level, tester was incrementally stronger in robotics weaker. In semiconductor tester, we are four quarters into a correction cycle driven by excess inventory, which has hit the mobility part of the market hardest. Automotive demand has remained strong and in memory test, the growth of DDR5 and HBM devices for data center applications are driving retooling. In our wireless and system tests businesses, demand remains muted unchanged from our April view. Robotics demand has softened over the past three months with worsening PMIs and the short-term impacts of the transformation of the UR distribution channel. Looking forward to the rest of 2023, we estimate the 2023 SOC test market will be $3.7 billion to $4.1 billion, down 13% to 21% from 2022. But up from our outlook in April. The continued weakness in mobility has been offset by sustained strength in the automotive segment. Also since April, the accelerating build out of AI enabled cloud computing is driving test demand for compute and networking. In memory test, we expect the market will be at the low end of a $900 million to $1 billion range we described in April. In this market, the impact of AI is evident, especially in the HBM DRAM segment, where we see incrementally stronger test demand for Magnum products through the second half of 2023. Although HBM represents a small portion of the overall memory market, it is in a rapid growth phase, moving from under 5% of the test market last year to 10% to 15% of the market in 2023. And our HBM share is higher than our overall memory share. This technology driven strength is offset by weaker capacity buys, especially in Flash for mobile applications. Despite the current downturn, we remain confident about the future of the semiconductor test market. Primary growth driver is an insatiable demand for increasing device complexity. This can be seen in cloud and edge AI applications like ADAS systems, spatial computing and privacy focused consumer applications. These require enormous compute power, tireless higher wireless data rates, and more sophisticated power management. We expect the automotive tam will grow at a faster rate than the rest of the SOC market through this midterm, driven by the growth of EVs and hybrids, broader adoption of features such as ADAS, cabin lighting and infotainment, and the high test intensity required to achieve automotive quality levels. The trend of vertically integrated producers or VIPs is a fundamental disruption to the computing segment and is beneficial to Teradyne. Companies that provide cloud computing, cloud AI and edge AI are seeking to differentiate their solutions by taking control of chip design. Efforts that began a few years ago are now beginning to proliferate in data centers and vehicles and this trend will accelerate. Over the midterm we expect the VIP portion of the compute segment will grow faster than the overall compute segment, and our share will be higher than in traditional compute customers. The semiconductor industry has a process technology roadmap that supports these new more complex devices. Three nanometer is ramping now, and two nanometer and gate all around are coming soon. In advanced packaging, we see broader adoption of stack dye for high bandwidth memory and chiplets for processors. These new technologies will drive longer test times and retooling to test new interface standards. Rolling that all up our growth hypothesis for the semiconductor test market remains unchanged. A similar complexity roadmap drives our wireless and system test businesses. In Wireless Test, new standards like Wi Fi 60, and 7 require new or upgraded test equipment. In system test, increased device complexity is broadening the adoption of SLT and a very solid pipeline and defense and aerospace puts our system test group on a solid foundation for growth. Shifting to the Robotics portfolio, I want to take a moment to highlight that Ujjawal Kumar joined Teradyne earlier this month, as the new President of our Robotics Group, which includes UR and MiR. Ujjawal joins us from Honeywell, where he ran the process solutions business. His industrial automation and software background combined with the deep experience in building businesses through organic and inorganic growth across multiple end markets is a great addition for Teradyne. And we are delighted to have him join our leadership team. In the second quarter, robotics demand softened significantly. The trends that we noted in April have continued and intensified, challenging economic conditions, particularly low PMIs in Europe and the US have resulted in lower demand in our highest revenue regions. We have previously noted the channel transformation work at UR was having an impact on pipeline conversion. This trend has continued in Q2. Large accounts development and the build out of the OEM channel are progressing well, but not quickly enough to cover for the market softness in the quarter. With lead times under five weeks change in end market demand especially with our current high exposure to small and medium sized businesses is felt quickly. However, there is no shortage in interest in our human scale automation products. We saw record lead generation from two major automation trade shows in the quarter, but there's a clear reluctance from customers to place orders in the short term. As the result, we are now projecting full year revenue for our robotics group to be flat to down 10% from last year. Despite the difficult macro environment and the short term impact of our distribution changes, we believe that we will emerge from 2023 in a stronger position in robotics. On the new product front. We began shipments in the quarter of our higher payload longer reach UR20. Customers serving welding and metal fabrication and palletizing across a number of industrial verticals have driven demand for the UR20 and a triple digit unit backlog. We will see our first UR20 revenue in Q3 and ramped shipments through the second half. We also introduced MiR insights, a cloud based tool to enable near customers to monitor and optimize large fleets across multiple workflows and sites more effectively. We are transforming the UR distribution channel in 2023. Recall, we are complementing our existing distribution channel with direct touch coverage at large customers and adding OEM partners that have high long-term growth potential. In the short term, it appears this shift is slowing sales from distributors that were dependent on a high level of UR sales support. Longer term however, the change puts our focus on customers with the highest revenue potential. Although, these changes will take several quarters to yield, we're confident that we're on the right path. We've added 28 new OEM partners so far this year, and are working with our distribution partners to directly engage with over 200 large customers. At MiR, our focus on large accounts is yielding good results. This year, our installed base at large customers has grown 3x the rate of our overall installed base. We view robotics as a long-term opportunity. The market drivers are clear, aging populations, rising wages, labor shortage and the reshoring of production to reduce costs and cycle time. We have innovative market leading products serving a market that has the potential to grow to 10s of billions of dollars per year. Our customers have already demonstrated the value of our product and ecosystem in their operations. And they're partnering with us to extend our robots performance to expand the range of tasks they're planning to automate. Teradyne brings the foundational expertise and engineering operations and customer support needed to enable UR and MiR to become premier providers of human scale automation. We are putting the structure in place to support $1 billion in profitable sales by the end of the midterm. This is a long term project. But we are seeing the early signs of this work yielding. Wrapping it all up, our test businesses are performing better than planned through the first six months. And we expect that performance to continue through the second half. Automotive and memory our strongest markets in test this year. And a combination of inventory reductions and new products should enable the mobility market to recover next year. Our robotics business was below plan in the first half. And while we expect the stronger second half of the group, we expect to be the below our growth and financial plan for the full year. Our plans to transform our distribution and expand our product line are on track. We are carefully managing our spending in this business while we execute these changes. With that, I'll turn things over to Sanjay for the financial details. Sanjay? So this is Greg. Yes, we think that storage is sort of running along at a minimal ship rate, we're going to expect to continue at that rate. And there might be a recovery in 2024. But I don't think it would be a first half thing. I think that there's still a fair amount of softness in the end market for HDD, a fair amount of oversupply. So it's really only when we're going to see significant capacity inflection when hammer comes online, and demand increases, that will drive higher test times and ultimately drive additional capacity purchases. But that's probably further out in time than the first half of next year. Good morning, Mehdi, this is Greg. So the semiconductor process roadmap seems to be pretty much in line with what we saw before, perhaps a little bit of ramping three nanometer a little bit more slowly than we would have expected maybe back in 2020. But in terms of compared to recent events, it's pretty much on track. The key thing is that those complexity transitions are occurring in a market where end unit volumes, especially in mobile are significantly down. So even though the complexity increases are happening, and we are seeing sort of the expected changes in test time, there is a fair amount of idle capacity because of the unit declines that's being filled versus at driving new tester purchases. So I hope that answered your questions. But basically, we think that the pace of new process adoption is kind of going as we expected. So I think our view of 2024 is that the number of high volume three nanometer devices is definitely going to increase, so there'll be more chips on three nanometers. And the sort of third party reports that we see around end market is that it's up but not up dramatically. So I've seen numbers between 3% and 5% in terms of smartphone unit volume increases. So we definitely think that there's going to be three nanometer coming from more fabs, they're going to be more parts on three nanometers. And volumes are going to be up. So we think that 2024 is going to be incrementally stronger than 2023. Good morning, Vivek. Thanks for the question. So the good news is that utilization hasn't gotten any worse. So tam it's up a bit so in the 2% to 5% increase in terms of utilization of Teradyne equipment. So our view is really of our own fleet, the thing that I will tell you is that there is a significant disparity in utilization between IDM and subcons. So, utilization inside of IDM is in the upper 80s. And that's well into the range where our customers are actively adding capacity. And that's really the strength that we see in automotive. In subcons, the utilization is nearly 20 points lower, but it is heading in the right direction. So I think it's a really good question in terms of how much that idle capacity will impact the size of business in 2024. So we are. that's sort of factored into our plans, we think 2024 would be stronger, but we really don't have a great idea about how much stronger it will be. So it's a good question. The first thing that I'll point out is that the group has consistently underperformed our profit targets, it hasn't consistently lost money. So this is, I think this is really the first year where we're projecting a loss for that group. But you're right, we are in robotics for growth, and we're not delivering the growth that we expect it to from this from this business. And what we're really discovering is that there's a, f I'm going to sort of sum it up, we misunderstood how large the potential end market is, and how much the early years of those business was driven by very sophisticated early adopters, people that were like, robot enthusiast. And what we found is that as we satisfied those early enthusiasts and started moving into a larger market, where people were more focused on just buying a solution, that they didn't have the skills that they needed to put these robots into operation. So that's the logic behind our transformation in the channel at UR that by shifting more emphasis towards solution providers like OEMs, we're going to be able to provide solutions that are at the level of the capability of our customers. And by directly connecting to larger customers. Those are customers that have the heft to be able to maintain and implement the robots within their organizations. So I think that the thing that's that we're discovering is that the challenge in robotics isn't as much around technology as it is a go-to-market and a product market fit challenge. And we have a lot of evidence that our products do deliver value, we just are working out the best way to get them into the hands of our customers in a way that they're going to be able to easily adopt them. Oh, yes. So thanks for the cue, Andy. So in terms of the competitive environment, the UR is a clear leader in its space, it has more than 3x the market share of our nearest competitor. And our shares in the mid-30s. We are, we see two kinds of competitors, industrial robot makers that are pivoting into Cobots. And sort of pure play cobot companies, mostly from China, we have not lost any significant share to the industrial robot players that have entered the cobot market in the past couple of years. But we have lost a few points of share to the Chinese pure play entrance. And almost all of that share losses specifically in China. So I said that our share was like mid-30s. worldwide, if you exclude China, our share worldwide is over 50% or around 50%. And it's much- much lower in China. And to be really frank, we are struggling with coming up with the best solution to gain share in China because a lot of that market is being served at prices that aren't profitable for us. And we're not really interested in growth at the expense of overall profitability. In AMRs, it's the Wild-Wild West, we have about the total AMR market is about $2 billion per year, and our share is probably in the range of about 3%. And we're in a crowd of a whole bunch of other companies that are in that 1% to 6% range. The thing there is that it's very fragmented, there's no clear leader and we are really working on trying to establish strategic relationships with global customers, because they're the ones that have the ability to adopt large fleets. So I think we see competition, but we believe that it's fragmented and will be able to outperform. It's specifically in mobile or \u2013 So in mobile, I would say that we bake edge AI into the complexity factor. So the edge AI is the market pole that is causing the chipset, the mobile processors developers to go to three nanometer and to increase their transistor counts a lot. So I lumped then and I think that's probably the key driver for complexity in mobile is increasing the capability for AI in the handset. Having said that, the pace at which complexity increases is kind of linear, it's not, it hasn't inflected up, it's not inflecting down, it's been a pretty consistent factor. The thing that we see inflecting in 2024 is the unit volume. So when we look at this, we tend to look at peak quarters, peak shipment quarters, and the peak shipment quarter in 2020 was 20%, higher than the peak shipment, quarter in 2022 for smartphones. And that's a pretty big hole to try and dig out of. So, next year, unit volume is going to inflect. And complexity has been increasing over the past, will have been over the past four years. So we expect to see unit volume being the driver So cloud AI driving HBM and DDR5 is something that we expect to continue, it's still a minority of the DRAM shipments. And so there's significant room for it to grow. And there's also less oversupply in those parts than there is in the general DRAM market. The application of AI in mobile is going to drive the adoption of next generation flash protocols. And that will also drive performance of tester sales into that segment. And then when you look in the SOC space, there's significant business, of course, for traditional compute suppliers. But it is the primary driver for vertically integrated producers to be developing their chips. And so where we're looking for growth in those VIPs in 2024, for both especially for cloud AI, hyper scalar type stuff, but also in terms of AI capabilities and vehicles, we expect that that's going to be a driver of business from those nontraditional compute players. Sure. So let me take that backwards. So in terms of how long does it take, we expect that we're going to see significant improvement in Q4 of this year, related both to the release of the UR20. And also, that will have given us kind of 12 months of direct account coverage in some large accounts, which is on par with what our normal sales cycle is. So we're hoping to see some improvement in Q4 results over where we are now. In terms of the scale for profitability, I think it's probably best to talk about that in terms of where we are now and where we're heading to. So our target going into 2023 was that this group was going to yield 5% to 15% profit. And we've capitulated against that because we're not achieving the growth. That is our baseline in terms of our planning for next year is to return to that range. And by the time we are at the end of this midterm in the '22 to '26 timeframe, we expect that profitability range to eke up a couple of points from there. But the answer to when the profits that we make from robotics is in the same range as our sort of mature semi test business. That really depends on the growth rate that we're seeing as we exit this midterm. So if we're on track, and that business is growing 20% to 30% per year, then we're going to continue to drive it in that 10% to 20% profit range, because we see a tremendous, a larger future value by doing that, if we're seeing that we've misunderstood the scale of this $500 billion potential end market, then we will be changing gears and trying to reduce our OpEx in those groups to try and get into the same range as the rest of the company. The rule of thumb that we are, that are we're planning to is we want that group to operate at a rule of 40. And I would be delighted to have it, delivering 30% growth and 10% profit exiting the midterm, because that means that we'd be on track for having that unit at multiple billions of dollars over the long term. Yes, so why don't I, I'll take the second half of your question. And I'll pass it off to Sanjay for the sort of exact splits in terms of this year. In terms of sustainability, the key thing that we're looking at is the increasing attach rate of semiconductors in cars. So there's the rate of EVs, as a percentage of the whole fleet is about a 20% CAGR. And I like that the portion of EVs is growing as a portion of the total car market, and there's twice as much semiconductors in EV as there is in a standard internal combustion car. When you roll all that together, what we're seeing is that the dollar value of semiconductors in each car shift is increasing at about a 12% rate. And that's a lot faster than the total semiconductor revenue CAGR. So there's this underlying driver in terms of an increasing attach rate. That's pretty, it's a fair amount larger than the variation in automotive demand. So the automotive demand is going to continue to cycle and there certainly could be periods of overbuying and periods of absorption coming in the future. But the fact that the utilization is as high as it is right now, and the end market fundamentals are this strong, we don't see that kind of softness. Coming into this year, we weren't as confident that it was going to sustain. Now, I do separate industrial out from automotive and industrial is it doesn't show the same kind of fundamental strength. There are some parts of the industrial market that are booming around clean energy, and in terms of the manufacturing infrastructure for EVs and batteries and stuff like that. That is certainly consuming semiconductors and it's helped driving significant growth of our business testing, high power discrete devices like GaN and Silicon Carbide. So we see strength in industrial it's not as pervasive as the strength we see in automotive. Does that answer that part of your question? Yes. So it's, the memory market is famously volatile. And it is remarkable that the TAMS have been as stable as they've been over the past couple of years. I, it's too early in the year right now, for us to really peg dollar value or even a range for next year. I am optimistic that there is -- that there are more up forces than down forces against the memory tam next year. So you have sort of a consistent pace of technology adoption that we think is going to continue, we think that HBM is going to continue to grow as a portion of the memory business, we think that transitions to new protocols are going to happen. And from what I've seen in the analysis of the memory makers, it appears that they're working through their inventory, and that they may be in a position to start adding more capacity in terms of the mainstream of their business. So I think it's, I think it'll be up but I'm not going to -- I'm not going to agree with the number that you put out there. Yes, so I think the way I would model it is normal seasonal Q4 plus the additional shipments of UR20. So we were expecting, our Q4 is always our strongest quarter of the year. And we have -- we've been taking orders for the UR20 for nearly a year at this point. And we have a significant backlog that will support sort of a new layer or basically represents additional SAM that we're serving that we were unable to serve before. No. So we began shipments of the robot at the end of the second quarter, we will recognize that revenue plus continue shipments in the third quarter, but the volume per week is increasing as we go through Q4. So the bulk of the revenue is going to be in Q4. So, it's interesting, we had a conversation about this yesterday. And we expect a pretty robust recovery in mobile over time. But at this, like while this has been going on, the amount of semiconductors in cars and the complexity of semiconductors in cars, is really accelerating. And the investments around cloud computing, and especially AI accelerated cloud computing are proceeding at a pretty good clip. So when you look back in time are sort of a large portion of the whole SOC tam was mobile and there were years for us where it was over 50% of our SOC sales went into that space. What we see looking forward is we think the whole market is going to grow at kind of 8% to 13% CAGR. That mobile will come back, but the rest of the market will have grown so that it's less concentrated in that area. So it's not like mobile's dead. But we think that there's a greater level of diversity across segments looking forward. So one of the things that we have highlighted about VIP is because there are a relatively small number of players, and the parts that they're producing are quite complex, that it's going to be spotty that there will be capacity buys that happen for particular devices, and they will, and so one customer will pop and then a different customer will pop. So, we think that year-on-year from 2022 to 2023, the VIP tam is going to be down a bit. Our share like last year, we had more than $100 million of revenue in VIPs. This year, it's probably between $50 million and $100 million. So I don't know exactly what it'll be in 2024. But by the time we get out to 2026, we think that TAM is probably going to be somewhere north of $500 million so it's going to be a significant chunk of the overall SOC Tam by the time we exit this midterm. So the fun thing about HBM is that it, it doesn't go into a package. So it's essentially all way for test, there are two phases of that wafer tests. So there's a test of the memory itself. And then there is an interface performance test, which is done at the wafer level. And so once all of that test takes place, and the HBM has been built up, then it gets shipped off to be incorporated into a chiplet base design for the final product. The tam that we're talking about for HBM test is probably roughly split about half and half between the core testing and the performance testing. No, it's much, much more diverse. So last year, like what you could probably think about is that the broad diversity of customers from last year to this year is actually increasing. But last year, on top of that broad base, a single customer did pop for a lot of capacity. So I think that's, so I guess the answer to your question is yes and no. So it's a tough split to make. Because if you compare us to peers in industrial automation, we have a significantly different lead time profile than most industrial automation player. So we're working with kind of five weekly times. And for industrial robots and for standard automation, those lead times are out kind of two quarters. So we tend to compare what our business is doing to what their businesses are doing looking at order rates. And so if you look at order rates for say you are, we're down roughly 10%, year-on-year. So first half of \u201822 to the first half of \u201823. If you look at some of our robot, industrial robotics peers, they're down 20% or greater over that same comparison period. So there's definitely a broad economic headwind that we're facing. But because we're coming into this space as a disruptor, we would expect to have significantly higher growth than the main players. And right now, we're not happy with the growth that we're seeing. We also think that we should have greater immunity to these cycles, because we're solving a problem that these manufacturers have, whether it's good business or bad business. And so I think what you're seeing is our current distribution is quite vulnerable to macroeconomic cycles, and the distribution, the distribution setup that we're moving towards, is going to be more suited to deliver consistent results. So I would say that it's, honestly, I think it's mostly macroeconomic that the macroeconomic headwinds are particularly bad, given the types of customers that we serve and the way that we serve them. The build out of OEM and large account coverage is something that's going to give us better immunity in future headwinds."

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Andy Blanchard, VP, Corporate Communications. Thank you, sir. You may begin.\nAndrew Blanchard: Thank you, Latonya. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our discussion of Teradyne's most recent financial results. I'm joined this morning by our CEO, Greg Smith; and our CFO, Sanjay Mehta. Following our opening remarks, we'll provide details of our performance for 2023 first quarter, along with our outlook for the second quarter. The press release containing our first quarter results was issued last evening. We're providing slides on the Investor page of the website that may be helpful to you in following the discussion. Replays of this call will be available via the same page after the call ends. The matters that we discuss today will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause Teradyne's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statement contained in the earnings release as well as our most recent SEC filings. Additionally, those forward-looking statements are made as of today, and we take no obligation to update them as a result of developments occurring after this call. During today's call, we'll make reference to non-GAAP financial measures. We've posted additional information concerning these non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure where applicable on the Investor page of our website. Looking ahead between now and our next earnings call, Teradyne expects to participate in technology or industrial-focused investor conferences hosted by JPMorgan, KeyBanc, Cowen, Stifel and Bank of America. Now let's get on with the rest of the agenda. First, Greg will comment on our results and the market conditions as we enter the second quarter. Sanjay will then offer more details on our quarterly results, along with our guidance for the second quarter. We'll then answer your questions, and this call is scheduled for one hour. Greg?\nGreg Smith: Thanks, Andy, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will summarize our Q1 results, comment on the current environment and outline how we see the market developing. Sanjay will then provide the financial details on Q1, our outlook for Q2 and some thoughts on full-year planning. From a financial perspective, we delivered first quarter sales above the midpoint of our guidance range, with earnings above the high guide on improved gross margins. In Q1, our flexible business model enabled us to convert improving component availability in semiconductor test into additional revenue and profit, and our robotics businesses delivered on plan for the quarter. Stepping back from the Q1 results, I would like to outline our view of the current market conditions and how we expect the next few quarters to unfold. In semiconductor test, lower end market demand and high channel inventory is persisting. And our measures of tester utilization in Q1 of 2023 are at their lowest level in over 10 years. The weakness is concentrated in Compute and Mobility SoC test and reflects further erosion in end market demand in 2023. After a 20% decline in PC shipments in 2022, they are forecast to decline an additional 4% this year. Smartphones dropped 10% in 2022 and are forecasted to drop another 4% in 2023. We have clearly seen utilization weaken as well. Intel inventory levels in these supply chains come into balance and the utilization levels improve, we expect test demand for these markets to remain at low levels. As a result, we don't expect any 10% customers in these end markets in 2023. Over the past four years, the Compute and Mobility segments have represented over 70% of the SoC market, so weakness in these segments has an outsized impact on the overall industry. There are however, several factors beyond inventory alone that make forecasting in this cycle challenging. These factors are likely to impact both the depth of the cycle and the shape of the cycle recovery. The first is the strength in the other roughly 30% of the SoC test market, automotive and industrial test. The demand that we're seeing here is stronger and more persistent than we expected in January. Tester utilization at IDM customers that drive this sector is substantially higher than at OSATs, which primarily serve the Compute and Mobility markets. In fact, high demand has pushed out our tester lead times for some configurations to be longer than our target. Wafer capacity expansion plans announced by many of our automotive and industrial customers bode well for sustained demand for us in these segments. Strength in these segments is being driven by a wide range of new and growing device applications such as EVs, autonomous driving and the digitization of industrial activity. We also see these customers working to replenish the inventory that has been depleted over the last three years. This strength suggests that the depth of the SoC test market decline of this cycle may not be as deep as past cycles. Another factor that makes this cycle very different is very strong tester demand from China-based chipmakers. The current test buy rate is substantially greater in 2022 and higher than the broader market and may not be sustainable at these levels. In the vertically integrated producer category, we have seen no slowdown in R&D or design-in activities. However, we expect low OSAT utilizations to significantly impact production capacity buys in 2023. When taken together, these three factors make it challenging to predict the timing and the strength of the recovery. Having said that, we do have better insight into the full-year than we had one quarter ago. We estimate the SoC market in 2023 will be between $3.3 billion and $3.8 billion, down about 20% to 30% from last year's roughly $4.7 billion. We expect our share of the SoC market will increase two or three points from last year's 36%. I will note that we have increased our 2022 market size estimate by $100 million since January. In the Memory segment, while oversupply is limiting capacity expansion investments the technology transitions we discussed in the past are continuing to drive test demand, especially for LPDDR5 and high-speed flash. For the full-year, we expect the market to be flat to down 10% from last year's approximately $1 billion level. This is unchanged from our view in January. We expect our share to be in the high 30s, also up a point or so from last year. We know that the global trends have driven over $300 billion of wafer front-end investment over the past four years, and that has not yet fully been converted into testament. When coupled with a forecast of an additional $160 billion of investment over the next few years, we think the fundamentals for midterm growth are strong. In our LitePoint Wireless Test segment, we see a more familiar correction cycle. We are also a year or so away from the next big complexity leap in connectivity, the transition to Wi-Fi 7. As a result, our early view has LitePoint sales down 20% to 25% from last year's level. In System Test, the storage portion of the business is impacted both by reduced demand for HDDs and declining smartphone shipments. As a result, our System Test group revenue will likely be down 20% to 25% for the year. Now turning to the Robotics businesses. Robotics revenue in Q1 2023 is down 14% compared to Q1 of 2022. The first quarter of 2022 was the last strong quarter before the invasion of Ukraine and slowing industrial growth began to significantly impact our results. As we've discussed in prior calls, there are both external and internal factors that are limiting the growth of our robotics business. And addressing these challenges remains a high priority for our Universal Robots and MiR teams. At Universal Robots, we see a mixed picture. The external market conditions remain weak. Overall sales softened and were lower in Q1 than in the same period last year. However, shipments to Europe have returned to their highest level since then. And in the United States, demand slowed substantially in Q1 after a very strong Q4. Demand in Asia also softened in the quarter. In most years, we see a weaker Q1 as strong Q4 shipments are digested. But it is clear that the manufacturing economy is also slowing as indicated by weakening manufacturing PMIs in Q1 for almost all repays. The primary internal factor that is impacting our growth is the ongoing realignment of our distribution system. Recall, we're shifting resources to put more focus on opportunities at large customers and OEM partners that have higher long-term growth potential. We are seeing some short-term headwinds from the shift in resources. An important positive for Universal Robots are strong preorders for our new high-payload UR20 cobot. We expect to have a backlog of over six months of volume shipments when we begin deliveries mid-year. The UR20 has already won numerous industry awards, including a recent Robots Business Review Innovation Award. At MiR, where we're coming off record Q4 shipments, we're seeing similar industry-level headwinds, along with seasonal slowdown in Q1 demand. However, our strategy to increase direct engagement with large accounts is latching with installed unit growth of over 40% in this sector from Q1 of 2022. With the persistent weak macro environment and with little evidence to suggest a near-term change in these conditions, we've brought our full-year revenue estimate for our Robotics group downward to be 0% to 10% growth from last year's $403 million. I would like to emphasize that despite the current market conditions, our view of the long-term growth potential for robotics remains unchanged. It is clear that there is a large and growing market for collaborative robotics, driven by labor shortages and escalating labor costs. Our strategy is to address this market with an expanding range of applications for our robots and a focused distribution strategy that we expect to yield an average 20% to 30% annual growth over the midterm. The fundamental drivers of all of our served markets, Test and Robotics make them as attractive as ever. We are focused on continuing to operate efficiently with strong financial discipline as demand begins to recover. With our flexible business model, we will maintain the careful investments in our products and capabilities that are the fuel for our future profits. I'll turn things over to Sanjay for the financial details. Sanjay?\nSanjay Mehta: Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover the financial summary of Q1, provide our Q2 outlook and the full-year planning assumptions. I will also provide some financial color around our robotics companies and update you on our supply chain and resiliency progress. Now to Q1. First quarter sales were $618 million, which was $28 million above our mid-guide with non-GAAP EPS of $0.55, which was above our high guide of $0.52. Non-GAAP gross margins were 57.7% above our guidance due to favorable product mix, operational efficiencies and some resiliency costs deferred until later in the year. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $251 million, about flat with fourth quarter OpEx. Non-GAAP operating profit rate was 17%. We had no 10% customer in the quarter. The tax rate, excluding discrete items for the quarter was 16.5% on a GAAP basis and 16.75% on a non-GAAP basis. Semi Test revenue for the quarter was $415 million, with SoC revenue contributing $347 million and memory of $68 million. As Greg noted, SoC strength was concentrated in auto and industrial end markets. In memory, our sales were strongest in flash final test followed by DRAM final test as the industry ramps new, higher-speed devices from smartphone and server applications. System Test Group Q1 revenue was $75 million with $34 million in storage test and low SLT and HDD demand. Recall, SLT has high exposure to the smartphone market and as widely noted, HDD markets are weak this year. In Wireless Test, revenue was $39 million in Q1 on the impact of both low PC and smartphone volumes and a low in complexity driven test investments ahead of the expected Wi-Fi 7 rollout beginning in 2024. Now to robotics. Revenue was $89 million with UR contributing $72 million and MiR $17 million. FX did not have a material impact on our top or bottom lines. Profitability was negative in the quarter on weaker revenue growth. We are trending toward a breakeven profit this year, below our intended 5% to 15% operating profit objectives. Gross margins continue to be above the corporate average. Greg has noted reasons for growth in 2023 below expectations, which is preventing us from achieving our profit goal this year. I would like to share some thoughts to enable an appreciation of where we are with each business. In UR, we have conviction in this very large market and believe it is still sub-5% penetrated coupled with our products and ecosystem leadership. One of our challenges is our distribution approach, which we believe has limited our longer-term growth. We are executing a solid plan to move to an omnichannel, which we believe will significantly enhance our growth potential. In the slower market we're seeing this year, our traditional channels are being impacted by an outsized rate before we see a full effect -- full benefit of our new channel strategy. From a profitability perspective, UR has operated above 10% to 15% -- sorry, UR has operated at or above 10% to 15% profit since 2017 with the exception of the initial COVID year in 2020. In 2023, we expect profitability of UR to be in that 10% to 15% range. In short, we are profitable while we continue to invest in transforming our channel, introducing new products, which increase our served markets and growing our industry-leading ecosystem. Turning to MiR. MiR's earlier in its life cycle and serves a more fragmented AMR market where there is no clear leader and the top players have less than 10% share of the market. MiR's in the Top 5 participants with mid-single-digit share. We're not yet profitable at MiR, we expect to be in 2025, which is aligned with our strategy to establish a leadership position in a market with long-term upside potential. This market is also less than 5% penetrated today. Given the strong pull from our large customers, we're making substantial R&D investments needed to realize the opportunity. An attractive feature of this market is the relatively concentrated customer base, which enables a focused distribution with heavy direct involvement in sales, service and product requirements. In summary, UR is profitable with a leading market position, and we're evolving our go-to-market approach. MiR is in the heavy engineering investment phase, creating solutions in cooperation with large customers, and we expect it will be profitable in 2025. Gross margins and robotics are above the corporate average and if we do not see significant growth opportunity in the market will reduce growth in OpEx and enable this portfolio to have greater than 20% operating profits similar to our test businesses. Shifting back to the financials. At a company level, our free cash flow was an outflow of $22 million in the quarter. We typically consume cash in the first quarter as we pay out our variable employee compensation. We repurchased $93 million of shares in the quarter, paid $17 million in dividends and settled $15 million of debt. Note, the share repurchase program began in late January, so it reflects approximately two months of purchases. We ended the quarter with $859 million in cash and securities. Now to our outlook for Q2. Q2 sales are expected to be between $625 million and $685 million, with non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.55 to $0.74 on 164 million diluted shares. The second quarter guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles. This outlook is slightly ahead of our January view as automotive and industrial semiconductor test demand continues to outpace our earlier forecast. Second quarter gross margins are estimated at 57% to 58%. OpEx is expected to run at 37% to 40% of second quarter sales roughly flat with Q1. Non-GAAP operating profit rate at the midpoint of our second quarter guidance is 19%. A few points to assist you in the modeling in the rest of the year given the unusual environment Greg has described. First, the expected revenue profile. We expect Q3 sales to be similar to Q2 and Q4 to improve a bit from there. As a result, you should expect the second half will be a bit better than the first. Now to gross margins. We've improved gross margins in the first half of the year, driven by accelerated operating efficiencies and deferral of manufacturing resiliency spending to the second half of the year. Full-year gross margins will likely be 57% to 58% range. Regarding OpEx for the full-year. As noted in January, we expect the full-year 2023 OpEx to be roughly flat compared with 2022. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are forecasted to be 17% in 2023. A quick update on our supply chain. While supply -- sorry, while supply and demand is coming back into balance for most of our supply chain, we continue to see shortages in some analog and logic devices. This is impacting about 25% of Tester revenue in Q2 and is outside of our guidance range. On the supply chain resiliency front, while some spend moves from first half to second half, strengthening of our supply chain is progressing largely according to plan. For our tester product manufacturing, that work will be substantially complete in Q3, though there will be component qualifications continuing for several quarters after Q3. The changes in our supply chain for our hardware services business will continue through the year. The costs related to strengthening our supply chain are included in the gross margin estimates. Summing up, we delivered sales above the midpoint of our guidance range with earnings above the high guide on improved gross margins. The auto and industrial Semi Test markets in '23 look incrementally stronger than we expected earlier this year with softer Mobility and Compute markets. Robotics demand is also incrementally softer. In this environment, we're making the investments to strengthen our global supply chain, while maintaining the R&D and go-to-market focus to support our long-term growth strategies in test and robotics. We're doing this while maintaining roughly flat OpEx since 2021. As a result, we expect to generate solid free cash flow in '23, which will deploy to maximize value for our shareholders through potential M&A, dividends and shareholder repurchases -- share repurchases. With that, I'll turn the call back to Andy. Andy?\nAndrew Blanchard: Thanks, Sanjay. And Latanya, we'd now like to take some questions. And as a reminder, please limit yourself to one question and a follow-up.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Please proceed.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes, thanks for taking my questions. Two follow-ups. I want to go to your LitePoint. Can you please help to understand opportunities in the Wi-Fi 6 area? It seems like that's already behind us? And when would you expect contribution from Wi-Fi 7 to materialize? Is that late this year or do we have to wait till next year? And I do have a follow-up.\nGreg Smith: Hi, Mehdi, so at LitePoint, there's sort of multiple phases of Wi-Fi 6. So Wi-Fi 6 is -- the tooling for that is largely in place. But there is a transition to Wi-Fi 6E, which is probably the primary driver of Wi-Fi investments in 2023. So there's a lot of R&D and development work going on, on Wi-Fi 7 chipsets and equipment that is probably going to ramp in 2024. So we're modeling that we'll have some Wi-Fi 6E investment through this year and then growing Wi-Fi 7 investment in '24. Does that help?\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes, absolutely. And then second question, the favorite topic how 3-nanometer capacity ramp in '24 could attribute? And the fact that you don't have toughened customer this year. Does that mean that next year is to be a big SoC ramp for Teradyne, especially given the delay in 3-nanometer that would finally have 3-nanometer high-volume manufacturing next year?\nGreg Smith: That's a great question. So first, in terms of like technology transition to 3-nanometer, we've seen no real substantial changes from any of our customers in terms of the pace at which they are trying to move to 3-nanometer to support more complex designs. So that drumbeat is continuing. The thing that we are seeing is that the declines in unit volume in PCs and smartphones has created a fair amount of idle capacity that needs to get filled up before tester demand is going to return. So the -- so we think that, that is likely to be significantly stronger in 2024. At this point in time, we don't know whether 2024 is going to be good or great. The other things that are going on is like I talked about the demand in China that might be sustainable, the automotive and industrial markets have been going really, really well, and we think they have great long-term potential, but there are often temporary supply/demand imbalances. So they might get incrementally softer. So there are some things that could mute the up that you see in 2024 that I think all of us expect with sort of a return in unit demand.\nMehdi Hosseini: Got it, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please proceed.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. So relative to your prior SoC TAM forecast you were down like 20% at the midpoint off of a 4.6 number. Now I know that you took that to 4.7 last year. But -- so you've taken basically a few hundred million dollars out of the TAM this year. So auto sounds like it's better. I know that you were thinking that auto would be down, it sounds like maybe it's flat at like $100 million [ph]. So can you kind of just sort of disaggregate that 3.5, 3.6 number at the midpoint that you now have for your new SoC TAM?\nSanjay Mehta: Sure. It's Sanjay. So disaggregating it, we think roughly the Compute market this year is -- and I'm going to give you the rounded numbers roughly at the midpoint, Compute at roughly billion dollars, Mobility at $900 million. Auto, we believe is flattish. And again, Auto and Microcontrollers at about $600 million, Industrial at $400 million and then Service at roughly $700 million.\nTimothy Arcuri: Got it. Got it, Sanjay. Thank you for that. So Greg, maybe we can ask about the -- there was a question on 3-nanometer. And this year, again, is going to be -- typically, you have a much more front-end loaded year than you are this year. It's sort of 50/50 seems like maybe it's -- so I guess, I'm just asking about is there something sort of structural going on? I know there's this debate the sort of cyclical debate versus the structural debate with your largest customer. And I continue to believe that it has to be up a lot next year. But is there something under the surface going on, there's maybe more tester reuse? Can you just sort of talk about what's going on under the surface that might kind of inform where the SoC TAM goes next year and where your share could go?\nGreg Smith: I can give you a little bit of color. So there's no significant change in the amount of reuse. The tester capacity that we've put in place is largely fungible across all of the technology nodes that are here now or coming. So we're really talking about what's the incremental demand, how much more capacity needs to be put in place. The one structural change is that we haven't really seen a peak in demand since leading producers of mobile phones have started to reuse silicon in lower parts of their product line. So instead of putting a new processor in all of the phones, they use last year's processor and a portion of the volume. So at this point, we haven't seen a significantly strong year since that decision has happened. We believe that long-term, that kind of thing will come out in the wash, but it may make the demand less peaky.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Please proceed.\nC.J. Muse: Yes, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I guess a follow-on question. Mobility at $900 million, worse level of spending in five years and 55% lower than peak. You talked about maybe not such a great year, next year, but curious what's kind of a base case kind of recovery assumption if you were to make the view that handset units would be at least flat. And given what you know content-wise and increased test times, what might that kind of impute for Mobility?\nGreg Smith: Yes. I think we don't have enough visibility into the way 2024 is going to shape up to really call a market size for next year? Directionally, I think it will be stronger, but I can't really tell you how much.\nC.J. Muse: Okay. And you talked about Q4 revenues accelerated to some degree. I'm curious if you can kind of speak to DDR5 kind of ramp when that starts and how that impacts before and the same thing for UR20. Is that a meaningful driver given your backlog? Or is that something that might get pushed into '24? Thanks so much.\nGreg Smith: Yes, so the DDR5 ramp we're kind of running against the same schedules that we've had for a while. So we haven't seen any significant pushout of the technology shift. So I think we've got a pretty steady demand for the capacity to support the new technology DRAM testers. For UR20, we're going to be starting substantial shipments of that in the second half of this year. And I would say that it will have a substantial impact on the growth that we're able to achieve in UR this year. It's going to have a meaningful single-digit impact on growth.\nC.J. Muse: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nSamik Chatterjee: Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess if I can just start with the auto piece here. I know you've called out the trend there, but if you can share your thoughts about how you think -- how sustainable that is, particularly as you're seeing, like how do you think of the correlation there to production volumes, particularly in the China market where we're seeing a lot of different players call out risk to production as well as demand in that market? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.\nGreg Smith: Sure. So how sustainable. There's a fairly large capacity increase that has come online in terms of ability to produce vehicles and the supply chain has reacted to that. We are starting to see that the lead times for many of the parts, the sort of electronics that go into cars are starting to come down but there are a lot of linear devices that still have extremely low inventory levels and extremely long lead times. And so that appears to be where capacity is being added to support reducing those lead times. So if they catch up, if vehicle sales drop remarkably or if they bring that more into balance, then I would expect that to soften. But the thing I'll remind you is that the current situation for us and our competitors in this space is we're running with tester lead times that are in excess of 26 weeks. So we have a pretty good idea of what these customers are going to need over the next few quarters. And so I would say that the likelihood that we're going to see a lot of softening in that space is probably out a little ways in time.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay. Got it. And for my follow-up, just on the memory side, there is obviously some I guess, news or sort of just speculation in terms of China looking at sanctions on Micron. Any thoughts of how that impacts dynamics with your -- in terms of your revenue mix and memory as well as with your customers in China in terms of their investment in memory? Thank you.\nGreg Smith: Yes. So I really don't think I can speculate on what's going to happen in terms of those regulations. I will say that we are a supplier to the two major memories producers in China. And if there are regulations that impact that, it will have an impact on our sales there. To sort of size that, our sales to indigenous memory in China, like all indigenous in China is about 4%, 5% of total Teradyne revenues and the portion that goes to memory there is probably between a half and two-thirds of that number.\nSamik Chatterjee: Okay. Got it. Thank you. Thanks for taking the question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.\nToshiya Hari: Hi, good morning. Thank you so much for taking the question. My first one is on component shortages. I just wanted to clarify. I think, Sanjay, you talked about shortage of analog and logic devices impacting semi test revenue in Q2 by 25%. So the interpretation there should be without the shortages, your Q2 revenue should be 25% higher. Am I understanding that correctly? And when do those headwinds have...\nSanjay Mehta: I noted on my prepared remarks, $25 million, which is outside of our range and it's roughly its SoC in memory.\nToshiya Hari: $25 million.\nSanjay Mehta: $25 million.\nToshiya Hari: Yes. Okay. Got it. And then my second question, just on your Robotics business. So again, you're taking down your full-year growth outlook for the year. Greg, you talked about the macro environment. You talked about the transition from distribution to direct and that having an impact. I'm curious if competition is having any impact here. It's always difficult to compare and contrast how you guys are doing relative to your competition, because most of your competitors they're either startups or small businesses within bigger conglomerates, but curious, particularly in China, is there anything going on the competition front? Thank you so much.\nGreg Smith: Yes. Toshiya, it's a great question. In terms of robotics growth, the first, just a quick correction. The change to distribution isn't like distribution-to-direct. It's really establishing an omnichannel strategy that we're continuing to invest in our traditional distributors. We're adding additional channels through OEMs and, in some cases, direct business. So it's not like a complete flip, but it does -- it is sort of moving resources around. In terms of market share, I agree with you. It's really hard to get market statistics about the COBOT market. The best data that we have is that from 2021 to 2022, share was relatively stable. We've got between 35% and 40% of a -- in 2023, it will probably be about a $1 billion market. Our nearest competitor has probably less than a third, a quarter to a third of that share and that number two player has shifted from year-to-year. The trend that you noted about China competitors is certainly true that the Chinese competitors are coming up, and they are doing very, very well in the Chinese market. The price points in that market are significantly lower than the rest of the world. And their understanding and knowledge of that market is better than our or other foreign competitors. So what's happening in China is that our products are tending to migrate towards sort of a premium tier, both international customers and customers that really value the ecosystem that we have. In either specialized software or specialized adapters that they can get with our products that they can't get with a local supplier. So we are -- we think we can hold the share that we have in China in that particular segment, but there's definitely a competitive threat -- pricing competitive threat from Chinese suppliers that we're really trying to deal with through differentiation.\nToshiya Hari: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please proceed.\nKrish Sankar: Yes, hi, thanks for taking my question. I had two of them. First one, let us Sanjay know auto industry is pretty strong maybe Mobility rebounds next year. I understand you don't want to give color into calendar '24, but would that change the gross margin profile because it seems like the auto industry has a much higher gross margin than Mobility? And then I have a follow-up.\nSanjay Mehta: Sure. Thanks for the question. This year, as I noted in my prepared remarks, we're going to be at 57% to 58%, and it's really tied to both product mix as well as we've got these, what I would call, transitory costs tied to manufacturing resilience. I think when that's materially behind us, I see no reason why we don't get back to our model gross margin of 59% to 60%.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Thanks Sanjay for that. And then you kind of gave some color on the SoC test breakdown with Compute being $1 billion. If I remember right, historically, the GPU test market has been around $100 million or so, give or take, and that has not been as test-intensive. So I'm kind of curious, as you get into all these AI stuff, do you think GPU test could grow. And what is your opportunity set there? Because historically, like Verigy, Advantest has been the leader over there. Thank you.\nGreg Smith: Yes. No, that's -- it's certainly a question we've been talking a lot about internally. So here's the way that we see it. The rise of generative AI, things like ChatGPT is a significant driver for additional cloud Compute capacity, especially accelerated capacity. Right now, the primary way that that acceleration is delivered is through traditional GPUs. So I would expect that, that's going to be a tailwind for our competitor who has much higher share with traditional Compute. At the same time, the same companies that are making these really aggressive moves to try and capture market share in the AI market are also the same vertically integrated producers that are developing their own ways to accelerate that type of Compute. And that's where we are investing our energy primarily is to capture those customers as they bring that kind of technology to market. I don't want to give you the impression that we're -- that like we have VIPs locked up, but it's a different situation than the traditional Compute suppliers, because these new players don't have a long history of working with any particular vendor. So we are in shootouts in most of these places, and we're winning more than our fair share. And so as this market evolves and AI becomes a more important part of the vertically integrated producers or hyperscalers, the overall value delivery. Our hope is that these internal devices will long-term have a higher growth than traditional Compute. So short-term, really strong for traditional. Longer-term, better for vertically integrated.\nKrish Sankar: Greg, thanks very much for the color. Is it fair to assume GPU is probably a $100 million of that $1 billion Compute market?\nGreg Smith: In 2023, I would -- my guess would be that it's bigger, but I don't know an exact number.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Thank you very much, Greg. Really appreciate the color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. I actually had a longer-term one. It seems like you're keeping your long-term sales and earnings model unchanged. But when I look at your largest end markets, mostly on the consumer side, they seem to have matured quite a bit. So what's underpinning the confidence about reaccelerating to that double-digit growth. And let's say if the new model is not for double-digit growth, what will you need to change about your cost structure to realize better profitability?\nGreg Smith: So Vivek, the things that we are looking at is we don't see a fundamental change, like you said in terms of a maturing of our consumer markets. We see the primary driver of the growth in semiconductor test to really be the pace at which leading chipmakers adopt new process technology. And there's a -- the thing that has happened is that the transition from 5-nanometer to 3-nanometer has taken longer than people expected. And I think that, that has contributed to some of the wall in the growth that we've seen in this market. But if you look, there is this -- there's a number of steadily increasing capability 3-nanometer nodes that are coming from both of the major foundries and behind that, there's a gate all around technology that's coming as well. And so as we talked about, the Compute and Mobility is 70% of the SoC test market. And the complexity in the Compute and the Mobility space is also the primary driver for advanced memory technologies and memory density improvements. So as long as that fundamental pace around nodes and node technology continues, then we think that the fundamentals for the growth are strong. I also noted that there is a significant amount of wafer front-end capacity that has gone in, but has not been turned on yet. And we think that that is a long-term driver for demand in the test space, because it's essentially the test equipment of dark fiber. It's there. It's going to get turned on and when it is, it's going to require testers.\nVivek Arya: Got it. And for my follow-up, Greg. Seems like your SoC business could be down in the second half, if I take that 39% share that you suggested of the lower TAM. So I just wanted to confirm that. And would Mobility also be down and if it is down, is it the 3-nanometer comment that you mentioned, is it not as big a node? So does that have implications on what we should be thinking about for calendar '24 growth in your SoC test business also?\nGreg Smith: Yes. I haven't really looked at second half, there.\nSanjay Mehta: Yes. So second half, I think you asked about SoC revenue in the second half. And as I noted in my prepared remarks, we expect revenue to be a bit higher in the second half. And part of that increment is really tied to SoC. And while it does have auto and industrial is the main driver. So we expect SoC in the second half to be stronger.\nGreg Smith: So and to the other part of your question, so -- actually, I'm sorry, could you repeat the second half of your question?\nVivek Arya: Of course. Yes. Yes. So what I specifically was trying to ask is, do you expect your Mobility demand in the second half to be better than the first half. And if it isn't, then isn't that a surprise given that your large customer will get on the 3-nanometer cycle. So is 3-nanometer just not as big a node and does that have implications on how we think about your Mobility demand for next year?\nGreg Smith: Okay. Yes. So it's a really good point and something that I think it's important to communicate clearly. We believe that the complexity increase enabled by 3-nanometer is on track to what we've modeled before. The reason that we are not seeing significant demand increase in 2023 is because the amount of capacity that is available driven by lower unit volumes is sufficient to absorb that complexity increase. So as unit volumes increase, we believe that we'll see the full effect of that higher complexity.\nVivek Arya: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Chin with Stifel. Please proceed.\nBrian Chin: Good morning. Thanks. If I just ask a few questions. Maybe to start with, I think yours an advanced SoC can outlook. So I think they rarely align these are things like service, et cetera, that might be in or out of your forecast. But they've seen especially far part this year with sort of the high end of your range, worst than the low end of theirs. I'm just wondering what do you think explains the kind of the discrepancy between each of your forecast this year?\nGreg Smith: Yes. So I -- Brian, it's a great question. Every year, this is sort of how the year starts that depending on the view from our perspective, the view from their perspective, you end up with a different view. And I think the challenging thing for us is predicting how strong or weak their business will be. And the same thing is true for them, is trying to predict how strong or weak our business will be. And so right now, you see that divergence. By the way, the same thing basically existed last year. And quarter-by-quarter, those numbers tend to converge. And you can take a look -- basically, I'd like to say that we feel pretty comfortable with the range that we set, the 3.3% to 3.8%. And we'll see if things strengthen through the year, we'll adjust that range quarter-by-quarter. But I don't -- I guess I don't see it as unusual as you do to see that kind of a spread.\nBrian Chin: Okay. Fair enough. So I guess your molds are better than theirs...\nGreg Smith: Actually, I don't want you to walk away thinking that. I think we ended up having a more accurate prediction last year than they did at the similar time, but if you look at it this year, I don't know that our molds are better than their molds for sure.\nBrian Chin: Okay. Yes. I love those kind of jokes. But the -- in terms of the omnichannel strategy also, Greg, for automation, when do you think that will be fairly -- you may have sort of alluded towards the end of your investor. But when do you think that will be kind of somewhat well rooted or established, and it will take probably more than a few quarters even potentially. But when do you think that will be pretty well established. And then even when you think about from like a scale or critical mass perspective, would that not make a lot of sense for you to market even maybe a broader portfolio of automation than you do currently once you sort of have that sort of revamped channel strategies established?\nGreg Smith: Yes. So that's -- it's like you're sitting in our strategy sessions. So the way to think about the omnichannel is that we are doing this in steps. The first significant new channel that we're -- that we've established for you are is the OEM channel. And that from '21 to '22 the OEM channel grew 16% year-on-year. From '22 to '23, we expect that same channel to deliver like 20% growth, even though, overall, the UR growth is going to be significantly lower. In this year, we're taking steps to try and establish more effective coverage of large accounts, and we expect that to start delivering towards the end of this year and to significantly impact growth in 2024. After that, we have other channel additions that we'll be making. So the idea is each one of these channels, we think, is capable of delivering kind of 20% to 30% growth. And as we add new ones, they're going to have a multiplicative effect. So we have each channel growing at that rate and then adding a new channel which adds a new growth source. So that's definitely the reason why we have some confidence about the 20% to 30% growth per year over the mid-term, even though we're starting at a much lower rate. Now the second question that you have in terms of a broader portfolio, yes, once we build this omnichannel, it is going to be a very powerful advantage for us in our Robotics business. And we will be looking to try to find ways to leverage that strength to find other growth engines.\nBrian Chin: Okay. That was a great color. Thanks Greg.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.\nJoseph Moore: Great. Thank you. I wanted to understand a little bit more the component constraints. And I guess if you could put that in the context of the last couple of quarters. I thought you guys weren't as constrained as advanced as was, and I wasn't really thinking it was holding you back from revenue. Now it seems like the component constraints are easing, but there's still some negative impact is core. So you can just put that in context what you've been seeing in the last few quarters? And how does that affect you from like a market share standpoint of advanced as supply versus your supply?\nSanjay Mehta: Yes. Great. So last quarter, we had a little bit of market -- or component constraint as well. We brought in roughly $10 million of that constraint into revenue into Q1. And I'd say that overall, supply and demand is kind of coming in more into balance, really with the fall off of demand. And fundamentally, we see things normalizing. I would say that there are a couple of suppliers with still very long lead time for some unique components that we source, and really that's driven by demand that has just started to spring up where obviously, we have supply chain programs. We have available slots. But when several customers in specific industries or end market segments are coming in that really ends up outstripping our availability to supply. So think about it as a couple of key component suppliers in a couple of the markets that we're seeing an uptick in that's higher than our expectation, which is great. I expect that this quarter will be $25 million -- as I noted, $25 million outside. Obviously, we're doing our best to service the customers. I see that hopefully going down into '24. But with this uptick, the good news is we have the opportunity to solve these problems, and we're working very hard to do it. We have a track record of execution. So just think of it as tied to a couple of key components.\nJoseph Moore: Okay. Great. And are those -- I know you had constraints like a year ago. Is it the same component? Or is that they're sort of just different areas like kind of moving hotspots of shortage that are moving around a little bit?\nSanjay Mehta: Yes. I'd say going back to '21 and kind of the first part of '22, I'd say there was a wide variety of component supply chain issues that occurred. And think about it, the band is narrowing considerably. While there's a couple that are still out there, that we're working through and working very closely with our suppliers that are showing continuous improvement.\nJoseph Moore: And that's very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Barger with KeyBanc. Please proceed.\nSteve Barger: Thanks. Good morning. Greg, thinking about your prepared comments. How do you reconcile the strength in semi test for industrial digitization with the softer forecast for robotics. It seems like those should be correlated to some degree? Or is there some other aspect of digitization that's driving the test volume?\nGreg Smith: Hi, Steve. So it's a pretty insightful question. So the thing that is going on. And if you look at us versus other industrial like robotics companies, you'll see that our results are significantly more volatile. And the biggest difference between us and them. And still, like if you think about cobots, they are $1 billion of about a $12 billion industrial robot market. The rest of the industrial robot market is running with one to two year lead times. And they are still very busy shipping product to help put together a whole bunch of EV factories and battery factories. That's a business that is not really core to the cobot space. And so I think that the -- one of the things that's going on is there's significant consumption of electronics into the other parts of the Robotics business, but our business tracks like PMIs and other broader indices a little bit more closely than that longer lead stuff.\nSteve Barger: That is a really great color. Thank you. And when you think about the longer-term story for your Robotics business. How is your thinking about the profit pools changed over the past year or two? Is it a pure volume game that's driving the focus on large accounts or do you see the value in the ecosystem that you can provide and the hardware is how you sell that or do you think that more value will be in the services and upgrades over time as the installed base grows? Like where is -- where do you think this goes to your benefit?\nGreg Smith: Yes, so it's -- the -- I don't really think of it in terms of a volume play, because that infers sort of commoditization, and we don't really see that happening. This is a high-tech space where technology differentiation actually matters. Having a better robot, having better software, easier-to-use capabilities, that makes a big difference as does having an ecosystem of partners that can help people build solutions quite quickly. The focus on large accounts, I think of that primarily in terms of our cost of sales, that by concentrating on a smaller number of larger accounts, we can sell more robots per account, and that allows us to grow with -- like that our sales growth will outpace our sales cost growth over time. So I see that as an efficiency game. The comment that you made about hardware versus services, I think that that's an important aspect of our future plans that we think that there are profit pools in retaining an engagement with customers that have bought our product, both in terms of providing service, but more importantly, in terms of providing new types of software, new components that will allow them to get more out of the product in the future. At the end of the day, our robots are really reliable. They don't break that much. So like a break-fix business, I would not expect to be a huge volume generator, but as robots get into more and more critical processes, these customers are going to want to pay for uptime and that's a more lucrative service model.\nSteve Barger: Would you get into more cobot as a service or robotics as a service over time based on that comment?\nGreg Smith: Well, we might want to get a beer to have that conversation. I think that like in a nutshell, we believe in service as a service, right that the models where people are trying to offer hardware that depreciates as a service is largely around who carries the depreciation, and I think it's an interesting model at the low levels of penetration that we have right now in robotics because customers are reluctant. They're worried about making investments that won't pay off. And robots as a service allow them to walk away more easily. We're far more focused on solving those problems so that customers are willing to make those investments, because they're smart enough to figure out if they get a better deal by carrying the depreciation versus paying rent for the robot. And that's basically what you're talking about.\nSteve Barger: Yes. Thank you. Appreciate the time.\nAndrew Blanchard: Hey operator, we're going to try to sneak in just one more question, please, if you would.\nOperator: Sure. The next question is Vedvati Shrotre with Jefferies. Please proceed.\nVedvati Shrotre: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess my first question is on the high bandwidth memory side. Do you think that kind of put a positive angle on the test intensity on the DRAM side. Is that an angle of just considering that these are advanced packages? Does that increase your test intensity or how should we think about it?\nGreg Smith: Yes. Hello everybody. So High-Bandwidth Memory is certainly one of the leading-edge technologies that is driving some tester sales, some technology-related tester sales, even though overall capacity is down. But it's actually a really small part of the overall memory business. So it's a positive, but I don't think it's nearly as significant as the transition to LPDDR5 or the next generation of flash in terms of driving technology sales.\nVedvati Shrotre: Okay. Got it. And sir, for my follow-up, on the auto industrial markets, I have kind of a two part question for this. So the market share has always been sort of 50-50 between Teradyne and Advantest. Are there any pockets where you would see your market share sort of be more dominant? And then as a follow-up to that, some of the front-end equipment players have been talking about China restrictions or getting clarifications on China restriction. Has that impacted you in any sense? Like do you expect some sort of clarifications and China restrictions drive your revenue sort of up better than what you expected?\nGreg Smith: Yes. So in terms of within auto industrial, any parts where we're more dominant, I'd say that the segment where we probably have a leadership position is in power and discrete test that when it comes to gallium nitride, silicon carbide, IGBTs, things like that. Our Eagle product line and the acquisition that we made of Lemsys a few years ago have allowed us to really establish a pretty good position in that space. It's not a huge part of that market, but it is a part of that market that we expect to grow over time. As for China restrictions, we don't know what's going to happen in the future. There is a lot of trailing edge fab capacity coming online in China and we're getting a share of that. There are also -- something that we are on the lookout for is that that is generally producing parts that you don't need a high performance tester to deal with. And there are some smaller test equipment makers locally there that are getting a share of that. So we're watching that, and we're trying to make sure that we protect ourselves against competitive losses.\nVedvati Shrotre: That's helpful. Thank you.\nAndrew Blanchard: Okay, folks. And we're out of time. So this concludes the call. Thank you all for your interest in Teradyne, and we look forward to working with you in the weeks ahead. Bye-bye.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Sanjay Mehta",
            "content": "Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover the financial summary of Q1, provide our Q2 outlook and the full-year planning assumptions. I will also provide some financial color around our robotics companies and update you on our supply chain and resiliency progress. Now to Q1. First quarter sales were $618 million, which was $28 million above our mid-guide with non-GAAP EPS of $0.55, which was above our high guide of $0.52. Non-GAAP gross margins were 57.7% above our guidance due to favorable product mix, operational efficiencies and some resiliency costs deferred until later in the year. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $251 million, about flat with fourth quarter OpEx. Non-GAAP operating profit rate was 17%. We had no 10% customer in the quarter. The tax rate, excluding discrete items for the quarter was 16.5% on a GAAP basis and 16.75% on a non-GAAP basis. Semi Test revenue for the quarter was $415 million, with SoC revenue contributing $347 million and memory of $68 million. As Greg noted, SoC strength was concentrated in auto and industrial end markets. In memory, our sales were strongest in flash final test followed by DRAM final test as the industry ramps new, higher-speed devices from smartphone and server applications. System Test Group Q1 revenue was $75 million with $34 million in storage test and low SLT and HDD demand. Recall, SLT has high exposure to the smartphone market and as widely noted, HDD markets are weak this year. In Wireless Test, revenue was $39 million in Q1 on the impact of both low PC and smartphone volumes and a low in complexity driven test investments ahead of the expected Wi-Fi 7 rollout beginning in 2024. Now to robotics. Revenue was $89 million with UR contributing $72 million and MiR $17 million. FX did not have a material impact on our top or bottom lines. Profitability was negative in the quarter on weaker revenue growth. We are trending toward a breakeven profit this year, below our intended 5% to 15% operating profit objectives. Gross margins continue to be above the corporate average. Greg has noted reasons for growth in 2023 below expectations, which is preventing us from achieving our profit goal this year. I would like to share some thoughts to enable an appreciation of where we are with each business. In UR, we have conviction in this very large market and believe it is still sub-5% penetrated coupled with our products and ecosystem leadership. One of our challenges is our distribution approach, which we believe has limited our longer-term growth. We are executing a solid plan to move to an omnichannel, which we believe will significantly enhance our growth potential. In the slower market we're seeing this year, our traditional channels are being impacted by an outsized rate before we see a full effect -- full benefit of our new channel strategy. From a profitability perspective, UR has operated above 10% to 15% -- sorry, UR has operated at or above 10% to 15% profit since 2017 with the exception of the initial COVID year in 2020. In 2023, we expect profitability of UR to be in that 10% to 15% range. In short, we are profitable while we continue to invest in transforming our channel, introducing new products, which increase our served markets and growing our industry-leading ecosystem. Turning to MiR. MiR's earlier in its life cycle and serves a more fragmented AMR market where there is no clear leader and the top players have less than 10% share of the market. MiR's in the Top 5 participants with mid-single-digit share. We're not yet profitable at MiR, we expect to be in 2025, which is aligned with our strategy to establish a leadership position in a market with long-term upside potential. This market is also less than 5% penetrated today. Given the strong pull from our large customers, we're making substantial R&D investments needed to realize the opportunity. An attractive feature of this market is the relatively concentrated customer base, which enables a focused distribution with heavy direct involvement in sales, service and product requirements. In summary, UR is profitable with a leading market position, and we're evolving our go-to-market approach. MiR is in the heavy engineering investment phase, creating solutions in cooperation with large customers, and we expect it will be profitable in 2025. Gross margins and robotics are above the corporate average and if we do not see significant growth opportunity in the market will reduce growth in OpEx and enable this portfolio to have greater than 20% operating profits similar to our test businesses. Shifting back to the financials. At a company level, our free cash flow was an outflow of $22 million in the quarter. We typically consume cash in the first quarter as we pay out our variable employee compensation. We repurchased $93 million of shares in the quarter, paid $17 million in dividends and settled $15 million of debt. Note, the share repurchase program began in late January, so it reflects approximately two months of purchases. We ended the quarter with $859 million in cash and securities. Now to our outlook for Q2. Q2 sales are expected to be between $625 million and $685 million, with non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.55 to $0.74 on 164 million diluted shares. The second quarter guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles. This outlook is slightly ahead of our January view as automotive and industrial semiconductor test demand continues to outpace our earlier forecast. Second quarter gross margins are estimated at 57% to 58%. OpEx is expected to run at 37% to 40% of second quarter sales roughly flat with Q1. Non-GAAP operating profit rate at the midpoint of our second quarter guidance is 19%. A few points to assist you in the modeling in the rest of the year given the unusual environment Greg has described. First, the expected revenue profile. We expect Q3 sales to be similar to Q2 and Q4 to improve a bit from there. As a result, you should expect the second half will be a bit better than the first. Now to gross margins. We've improved gross margins in the first half of the year, driven by accelerated operating efficiencies and deferral of manufacturing resiliency spending to the second half of the year. Full-year gross margins will likely be 57% to 58% range. Regarding OpEx for the full-year. As noted in January, we expect the full-year 2023 OpEx to be roughly flat compared with 2022. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are forecasted to be 17% in 2023. A quick update on our supply chain. While supply -- sorry, while supply and demand is coming back into balance for most of our supply chain, we continue to see shortages in some analog and logic devices. This is impacting about 25% of Tester revenue in Q2 and is outside of our guidance range. On the supply chain resiliency front, while some spend moves from first half to second half, strengthening of our supply chain is progressing largely according to plan. For our tester product manufacturing, that work will be substantially complete in Q3, though there will be component qualifications continuing for several quarters after Q3. The changes in our supply chain for our hardware services business will continue through the year. The costs related to strengthening our supply chain are included in the gross margin estimates. Summing up, we delivered sales above the midpoint of our guidance range with earnings above the high guide on improved gross margins. The auto and industrial Semi Test markets in '23 look incrementally stronger than we expected earlier this year with softer Mobility and Compute markets. Robotics demand is also incrementally softer. In this environment, we're making the investments to strengthen our global supply chain, while maintaining the R&D and go-to-market focus to support our long-term growth strategies in test and robotics. We're doing this while maintaining roughly flat OpEx since 2021. As a result, we expect to generate solid free cash flow in '23, which will deploy to maximize value for our shareholders through potential M&A, dividends and shareholder repurchases -- share repurchases. With that, I'll turn the call back to Andy. Andy? Sure. It's Sanjay. So disaggregating it, we think roughly the Compute market this year is -- and I'm going to give you the rounded numbers roughly at the midpoint, Compute at roughly billion dollars, Mobility at $900 million. Auto, we believe is flattish. And again, Auto and Microcontrollers at about $600 million, Industrial at $400 million and then Service at roughly $700 million. I noted on my prepared remarks, $25 million, which is outside of our range and it's roughly its SoC in memory. $25 million. Sure. Thanks for the question. This year, as I noted in my prepared remarks, we're going to be at 57% to 58%, and it's really tied to both product mix as well as we've got these, what I would call, transitory costs tied to manufacturing resilience. I think when that's materially behind us, I see no reason why we don't get back to our model gross margin of 59% to 60%. Yes. So second half, I think you asked about SoC revenue in the second half. And as I noted in my prepared remarks, we expect revenue to be a bit higher in the second half. And part of that increment is really tied to SoC. And while it does have auto and industrial is the main driver. So we expect SoC in the second half to be stronger. Yes. Great. So last quarter, we had a little bit of market -- or component constraint as well. We brought in roughly $10 million of that constraint into revenue into Q1. And I'd say that overall, supply and demand is kind of coming in more into balance, really with the fall off of demand. And fundamentally, we see things normalizing. I would say that there are a couple of suppliers with still very long lead time for some unique components that we source, and really that's driven by demand that has just started to spring up where obviously, we have supply chain programs. We have available slots. But when several customers in specific industries or end market segments are coming in that really ends up outstripping our availability to supply. So think about it as a couple of key component suppliers in a couple of the markets that we're seeing an uptick in that's higher than our expectation, which is great. I expect that this quarter will be $25 million -- as I noted, $25 million outside. Obviously, we're doing our best to service the customers. I see that hopefully going down into '24. But with this uptick, the good news is we have the opportunity to solve these problems, and we're working very hard to do it. We have a track record of execution. So just think of it as tied to a couple of key components. Yes. I'd say going back to '21 and kind of the first part of '22, I'd say there was a wide variety of component supply chain issues that occurred. And think about it, the band is narrowing considerably. While there's a couple that are still out there, that we're working through and working very closely with our suppliers that are showing continuous improvement."

            "name": "Greg Smith",
            "content": "Thanks, Andy, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will summarize our Q1 results, comment on the current environment and outline how we see the market developing. Sanjay will then provide the financial details on Q1, our outlook for Q2 and some thoughts on full-year planning. From a financial perspective, we delivered first quarter sales above the midpoint of our guidance range, with earnings above the high guide on improved gross margins. In Q1, our flexible business model enabled us to convert improving component availability in semiconductor test into additional revenue and profit, and our robotics businesses delivered on plan for the quarter. Stepping back from the Q1 results, I would like to outline our view of the current market conditions and how we expect the next few quarters to unfold. In semiconductor test, lower end market demand and high channel inventory is persisting. And our measures of tester utilization in Q1 of 2023 are at their lowest level in over 10 years. The weakness is concentrated in Compute and Mobility SoC test and reflects further erosion in end market demand in 2023. After a 20% decline in PC shipments in 2022, they are forecast to decline an additional 4% this year. Smartphones dropped 10% in 2022 and are forecasted to drop another 4% in 2023. We have clearly seen utilization weaken as well. Intel inventory levels in these supply chains come into balance and the utilization levels improve, we expect test demand for these markets to remain at low levels. As a result, we don't expect any 10% customers in these end markets in 2023. Over the past four years, the Compute and Mobility segments have represented over 70% of the SoC market, so weakness in these segments has an outsized impact on the overall industry. There are however, several factors beyond inventory alone that make forecasting in this cycle challenging. These factors are likely to impact both the depth of the cycle and the shape of the cycle recovery. The first is the strength in the other roughly 30% of the SoC test market, automotive and industrial test. The demand that we're seeing here is stronger and more persistent than we expected in January. Tester utilization at IDM customers that drive this sector is substantially higher than at OSATs, which primarily serve the Compute and Mobility markets. In fact, high demand has pushed out our tester lead times for some configurations to be longer than our target. Wafer capacity expansion plans announced by many of our automotive and industrial customers bode well for sustained demand for us in these segments. Strength in these segments is being driven by a wide range of new and growing device applications such as EVs, autonomous driving and the digitization of industrial activity. We also see these customers working to replenish the inventory that has been depleted over the last three years. This strength suggests that the depth of the SoC test market decline of this cycle may not be as deep as past cycles. Another factor that makes this cycle very different is very strong tester demand from China-based chipmakers. The current test buy rate is substantially greater in 2022 and higher than the broader market and may not be sustainable at these levels. In the vertically integrated producer category, we have seen no slowdown in R&D or design-in activities. However, we expect low OSAT utilizations to significantly impact production capacity buys in 2023. When taken together, these three factors make it challenging to predict the timing and the strength of the recovery. Having said that, we do have better insight into the full-year than we had one quarter ago. We estimate the SoC market in 2023 will be between $3.3 billion and $3.8 billion, down about 20% to 30% from last year's roughly $4.7 billion. We expect our share of the SoC market will increase two or three points from last year's 36%. I will note that we have increased our 2022 market size estimate by $100 million since January. In the Memory segment, while oversupply is limiting capacity expansion investments the technology transitions we discussed in the past are continuing to drive test demand, especially for LPDDR5 and high-speed flash. For the full-year, we expect the market to be flat to down 10% from last year's approximately $1 billion level. This is unchanged from our view in January. We expect our share to be in the high 30s, also up a point or so from last year. We know that the global trends have driven over $300 billion of wafer front-end investment over the past four years, and that has not yet fully been converted into testament. When coupled with a forecast of an additional $160 billion of investment over the next few years, we think the fundamentals for midterm growth are strong. In our LitePoint Wireless Test segment, we see a more familiar correction cycle. We are also a year or so away from the next big complexity leap in connectivity, the transition to Wi-Fi 7. As a result, our early view has LitePoint sales down 20% to 25% from last year's level. In System Test, the storage portion of the business is impacted both by reduced demand for HDDs and declining smartphone shipments. As a result, our System Test group revenue will likely be down 20% to 25% for the year. Now turning to the Robotics businesses. Robotics revenue in Q1 2023 is down 14% compared to Q1 of 2022. The first quarter of 2022 was the last strong quarter before the invasion of Ukraine and slowing industrial growth began to significantly impact our results. As we've discussed in prior calls, there are both external and internal factors that are limiting the growth of our robotics business. And addressing these challenges remains a high priority for our Universal Robots and MiR teams. At Universal Robots, we see a mixed picture. The external market conditions remain weak. Overall sales softened and were lower in Q1 than in the same period last year. However, shipments to Europe have returned to their highest level since then. And in the United States, demand slowed substantially in Q1 after a very strong Q4. Demand in Asia also softened in the quarter. In most years, we see a weaker Q1 as strong Q4 shipments are digested. But it is clear that the manufacturing economy is also slowing as indicated by weakening manufacturing PMIs in Q1 for almost all repays. The primary internal factor that is impacting our growth is the ongoing realignment of our distribution system. Recall, we're shifting resources to put more focus on opportunities at large customers and OEM partners that have higher long-term growth potential. We are seeing some short-term headwinds from the shift in resources. An important positive for Universal Robots are strong preorders for our new high-payload UR20 cobot. We expect to have a backlog of over six months of volume shipments when we begin deliveries mid-year. The UR20 has already won numerous industry awards, including a recent Robots Business Review Innovation Award. At MiR, where we're coming off record Q4 shipments, we're seeing similar industry-level headwinds, along with seasonal slowdown in Q1 demand. However, our strategy to increase direct engagement with large accounts is latching with installed unit growth of over 40% in this sector from Q1 of 2022. With the persistent weak macro environment and with little evidence to suggest a near-term change in these conditions, we've brought our full-year revenue estimate for our Robotics group downward to be 0% to 10% growth from last year's $403 million. I would like to emphasize that despite the current market conditions, our view of the long-term growth potential for robotics remains unchanged. It is clear that there is a large and growing market for collaborative robotics, driven by labor shortages and escalating labor costs. Our strategy is to address this market with an expanding range of applications for our robots and a focused distribution strategy that we expect to yield an average 20% to 30% annual growth over the midterm. The fundamental drivers of all of our served markets, Test and Robotics make them as attractive as ever. We are focused on continuing to operate efficiently with strong financial discipline as demand begins to recover. With our flexible business model, we will maintain the careful investments in our products and capabilities that are the fuel for our future profits. I'll turn things over to Sanjay for the financial details. Sanjay? Hi, Mehdi, so at LitePoint, there's sort of multiple phases of Wi-Fi 6. So Wi-Fi 6 is -- the tooling for that is largely in place. But there is a transition to Wi-Fi 6E, which is probably the primary driver of Wi-Fi investments in 2023. So there's a lot of R&D and development work going on, on Wi-Fi 7 chipsets and equipment that is probably going to ramp in 2024. So we're modeling that we'll have some Wi-Fi 6E investment through this year and then growing Wi-Fi 7 investment in '24. Does that help? That's a great question. So first, in terms of like technology transition to 3-nanometer, we've seen no real substantial changes from any of our customers in terms of the pace at which they are trying to move to 3-nanometer to support more complex designs. So that drumbeat is continuing. The thing that we are seeing is that the declines in unit volume in PCs and smartphones has created a fair amount of idle capacity that needs to get filled up before tester demand is going to return. So the -- so we think that, that is likely to be significantly stronger in 2024. At this point in time, we don't know whether 2024 is going to be good or great. The other things that are going on is like I talked about the demand in China that might be sustainable, the automotive and industrial markets have been going really, really well, and we think they have great long-term potential, but there are often temporary supply/demand imbalances. So they might get incrementally softer. So there are some things that could mute the up that you see in 2024 that I think all of us expect with sort of a return in unit demand. I can give you a little bit of color. So there's no significant change in the amount of reuse. The tester capacity that we've put in place is largely fungible across all of the technology nodes that are here now or coming. So we're really talking about what's the incremental demand, how much more capacity needs to be put in place. The one structural change is that we haven't really seen a peak in demand since leading producers of mobile phones have started to reuse silicon in lower parts of their product line. So instead of putting a new processor in all of the phones, they use last year's processor and a portion of the volume. So at this point, we haven't seen a significantly strong year since that decision has happened. We believe that long-term, that kind of thing will come out in the wash, but it may make the demand less peaky. Yes. I think we don't have enough visibility into the way 2024 is going to shape up to really call a market size for next year? Directionally, I think it will be stronger, but I can't really tell you how much. Yes, so the DDR5 ramp we're kind of running against the same schedules that we've had for a while. So we haven't seen any significant pushout of the technology shift. So I think we've got a pretty steady demand for the capacity to support the new technology DRAM testers. For UR20, we're going to be starting substantial shipments of that in the second half of this year. And I would say that it will have a substantial impact on the growth that we're able to achieve in UR this year. It's going to have a meaningful single-digit impact on growth. Sure. So how sustainable. There's a fairly large capacity increase that has come online in terms of ability to produce vehicles and the supply chain has reacted to that. We are starting to see that the lead times for many of the parts, the sort of electronics that go into cars are starting to come down but there are a lot of linear devices that still have extremely low inventory levels and extremely long lead times. And so that appears to be where capacity is being added to support reducing those lead times. So if they catch up, if vehicle sales drop remarkably or if they bring that more into balance, then I would expect that to soften. But the thing I'll remind you is that the current situation for us and our competitors in this space is we're running with tester lead times that are in excess of 26 weeks. So we have a pretty good idea of what these customers are going to need over the next few quarters. And so I would say that the likelihood that we're going to see a lot of softening in that space is probably out a little ways in time. Yes. So I really don't think I can speculate on what's going to happen in terms of those regulations. I will say that we are a supplier to the two major memories producers in China. And if there are regulations that impact that, it will have an impact on our sales there. To sort of size that, our sales to indigenous memory in China, like all indigenous in China is about 4%, 5% of total Teradyne revenues and the portion that goes to memory there is probably between a half and two-thirds of that number. Yes. Toshiya, it's a great question. In terms of robotics growth, the first, just a quick correction. The change to distribution isn't like distribution-to-direct. It's really establishing an omnichannel strategy that we're continuing to invest in our traditional distributors. We're adding additional channels through OEMs and, in some cases, direct business. So it's not like a complete flip, but it does -- it is sort of moving resources around. In terms of market share, I agree with you. It's really hard to get market statistics about the COBOT market. The best data that we have is that from 2021 to 2022, share was relatively stable. We've got between 35% and 40% of a -- in 2023, it will probably be about a $1 billion market. Our nearest competitor has probably less than a third, a quarter to a third of that share and that number two player has shifted from year-to-year. The trend that you noted about China competitors is certainly true that the Chinese competitors are coming up, and they are doing very, very well in the Chinese market. The price points in that market are significantly lower than the rest of the world. And their understanding and knowledge of that market is better than our or other foreign competitors. So what's happening in China is that our products are tending to migrate towards sort of a premium tier, both international customers and customers that really value the ecosystem that we have. In either specialized software or specialized adapters that they can get with our products that they can't get with a local supplier. So we are -- we think we can hold the share that we have in China in that particular segment, but there's definitely a competitive threat -- pricing competitive threat from Chinese suppliers that we're really trying to deal with through differentiation. Yes. No, that's -- it's certainly a question we've been talking a lot about internally. So here's the way that we see it. The rise of generative AI, things like ChatGPT is a significant driver for additional cloud Compute capacity, especially accelerated capacity. Right now, the primary way that that acceleration is delivered is through traditional GPUs. So I would expect that, that's going to be a tailwind for our competitor who has much higher share with traditional Compute. At the same time, the same companies that are making these really aggressive moves to try and capture market share in the AI market are also the same vertically integrated producers that are developing their own ways to accelerate that type of Compute. And that's where we are investing our energy primarily is to capture those customers as they bring that kind of technology to market. I don't want to give you the impression that we're -- that like we have VIPs locked up, but it's a different situation than the traditional Compute suppliers, because these new players don't have a long history of working with any particular vendor. So we are in shootouts in most of these places, and we're winning more than our fair share. And so as this market evolves and AI becomes a more important part of the vertically integrated producers or hyperscalers, the overall value delivery. Our hope is that these internal devices will long-term have a higher growth than traditional Compute. So short-term, really strong for traditional. Longer-term, better for vertically integrated. In 2023, I would -- my guess would be that it's bigger, but I don't know an exact number. So Vivek, the things that we are looking at is we don't see a fundamental change, like you said in terms of a maturing of our consumer markets. We see the primary driver of the growth in semiconductor test to really be the pace at which leading chipmakers adopt new process technology. And there's a -- the thing that has happened is that the transition from 5-nanometer to 3-nanometer has taken longer than people expected. And I think that, that has contributed to some of the wall in the growth that we've seen in this market. But if you look, there is this -- there's a number of steadily increasing capability 3-nanometer nodes that are coming from both of the major foundries and behind that, there's a gate all around technology that's coming as well. And so as we talked about, the Compute and Mobility is 70% of the SoC test market. And the complexity in the Compute and the Mobility space is also the primary driver for advanced memory technologies and memory density improvements. So as long as that fundamental pace around nodes and node technology continues, then we think that the fundamentals for the growth are strong. I also noted that there is a significant amount of wafer front-end capacity that has gone in, but has not been turned on yet. And we think that that is a long-term driver for demand in the test space, because it's essentially the test equipment of dark fiber. It's there. It's going to get turned on and when it is, it's going to require testers. Yes. I haven't really looked at second half, there. So and to the other part of your question, so -- actually, I'm sorry, could you repeat the second half of your question? Okay. Yes. So it's a really good point and something that I think it's important to communicate clearly. We believe that the complexity increase enabled by 3-nanometer is on track to what we've modeled before. The reason that we are not seeing significant demand increase in 2023 is because the amount of capacity that is available driven by lower unit volumes is sufficient to absorb that complexity increase. So as unit volumes increase, we believe that we'll see the full effect of that higher complexity. Yes. So I -- Brian, it's a great question. Every year, this is sort of how the year starts that depending on the view from our perspective, the view from their perspective, you end up with a different view. And I think the challenging thing for us is predicting how strong or weak their business will be. And the same thing is true for them, is trying to predict how strong or weak our business will be. And so right now, you see that divergence. By the way, the same thing basically existed last year. And quarter-by-quarter, those numbers tend to converge. And you can take a look -- basically, I'd like to say that we feel pretty comfortable with the range that we set, the 3.3% to 3.8%. And we'll see if things strengthen through the year, we'll adjust that range quarter-by-quarter. But I don't -- I guess I don't see it as unusual as you do to see that kind of a spread. Actually, I don't want you to walk away thinking that. I think we ended up having a more accurate prediction last year than they did at the similar time, but if you look at it this year, I don't know that our molds are better than their molds for sure. Yes. So that's -- it's like you're sitting in our strategy sessions. So the way to think about the omnichannel is that we are doing this in steps. The first significant new channel that we're -- that we've established for you are is the OEM channel. And that from '21 to '22 the OEM channel grew 16% year-on-year. From '22 to '23, we expect that same channel to deliver like 20% growth, even though, overall, the UR growth is going to be significantly lower. In this year, we're taking steps to try and establish more effective coverage of large accounts, and we expect that to start delivering towards the end of this year and to significantly impact growth in 2024. After that, we have other channel additions that we'll be making. So the idea is each one of these channels, we think, is capable of delivering kind of 20% to 30% growth. And as we add new ones, they're going to have a multiplicative effect. So we have each channel growing at that rate and then adding a new channel which adds a new growth source. So that's definitely the reason why we have some confidence about the 20% to 30% growth per year over the mid-term, even though we're starting at a much lower rate. Now the second question that you have in terms of a broader portfolio, yes, once we build this omnichannel, it is going to be a very powerful advantage for us in our Robotics business. And we will be looking to try to find ways to leverage that strength to find other growth engines. Hi, Steve. So it's a pretty insightful question. So the thing that is going on. And if you look at us versus other industrial like robotics companies, you'll see that our results are significantly more volatile. And the biggest difference between us and them. And still, like if you think about cobots, they are $1 billion of about a $12 billion industrial robot market. The rest of the industrial robot market is running with one to two year lead times. And they are still very busy shipping product to help put together a whole bunch of EV factories and battery factories. That's a business that is not really core to the cobot space. And so I think that the -- one of the things that's going on is there's significant consumption of electronics into the other parts of the Robotics business, but our business tracks like PMIs and other broader indices a little bit more closely than that longer lead stuff. Yes, so it's -- the -- I don't really think of it in terms of a volume play, because that infers sort of commoditization, and we don't really see that happening. This is a high-tech space where technology differentiation actually matters. Having a better robot, having better software, easier-to-use capabilities, that makes a big difference as does having an ecosystem of partners that can help people build solutions quite quickly. The focus on large accounts, I think of that primarily in terms of our cost of sales, that by concentrating on a smaller number of larger accounts, we can sell more robots per account, and that allows us to grow with -- like that our sales growth will outpace our sales cost growth over time. So I see that as an efficiency game. The comment that you made about hardware versus services, I think that that's an important aspect of our future plans that we think that there are profit pools in retaining an engagement with customers that have bought our product, both in terms of providing service, but more importantly, in terms of providing new types of software, new components that will allow them to get more out of the product in the future. At the end of the day, our robots are really reliable. They don't break that much. So like a break-fix business, I would not expect to be a huge volume generator, but as robots get into more and more critical processes, these customers are going to want to pay for uptime and that's a more lucrative service model. Well, we might want to get a beer to have that conversation. I think that like in a nutshell, we believe in service as a service, right that the models where people are trying to offer hardware that depreciates as a service is largely around who carries the depreciation, and I think it's an interesting model at the low levels of penetration that we have right now in robotics because customers are reluctant. They're worried about making investments that won't pay off. And robots as a service allow them to walk away more easily. We're far more focused on solving those problems so that customers are willing to make those investments, because they're smart enough to figure out if they get a better deal by carrying the depreciation versus paying rent for the robot. And that's basically what you're talking about. Yes. Hello everybody. So High-Bandwidth Memory is certainly one of the leading-edge technologies that is driving some tester sales, some technology-related tester sales, even though overall capacity is down. But it's actually a really small part of the overall memory business. So it's a positive, but I don't think it's nearly as significant as the transition to LPDDR5 or the next generation of flash in terms of driving technology sales. Yes. So in terms of within auto industrial, any parts where we're more dominant, I'd say that the segment where we probably have a leadership position is in power and discrete test that when it comes to gallium nitride, silicon carbide, IGBTs, things like that. Our Eagle product line and the acquisition that we made of Lemsys a few years ago have allowed us to really establish a pretty good position in that space. It's not a huge part of that market, but it is a part of that market that we expect to grow over time. As for China restrictions, we don't know what's going to happen in the future. There is a lot of trailing edge fab capacity coming online in China and we're getting a share of that. There are also -- something that we are on the lookout for is that that is generally producing parts that you don't need a high performance tester to deal with. And there are some smaller test equipment makers locally there that are getting a share of that. So we're watching that, and we're trying to make sure that we protect ourselves against competitive losses."

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Traci Tsuchiguchi. Please go ahead ma'am.\nTraci Tsuchiguchi: Thank you operator. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our discussion of Teradyne's most recent financial results. I'm joined this morning by our CEO, Greg Smith; and our CFO, Sanjay Mehta. Following our opening remarks, we'll provide details of our performance for the third quarter of 2024 and our outlook for the fourth quarter of 2024. The press release containing our third quarter results was issued last evening. We have provided slides as well as a copy of this earnings script on the Investor page of the Teradyne website that may be helpful in following the discussion. Replays of this call will be available via the same page after the call ends. The matters that we discuss today will include forward-looking statements that involve risk factors that could cause Teradyne's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We caution listeners not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements included in this presentation. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor Statement contained in slides accompanying this presentation as well as the risk factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC. Additionally, these forward-looking statements are made only as of today. During today's call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures. We have posted additional information concerning these non-GAAP financial measures including reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures where available on the Investor page of our website. Looking ahead between now and our next earnings call, Teradyne expects to participate in technology or investor-focused conferences, hosted by R.W. Baird and UBS. Additionally, please note that we are planning to host a financial analyst meeting at our headquarters North Reading, Massachusetts in the afternoon of March 11, 2025. Following Greg and Sanjay\u2019s comments this morning will open up the call for questions. This call is scheduled for one hour. Greg.\nGreg Smith: Thanks Traci, good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. Today I will summarize our third quarter results and discuss the trends we are seeing in the semiconductor and advanced robotics industry. Sanjay will then provide more color on our third quarter results and forward-looking guidance. Generally, the market dynamics that we identified in our July earnings call have continued through the third quarter. The ongoing strength of Cloud AI is driving demand in both the SoC and Memory Test markets and our Semi Test business is performing above our expectations. Within Semi Test the memory business delivered record high revenue in the third quarter on a strong HBM demand. Our SoC business was driven by networking and by vertically integrated producers or VIPs who are designing silicon for their own use in Cloud and Edge AI applications. Beyond Compute and Memory we are beginning to see stabilization and in some cases modest levels of improvement in our other Semi Test segments. We are seeing utilization rates continue to tick higher as test was initially purchased from Mobile increasingly being upgraded to test Cloud AI Compute devices. By the beginning of 2024 out lead times have returned to normal and while our customers are not generally providing forecast beyond a quarter or two which limits our visibility, we do expect a broader market recovery as we progress through 2025. Robotics powered by transformation and SAM expansion continues to outpace its peer group as it operates beneath difficult macro industrial environment that has now persisted for more than two years. Focusing in on Q3, we delivered third quarter financial results as the high end of our revenue guidance range and above the high end of our gross margin and earnings guidance ranges. Memory and SoC came in above our plan, driven mainly by AI applications. In Q3, Cloud AI drove Compute Revenue with notable strength in networking devices. As we have discussed in the past, AI-enabled data centers require much denser networks and our incumbent leadership position in networking, combined with shipments to support VIPs has resulted in a considerable shift in our revenue mix. This year we expect our revenue from Compute to be four times what it was in 2023. We are increasing our SoC SAM forecast for the Compute market segment by 200 million from 1.6 billion to 1.8 billion in 2024. This compares to 1.4 billion in 2023, approximately 30% year-over-year TAM growth. The VIP portion of the Compute TAM is growing fast, and our current estimate of this market for 2024 is approximately $300 million, of which we have roughly 50% share. In Memory, AI-driven HBM DRAM demand remains very strong and AI servers are driving demand for enterprise SSD NAND flash. Our memory business is at record levels, driven by volume shipments for DRAM wafer store and HBM stack die test. We are revising our estimated Memory TAM expectation for the year to approximately $1.4 billion, above our prior estimate range of 1.2 to 1.3. The Memory Test for TAM in 2024 is now expected to be over 35% higher than the last peak in 2021. We note that the 2024 Memory TAM includes a big slug of initial tooling for HBM at multiple memory suppliers. It's likely that the HBM-TAM will flatten or reduce in 2025. Moving on to Q4. Cloud AI demand is expected to continue into the fourth quarter. However, given the surge of memory shipments in the third quarter, we expect that our memory revenue will moderate in the fourth. While Semi Test has consistently outperformed our expectations this year, our other test businesses have continued to see softer demand. Our wireless business in particular has been impacted by the slower than expected ramp of Wi-Fi 7 in access points, PCs, and laptops. Our HD business continues to wait for our primary customer to work through capacity, and our Production Board Test business continues to be weak mainly due to lower demand from Tier One Automotive OEMs. Now turning to Robotics. Despite roughly flat quarter-on-quarter revenue, our Robotics business has delivered 8% year-to-date growth despite a worsening industrial macro backdrop. We see our industrial automation peers with year-over-year declines averaging more than 10%. While the basic demand drivers for advanced Robotics remain, low penetration rate, the demographics of an aging population, fewer young workers willing to do factory work, and the compellingly short ROI, the industrial market that we serve is inherently cyclical, and our customers have significantly cut back on capital investment plans. We believe a more appropriate short-term indicator of progress is to consider performance relative to the peer group rather than an absolute growth metric for this business. To consider absolute growth, one needs to look over complete business cycle. Even in the adverse business environment, the Robotics team is seeing good progress in executing its growth strategy. Our highest priority in Robotics go-to-market transformation is the development of an OEM solutions channel for UR. This channel is highly valuable because customers purchasing cobot based solutions from these partners get into production more quickly and have fewer problems than customers that develop custom solutions. In the first three quarters of the year, OEM revenue at UR is up over 50% compared to 2023. Innovation-driven SAM expansion is central to outgrowing the market. The new heavy payload UR robots that began shipping late last year have lasted well in the market and represents 16% of UR units shipped year-to-date. The OEM growth and new product revenue essentially account for Teradyne Robotics outperforming our peer group in budget-constrained market conditions. We expect innovation-driven growth to continue in Q4. The MiR1200 Pallet Jack is a breakthrough product that brings NVIDIA-powered AI to solve a tough problem in the physical industrial world. Our beta customer trials have completed successfully, and we expect commercial shipments to begin late this quarter. Earlier this week, UR launched its AI accelerator, which is a ready-to-use hardware and software toolkit that will reduce time to market for AI-based work cell robotic solutions for UR's partners. To sum up, based on year-to-date outperformance of our Semi Test business and partially offset by the softer environment outside of Semi Test, we expect total company revenue growth of approximately 5%, up from our prior expectation of low single-digit revenue growth from 2023. As a reminder, excluding the impact of the sale of DIS to Technoprobe, our 2024 revenue growth would be a couple of percentage points higher. Our third quarter results have reinforced our belief that AI is a transformational secular growth driver across Teradyne's businesses, both in test and in robotics. It is powering demand in Semi Test and powering innovative products in robotics. We expect that this will only accelerate in the years ahead. With that, I'll turn the call over to Sanjay. Sanjay?\nSanjay Mehta: Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover the financial summary of Q3, provide our Q4 outlook and provide some color around 2025. Now to Q3. Third quarter sales were $737 million, which was at the high end of our guidance with non-GAAP EPS of $0.90, which was above our high-end guide of $0.86. Non-GAAP gross margins were 59.7%, this was above our high guidance due primarily to product mix. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $275 million, up sequentially and year-over-year, consistent with our guidance as we invest in targeted opportunities to drive long-term growth. Non-GAAP operating profit was approximately 22%. Turning to our revenue breakdown in Q3. Semi Test revenue for the quarter was $543 million, with SoC contributing $393 million and Memory $150 million. Strength in SoC was driven by Compute, while Mobile and Industrial continued to ship at a consistent level with Q2. Memory Test revenue was driven by HBM DRAM shipments, flash tooling for new UFS 4.0 standard in Mobility and DRAM wafer sort. In Memory, we continue to expect DRAM to dominate the Memory mix at over 80% of the Memory TAM in 2024. In System Test group, Q3 revenue was $73 million with continued weakness across the businesses. Production Board Test business decline was driven by weakness in the automotive end market. Storage Test weakness in SLT was tied to the mobile end market. While the HDD end market is recovering, the demand is being satisfied with underutilized test capacity. In wireless test, revenue was $33 million in Q3, lower sequentially and year-on-year on a slower-than-expected ramp of WiFi 7 and continued weakness in the PC end market. Now to Robotics. Revenue was approximately $89 million, flattish sequentially and up 3% year-over-year. In the quarter, UR contributed $73 million and MiR contributed $15 million. As noted, although the overall market is down, we are experiencing year-over-year growth tied to our SAM expansion and channel strategies. Some other financial information in Q3. Our equity investment in Technoprobe is reflected below the line in the income statement, where we recognized 10% of TPI's profit one quarter in arrears. Clearly, as the transaction closed at the end of May, our third quarter results reflect the impact of one month of the TPI investment. We had three 10% customers in the quarter. The tax rate, excluding discrete items for the quarter 13.6% on a GAAP basis and 13.8% on a non-GAAP basis. Full year rate is expected to be 14% on a GAAP basis, 14.5% on a non-GAAP basis. Shifting to some cash metrics. At a company level, our free cash flow was $114 million, primarily driven by earnings and net working capital improvements in the quarter. We repurchased $25 million of shares in the quarter and paid $20 million in dividends. We ended the quarter with $678 million in cash and marketable securities. Now to our outlook for Q4. Q4 sales are expected to be between $710 million and $760 million. Gross margins are estimated at 59.5% to 60.5%. Recall in January, we had a plan to improve gross margins back to model in the second half of 2024. The first half of 2024 had subscale revenues tied to a seasonally low Q1 and operational resiliency spend. In the second half of 2024, we are back to our model gross margins of 59% to 60%. A little more color on gross margin seasonality. In Q1 2025, we anticipate revenue to be roughly 5% to 10% down quarter-over-quarter. With this lower volume, our gross margin was expected to be slightly below our target model. Back to Q4, OPEX is expected to run at 36.5% to 38.5% of fourth quarter sales. The non-GAAP operating profit rate at the midpoint of our fourth quarter guidance is 23% with non-GAAP EPS expected to be in the range of $0.80 to $0.97 on 164 million diluted shares. GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.73 to $0.91. A few comments on the semiconductor test market. We are revising up our total semiconductor ATE TAM estimates for 2024. We have provided a slide in the appendix of our earnings deck with this information. Recall, our SoC TAM range has been $3.6 billion to $4.2 billion with a midpoint of $3.9 billion. We now expect the SoC TAM to be at the high end of this range around $4.2 billion. This is comprised of Compute, which we now estimate to be $1.8 billion, up $200 million from our prior midpoint estimate and industrial to be around $400 million, up $100 million from our prior estimate. We continue to estimate mobile to be around $800 million, Auto MCU to be around $500 million, and Services at $700 million. We are also raising our Memory TAM estimate to $1.4 billion, up from an estimated range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. Within our 2024 expectations, as Greg noted, we are calibrating our expectations of growth in Robotics around the relative growth of the peer group. We are targeting growth in our Robotics business to be 15% to 20% above the industrial automation peer group, which contemplates macroeconomic factors that are outside of our control. We are confident in the long-term growth of this business and will continue to have a disciplined approach to spending. Given the weak end market, we now expect Robotics growth in 2024 to be between 5% and 10%. With regard to capital allocation, we will continue to target our share buybacks in 2024 to have an amount necessary to offset dilution from equity compensation and our employee share purchase program. Looking ahead to 2025, with an uptick in utilization and an expectation of end market improvement, we will be making investments that will increase our operating expenses. However, we expect to have a plan with operating leverage. We expect revenue growth to accelerate from 2024 levels across all businesses. That said, demand for most of our end markets outside of AI related to Compute and Memory is improving, but remains muted and the timing and magnitude of a broader-based recovery is not known. Our variable business model is scalable and resilient with outsourced manufacturing and our operating expenses having a variable component. During a cyclical downturn, we shed OPEX enabling greater profitability and free cash flow generation. During an upturn in the market, we expect in 2025, we will see an accelerated OPEX increase tied to our variable OPEX model. In 2025, given our expected top line growth, we are planning a low teens increase in year-over-year OPEX, mainly to fund our Semi Test growth initiatives, primarily in engineering and go-to-market. Also, approximately 30% of the growth is due to our variable compensation model. Q1 OPEX is expected to grow 15% to 20% year-over-year. Summing up, we delivered strong sales and earnings in the third quarter as Memory and Compute revenue helped us drive to the high end of the range. Our Robotics team delivered year-over-year growth despite a difficult auto and industrial end market as the business continues to execute its new product development and go-to-market strategy. Overall, our midterm fundamentals remain strong, and we are investing to accelerate our long-term growth trajectory. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator to open the line-up for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Mehdi Hosseini of SIG. please go ahead.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes, thanks for taking my question. The first one has to do with just the overall system level test, you have highlighted opportunities in Compute I think of System-Level Test as an extension of Compute impacting both your Semi Test and System Level. So remind me, where do you see the TAM in 2024 and your projection for 2025 and what are the opportunities that Teradyne could benefit from? And for context, SLT was mostly opportunities in the smartphone, I'm under impression that the end market diversified, and I want to hear how Teradyne is positioned and I have a follow-up?\nGreg Smith: Hi Mehdi, so unlike the semiconductor ATE market, there aren't as accurate measures of TAM in the SLT space because there are a lot of sort of fuzzy edges between SLT and burn in, different methodologies. So we look more at this from a major customer perspective and a segment perspective. So you're right, the thing that's happened over the past few years, maybe the last like five years or so is SLT becoming an important part of the test strategy for the processors that go into smartphones. And that has been the primary driver for us, our business. Over -- in 2024, we have added Compute customers to that mix. And we're really going to hit more, like I think that's only going to be a meaningful contributor to SLT revenue once we get to 2025. There's a little bit in 2024, there will be more in 2025. We also -- while this -- the mobile downturn has been going on, we have been adding additional -- an additional customer in the mobile space. So when the mobile market hopefully recovers to an extent in 2025, we expect that to grow a little bit more robustly because we have an additional customer there. So I don't have a firm answer to give you, but we certainly believe that we're looking at a significantly stronger 2025 than 2024 in SLT.\nMehdi Hosseini: Sure, thank you. And just as a follow-up, when I asked your customers, it seems like the overall test time for the next generation of AI Blackwell increases by more than 30% versus the prior generation. And I'm just wondering given the fact that you've had limited exposure to accelerate part of the AI market, would the escalating test time open the door for Teradyne to come in and reduce the test time and this is where SLT could potentially become an enabler?\nGreg Smith: The trend that you're talking about higher test times is really firmly tied to the complexity of the device. The Blackwell is a huge die, its test time is quite well optimized to the complexity that's there, and there are -- I see SLT as primarily a way to limit the growth. If the test time tracked with the transistor complexity increase, it would go up by a lot more than 30%. SLT is sort of the backstop that's keeping that growth down, and we have significant opportunities in AI accelerators, but I don't see a significant opportunity for us to gain share with -- in a specific part like Blackwell. Our future is much more strongly tied to the vertically integrated producers. So as the hyperscalers begin to deploy greater amounts of Compute power on their own silicon, that's the thing that's going to be driving our improved results in the Compute space. The other thing about that is coming along with that increased complexity in each of the devices is for -- when you're trying to do AI model training and the number of nodes in the model are increasing and increasing, the amount of networking is actually increasing at a faster pace than the number of nodes. So that is like the mix. If you look within a single company, they have -- they'll have AI accelerators and networking devices, the amount of test seconds required for the networking devices is going up at least as fast as the number of test seconds for the core Compute devices because they're simply more links. So I think there's -- this test time expansion is kind of a broad tailwind for the ATE industry. We're going to be looking at larger TAMs, more testers and I think that the key message is that our primary opportunity is through the growth of the VIPs and networking.\nMehdi Hosseini: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vivek Arya of Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\nVivek Arya: Thank you for taking my question. I'm not sure how the TAM is being taken up several hundred million dollars, but your Q4 and Q1 sales are going to be below Q3 sales. And as we look forward, Greg, do you think that this 20%, 25% sales growth, which is kind of in line with your midterm model CAGR, that's the realistic target for 2025?\nGreg Smith: So let me take this in two parts. So in terms of the TAM expansion, there's three factors -- there's really two factors going on. One is that as we are measuring ourselves and our competitors, we're seeing significantly stronger business in AI Compute and things that are related to that HBM Memory. The other factor is that as the year is going on, we are getting better visibility into the size of the TAM in China and the success of the local Chinese tester companies serving that Chinese TAM. So there's demand from companies in China that's being served by companies in China. And it's not so much that, that is strengthening, but we're getting a clearer picture of how much of that's going on. So because of Teradyne's relatively low exposure in China, that isn't as big of a factor around our share of our growth, but it is certainly something that is accelerating the TAM, our estimate of the TAM in 2024. Now the second part of your question around like our model would suggest growth of 20% to 25% in 2025. We'll be giving you a complete picture of what we believe is -- like what our estimates are for 2025 specifically in our January call. But I think the ingredients are there for us to be able to stay on model towards our 2026 plan.\nVivek Arya: And from a follow-up, if I do a five-year look back for your automation or your Robotics business, the 29% to 24% if my model is right, it shows a 5% CAGR, so what explains that software growth, how does that long-term trend compare against the industry, and what needs to happen for Teradyne to grow at this 20%, 30% forecast for the next handful of years?\nGreg Smith: So that's a really good question. And it's something that we've spent a fair amount of time doing some soul-searching about ourselves. And when we were trying to look at this, we saw a number of different factors. One thing that is -- that has happened is that the -- if you rewind the tape, you had a sort of a 5-year look back, 2020 was an abysmal year for industrial automation in general, but the semiconductor industry recovered very quickly because it was a critical industry during the COVID pandemic and results were really, really strong there. But for industrial automation, including our industrial automation, it was a very, very difficult environment to try to grow sales. There was a strong recovery from that in 2021 and then after that into 2022, our growth really flattened out, and we had negative growth in 2023. In the period from 2023 up through now, actually, the second half of 2022 through now, we've been looking at a very soft end market. The industrial PMI has been at or below 50%, indicating contraction for two years, and that is the longest period of time that, that indicator has been that low for the last 40 years. I'm not sure about the 40 years, a very long time. The -- that coincides with the post-COVID contraction in general and also the period of time when interest rates started going up, making capital tighter for industrial expansion. We haven't been sort of sitting around while that's going on. We have been looking at our own performance and our own issues in that business. And the key thing that we saw in that business was that our distribution was inadequate for the growth objectives that we had and that in order to serve this huge unserved market that we needed to actually broaden our offerings both in hardware and software. And so that's what we've been doing. While this -- while we've had these terrible end market conditions, we've added high payload robots to our UR line. We have -- we're about to introduce a product for MiR that will roughly double our served market. And we've established an effective OEM solutions channel for UR, that's now accounting for a material part of their sales and growing 50% year-over-year in a weak market. So we definitely need better end market conditions than we see right now for us to be able to maintain 20% to 30% growth. But what Sanjay said, I think is right, that we think we can outgrow the sort of traditional suppliers in robotics and industrial automation by 15 to 20 percentage points per year. And that market typically grows a little bit faster than GDP, sort of a 5% growth rate. So that would put us in the 20% to 25% growth just with a \"normal market.\" So I think we're -- we have pretty strong conviction that we've done the right things to set ourselves up for growth, but we're consistently looking at it and adjust it.\nVivek Arya: Thank you Greg.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tim Arcuri of UBS. Please go ahead.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. Sanjay, you guided OPEX next year up low teens, and you talked about how that's going to be focused in Semi Test, but you also said you want to show leverage next year. So implicit in that statement, you think you're going to grow revenue something higher than that. The Street right now has it up low 20s. So is that a reasonable number since you're growing the OPEX up low teens, is the Street projection of up low 20s, is that a reasonable number or do you think you can grow even faster than that?\nSanjay Mehta: Yes, hi Tim. I think it says a couple of things. One is we do have conviction in -- as I noted in my prepared remarks, we believe that across the business, we're going to see an improvement. However, we are in a downturn or a muted set of demand for mobility, auto and industrial. And when that exactly turns will be an interesting dynamic that will fluctuate where we end up in 2025. We will provide a view of 2025 and our January call. But the other implicit point that we wanted to make was, hey, this is a dynamic environment. We're going through our strategic planning process now that culminates with a review with our Board. And then we provide an update to the earnings model in January as we always do. And we're still going through that process. But one of the principles that we look at is how do we have operating leverage. We wanted to put that out there. Now tactically, as we do see that the market's changing pretty significantly, if you go back to 2008, you see mobility being very, very strong. And now obviously, with segment chip to Compute, we believe we're -- as we've noted several years ago, we pivoted to VIP or hyperscaler strategy that is, we feel as being very successful in the short term. And we're making the right engineering and go-to-market decisions, we believe. So tactically, while we have this principle of driving operating leverage, tactically, we are looking at these investments very carefully. But this is where we expect to be. So we wanted to make sure we set the right expectation from our investment profile as well as came out with a principle of operating leverage.\nGreg Smith: If I can just add sort of one comment that as we were looking at our 2026 earnings model and trying to make sure that we were providing useful -- like as much useful information as we can know without having complete plans for 2025, the thing that we were most concerned was that there was a chance that people would misunderstand our trajectory in OPEX going into 2025. We were less concerned about the sort of the impressions that existed, sort of the implication of our 2026 earnings model on 2025, we had less concerns about that in the area of revenue growth.\nTimothy Arcuri: Okay, great, thanks for that. And I mean, obviously, as you guys know, I don't say good things about the industrial automation business often. So I guess maybe I'll ask a question that could be kind of a green shoot question. And if you look at this white paper, I mean, Amazon obviously has Kiva for automated guided robots. But they do have this new white paper where it looks like they're looking to fill a niche with cobots for warehouse and fulfillment, things like that. So is that a green shoot that maybe, I mean, AI obviously hasn't done -- has not grown much. But is that a green shoot that maybe should really start to catalyze that business?\nGreg Smith: So yeah, we don't comment on sort of specific customer engagements, the thing that -- I've seen the same white paper that you've seen. And it is really exciting technology. The thing that's exciting to me is that they're applying AI to allow for cobots to be able to react to deal with like the hundreds of thousands of SKUs that they need to deal with on a day-to-day basis. We have other customers in the logistics space that are using AI and cobots in a very similar way, like cube storage systems for online grocery picking, those kinds of applications. So the green shoot in our mind is how AI can be used to allow cobots to be applied to a much broader range of product -- problems that it's been able to serve before. And I certainly believe that online retailing is one of the richest areas for that to possibly grow.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thank you Greg.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hey, thanks for taking the questions. So for the first one, I'm just trying to go back to your comments on the prepared remarks about growth being significantly higher in 2025, compared to 2024 and just trying to think about it in terms of the TAM by segments that you outlined. And I remember previously, you've outlined that the complete TAM probably is really not where you see a lot of upside into 2025, but more in the cyclical parts of the TAM that you outlined like Mobility and others. I mean more curious if that's still your view as you look forward to 2025, because you just outlined today as well that the memory or the HBM TAM might be sort of flattening out as well. So is it still very much when we start to think about next year significantly actual growth, is it really driven by the cyclical parts of the TAM or is your view changing on Compute or Memory in aggregate in relation to that? And I have a quick follow-up.\nGreg Smith: Yes. So I'll give my usual -- we'll tell you in more detail what our view of 2025 is in January. But since we talked a little bit about this last quarter, what I'll do is I'll sort of give you an update sort of what we've seen to modify that view. So last quarter, we -- like what I was saying last quarter is like man, Compute is hot. I don't -- I can't imagine it's going to get much hotter. You know what, it's probably going to get a bit hotter. It's probably going to grow a bit from where it is now. We certainly are expecting a recovery from the lower levels that we see in 2024 in the automotive and industrial space. There's a lot of end market demand that is going to come. The crossover from internal combustion to EV, even though it's delayed, it's going on in every single model year of car is increasing the semiconductor content. So we see that there are long-term growth drivers that are going to help us in auto and industrial. In Memory, we do think that HBM will moderate, but honestly, the other parts of the memory market are still quite weak. The DRAM market is like -- was it 80% this year of the TAM. And it's usually much more balanced than that. So we think that there's definitely room for improved strength in the flash part of the Memory market. So I think -- I guess the premise of your question is, is it like AI like being the sole growth driver next year, I think that the real story is that the rest of the market kind of improves incrementally underneath a very strong AI market.\nSamik Chatterjee: Got it. Good. That's helpful. And for my second one, just on Sanjay, you mentioned the seasonality into 1Q. If I sort of look at your business as AI versus sort of the more cyclical part, are the AI pieces also going to go through a seasonality typical to the rest of the business or are you seeing those sort of stand out in seasonality and it's more driven by the cyclical aspects that you sort of take that step down into 1Q? Thank you.\nSanjay Mehta: Yes. I think if you look at our history, what you'll see is the seasonality come down in Q1. And we're seeing that in Robotics specifically. Historically, we've seen strong Q4 and then come down in Q1. And then from a test perspective, the AI strength right now, it will be interesting to see because one thing I want to tie back to is that our lead times have come down significantly from where they were several years ago. And one of the drivers of our strength in Q3 was really tied to customers pulling in future forecast to meet current wafer routes and test requirements. And we're seeing that more and more, and we're positioned well to service that. There have been some unforecasted demand. So I would say that the visibility is starting to get a little bit lower looking out into kind of Q1 from a tactical execution perspective. Now we are positioned well that if customers come in and we can service it. But even in test, we are seeing historically a little bit of seasonality, but a large part is driven by Robotics and a little bit in Test.\nSamik Chatterjee: Great, thank you. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Chin of Stifel. Please go ahead. Brian, your line is open if you would ask your question.\nBrian Chin: Hi there, sorry about that. Thanks for letting us ask a few questions, and good morning. Maybe just first question, can you discuss why the industrial test TAM was revised higher for this year, is there a connection to China there or would you explain that in another way?\nGreg Smith: Yes. So you hit the nail on the head. This isn't a case of the industrial TAM lengthening from quarter-to-quarter. It's a case of us getting better visibility into the size of the TAM that existed in China that's being served by indigenous suppliers.\nBrian Chin: Okay, that's very clear and helpful. And Greg, maybe can you also -- you referenced this on prior calls, and I think this as well, but can you help to quantify roughly what percent of the mobile installed tester base, I assume that OSAT principally has been reduced, rationalized, or repurposed for other chips and markets such as AI accelerator GPUs and ASICs?\nGreg Smith: Yes, so right now, like as of today, based on the upgrade shipments that we've done over 100 testers have been repurposed, and by the end of the year, we expect that over 200 testers will have been repurposed into other markets. Most of that isn't to Compute, but not all of it. And the other thing that we look at is to see directionally what's happening with utilization. We don't trust the absolute numbers, but since we keep our measurement methodology consistent, you can get a better idea of whether capacity is getting tighter or looser and we've seen a meaningful uptick in utilization as these testers have been converted and put to use. So we definitely believe that there's less idle capacity now than there was a quarter ago, and they'll be even less when we get the end of the year.\nBrian Chin: That's helpful. You understand kind of the supply side of that and the demand is what you are kind of floating at the moment for next year. Maybe one last quick question. And I understand maybe the reluctance to give a number for 2025 of that VIP Compute TAM. But you revised it higher again for this year. Maybe it will ultimately push higher in terms of what your 2026 view has been. But maybe can you at least talk about the key considerations that maybe drive the size of that opportunity next year and are constraints for things like cobot capacity or HBM supply one of those considerations?\nGreg Smith: Okay, so first, in terms of the VIPs, what we've said before is that by 2026 we believe that the TAM will be about -- for VIP Compute that we believe that TAM will be about $500 million. This year, we believe that TAM is going to be about $300 million. And frankly, that was a positive surprise in terms of the market size for 2024. Because of that, we are currently taking a hard look at whether that $500 million number for 2026 is right, and we'll give you an update in January about whether we think that that's -- that needs to be revised upward. I certainly feel like there's upward pressure on it. The other thing that we've said about the VIP TAM is that because it's so few producers and so few part types, the TAM is really lumpy. So if you strike a winner, you get a big amount of orders in one period of time. And then that capacity gets in place and it's used. So that market has not sort of reached the level of maturity and breadth where you can draw a straight line to say it's this and this year, it's this two years later, therefore, it's going to be halfway in between in the middle year. But the trend is definitely strengthening. Now in terms of the constraints, the things that we are seeing when we talk to VIP customers is that they are constrained in terms of the amount of HBM Memory they can get, they're constrained in the amount of advanced packaging in order to be able to assemble these kinds of parts. Those are probably the two most important constraints. The other thing that I think is an X factor in this space is the part has to work. These are huge dye, reticle constrained dye surprises, and they are designing a fair amount of redundancy into them to try to make sure that they get adequate yields. But this is -- it's not a slam dunk that these parts are going to work the first time around. So the demand for these testers can shift around in time. So it's a kind of a challenging space to predict. But it's definitely -- the trend is moving faster than we thought it would.\nBrian Chin: Yes. That's super helpful color. Thanks Greg.\nOperator: Our next question comes from C.J. Muse of Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.\nChristopher Muse: Yeah, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I guess first question, I realize you want to save the thunder for your Analyst Day in March. But everything that I'm hearing in this call is telling me that 2025 is a transition year. Your OPEX in Q1 is at new highs, while your revenues are 37% below the prior peak. So can you give us a little bit of help here to understand that there's actually real leverage in the model in 2025?\nSanjay Mehta: Yes, hi C.J. So when we take our -- as Greg noted, look, we're going through our strategic planning process. And -- but what we're seeing is early indicators are that we are talking to customers and hearing about their plans. We do -- we have gone through our early market kind of size assessments. And as Greg noted, look, we are seeing incremental or we are planning incremental growth in mobility, auto, industrial. And from a percentage-wise, that's coming off of a low base, so that would be higher, and Compute is doing really well. So we feel comfortable that at this point, with all the facts we have, we did note that we do expect to see operating leverage while we do grow low teens in the way of OPEX. And a lot changes in 90 days. And we've got to complete our planning process, and we'll provide an update. But we feel comfortable that at this point, we expect to see the operating leverage in our business in 2025.\nGreg Smith: Yes. So if I can just add a little bit of add on to that. When we hit our prior peak like the upturn that was serving was it played precisely into Teradyne's strength. Like we are great in mobile, and it was a huge boom in mobile demand. And so we were operating at peak efficiency. We did not need to layer in significant OPEX in order to serve that level of revenue. Coming out of like -- and it's pretty clear from our earnings model that we believe that we are set up for relatively robust TAM growth over the next couple of years. The difference is that, that TAM growth doesn't naturally play to where Teradyne's historic strength was. And so we needed to pivot, and we needed to invest in order to make sure that we were able to reap the benefit of the change in the market. And so we made significant investments to try and align to the HBM market, and we are making significant progress in terms of our exposure and our success in the performance stacked dye test. We made significant investments in engineering and sales and marketing in order to align to VIP, and our share in Compute VIPs is 50% this year versus like much, much lower share in traditional Compute. So like -- the thing that you need to understand is this is a conscious decision on our part that we weren't able to control the changes in the market but we are able to react to it. And to be able to increase our investments moderately while still maintaining very, very good operating margins is the thing that we need to do to try and make sure that we maintain a leadership position in this industry.\nChristopher Muse: That's very helpful, thank you. As my follow-up, a near-term question on Robotics, it looks like you're guiding that business to grow 50% sequentially in December. Can you kind of walk through the drivers there and how to think of what the business will look like after that, I believe that's driven primarily by mere product cycle, but would love to hear more color there? Thank you.\nGreg Smith: Yes. So the Robotics business has historically had very, very large Q4. There's a lot of seasonality in that business, and this year is no exception, that we expect sort of the normal seasonality pattern. We also expect that the growth that we're seeing in the OEM channel and with heavy payload is going to continue to contribute. I also note, like it's a lesser factor, but now there's a more meaningful amount of service revenue that's coming into those businesses. So the -- like the near story is much more of a 2025 story than a 2024 story. We need to get our new Pallet Jack into the hands of customers. That is going to happen at the end of this quarter, but it's not going to be a material contributor to Q4 growth. So it's really more a view of the pipeline that we have, like our lead pipeline for Q4, how strong we expect that business to be from what we have going now than any contribution from like a mere new product.\nChristopher Muse: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nToshiya Hari: Hi, good morning. I had two questions as well. First, on the mobile SoC Test TAM. I know you're not giving guidance for 2025 but Greg, I'm curious how you're thinking about the opportunity set medium to long term. I think the market peaked around $2 billion a couple of years ago, several years ago, you are at $800 million today, how do you think about sort of the through cycle, I know there is no steady state, but how do you think about sort of the through cycle opportunity for mobile, you talked about utilization rates coming up per year market intel, but medium to long term, are you thinking $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion for Mobile Test and some of the reasons behind that, that would be super helpful?\nGreg Smith: Yes. So I think once we get to a steady state in terms of like having shoot up the excess capacity, and I think that happens in 2025. I think the kind of -- like I would expect that the floor in mobile is going to be closer to $1 billion than the $800 million that it is now. But up from that is really going to depend on whether AI-enabled smartphones are a thing or not, and whether AI-enabled smartphones deliver compelling customer value because that's a [indiscernible] in terms of the market. If a phone comes out that has -- that like has a much more complex processor, that's going to require more test time, which means that you need more testers to do it. And if it offers features that customers want badly enough, then that drives the refresh cycle down. And right now, like the average age of smartphones is older now than it's ever been, that people have been holding on to their phones much longer because there really hasn't been that compelling new feature that drives people to upgrade. So I really think that upside to like a $1 billion level in mobile is going to depend on whether the refresh rate in phones goes up and phone unit volume goes up.\nToshiya Hari: Got it, thank you. And then as my follow-up, just a question on how you're thinking about the overall business portfolio. It's been, I think, something like eight years since you guys acquired UR and I know that it predates you becoming CEO of the company. But since then, I think at the time, I think the growth expectation around Semi Test was lower perhaps than how you're thinking about the business today and I think the market sort of perceived the acquisition as a diversification play. When you think about the opportunity set today, I think you've got a lot going on in Semi Test and you touched on quite of those, quite a few of those things, whether it be HBM or the VIP opportunity set. I guess to ask the question bluntly, do you feel like you're still the right owner of the Robotics business, do you feel like you're getting fair value for running this business, and do you guys ever internally debate separating the two businesses? Thanks.\nGreg Smith: Yes. No, that is a remarkably blunt question, but it's fair. So -- and you're right in terms of the initial motivation that, the way the world looked to us in 2015 when we bought UR was that we were coming out of like a decade of shrinking TAMs in the semiconductor test market. And over that same decade, Paradigm also doubled our share in the semiconductor test market. So look, in that environment we managed to become more profitable. We've managed to essentially double our share position, but we didn't see that as a great long-term growth strategy. Like you can end up owning up a market that goes away. That's not particularly satisfying. So we were definitely on the hunt for a way to ensure the long-term growth of the enterprise. That was our original motivation. The thing that we have discovered since we bought these Robotics companies is that Paradigm essentially presents a unique value proposition in the advanced robotics space, that if you look at the people that can compete with us in the industrial automation world, the folks that are coming from industrial robots and industrial automation, the big players, they are typically not as comfortable in terms of delivering very high-tech products with very, very high tech -- very, very high reliability requirements. What we do with testers is honestly kind of astonishing. The level of reliability and the level of complexity is really kind of off the charts. And being able to bring that mindset and that skill set to our robotics businesses and also that reputation to our robotics businesses allows them to really compete well against the traditional IA folks that are pivoting into the advanced robotics space. And it gives us a killer advantage against the pure play advanced robotics folks because they're typically undersized, they are underscaled, they are spending beyond -- they are spending to a loss and they don\u2019t have international distribution or a spares logistics network. And so we kind of think that we are the right player to bring advanced robotics to an industrial scale. So the base that we have is, is there some point in the future where we -- where we may unlock shareholder value by having these two businesses be separate? Maybe. But right now, we think that like the Teradyne is like attaching Teradyne to the advanced robotics name is actually a significant differentiator and will allow us to lead in that space.\nToshiya Hari: Thanks so much Greg.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Krish Sankar of TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nKrish Sankar: Yeah, hi, thanks for taking my question. Greg, I had two of them. First one, I just want to come back to this OPEX thing either for Greg or Sanjay. I thought the strategy on the Semi Test side was with VIPs to engage earlier and on the GPU customer side was to get into the networking test side. With this Semi Test OPEX increase, are you trying to build new platforms to compete, I am basically trying to understand if this is a structurally new OPEX level for the Semi Test business or is it just cyclical trying to get market share?\nGreg Smith: So, I would consider it more to be cyclical. It is not and for sure we are always trying to get more market share, right. So, that is kind of a given. But the thing that we are seeing is that these VIP customers they are building extremely complex devices and they amount of applications and technical support require to help them get to market is significant and it is worth it. If you invest that money with that team then you end up with a part that drives a significant amount of business. So the ROI is there to make those investments, but those investments right now we are definitely in the phase where we are making more investments than we are reaping the results of them. So, I think it is a cyclical effect, long-term I would expect that we would be able to -- like I think we will grow revenue into the OPEX that we are taking on. Not reduce OPEX against normal revenue. So, that\u2019s sort of the view that we have that by treading in place of these VIP and networking spaces that we are going to be able to hold and grow without proportionally increasing OPEX the whole way.\nKrish Sankar: Got it, got it. It is very helpful Greg. And then a quick follow-up on HBM. Can you give a little bit of bulk year opportunity in the market share that in the post stack dye cast [ph]?\nGreg Smith: Okay, so on post stack dye cast that\u2019s a market that Paradigm was not able to participate in. And how we were qualified by major supplier in the middle of this year. And so we had significant [Technical Difficulty] stack dye performance test in the second half of this year from one of the major HBM suppliers. We are in core [ph] an additional HBM supplier and that is something that we would expect to drive some revenue in 2025 depending on the success of that particular supplier to get shared. Now when it comes to wafer store, that\u2019s really more aligned to sort of the traditional market share breakdown in the wafer storage space. So if you look at the -- this, there is a few important memory players. We have great DRAM wafer store share by one of the majors. We don\u2019t have much [indiscernible] share at the biggest. And we have -- we are doing well in the Memory manufacturers that are in China. So, as they grow we will do well as well. So, I think wafer store is probably the share space in -- is going to stay about the same but we are going to be gaining share.\nKrish Sankar: Thanks a lot Greg, very helpful.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Gus Richard of Northland Capital. Please go ahead.\nGus Richard: Yeah, thanks for taking my question. I just want to ask about your expectations for complexity growth and mobile processors in next generation next year inclusion of more AI capability, perhaps integration of modem. Do you have any thoughts or any thoughts on what that might look like in 2025?\nGreg Smith: Yeah, it is an interesting take. The devices that are going to ramp next year is at the Test Chip phase now and we expect that there is modest complexity increases and a lot of that complexity increases is associated with AI. Modems is a different story. We don\u2019t see a trans towards additional modem integration. But we do see the opportunity for changes in supply chain [Technical Difficulty] begin to get modems from different sources than they get now. So, that is at play both in the iOS and the Android space. So, we don\u2019t see modem integration but we do see sort shifts in terms of who is providing the modems.\nGus Richard: Great, that is super helpful. And then just touching on capacity utilization. You indicated it will rub sequentially and at this point if you could quantify that a bit more what was it in Q3, what you are thinking Q2, Q3, and Q4 how is that supposed to be utilization trended, can you quantify that?\nGreg Smith: I wish I could but I can\u2019t. So I can say that -- so we have the numbers and we use them internally and we don\u2019t feel that they are well enough audited to use them externally in this way. The only thing that I can tell you is that it\u2019s up a fair amount quarter-on-quarter, sort of mid- to high single digits range. But I don't really want to give absolute numbers because it's hard for us to do audit. And whether that continues in the fourth quarter, my expectation is that we will see significant continued increases in utilization in Q4, both because of normal seasonality and also because of the number of testers that we have upgrade kits to go from one market to another. Like someone is not going to upgrade a utilized tester to use it someplace else. They're going to upgrade an underutilized tester. So that's probably going to slide a bunch of testers from the unutilized column into the utilized column. So I think there's going to be additional improvement in utilization in Q4, but I can't give you a hard number.\nGus Richard: Got it, thanks so much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I will now hand over to Traci Tsuchiguchi for closing remarks.\nTraci Tsuchiguchi: Thanks so much for joining us this morning. We look forward to speaking with many of you through the course of this quarter. Thanks again.\nOperator: Thank you.",

            "name": "Sanjay Mehta",
            "content": "Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover the financial summary of Q3, provide our Q4 outlook and provide some color around 2025. Now to Q3. Third quarter sales were $737 million, which was at the high end of our guidance with non-GAAP EPS of $0.90, which was above our high-end guide of $0.86. Non-GAAP gross margins were 59.7%, this was above our high guidance due primarily to product mix. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $275 million, up sequentially and year-over-year, consistent with our guidance as we invest in targeted opportunities to drive long-term growth. Non-GAAP operating profit was approximately 22%. Turning to our revenue breakdown in Q3. Semi Test revenue for the quarter was $543 million, with SoC contributing $393 million and Memory $150 million. Strength in SoC was driven by Compute, while Mobile and Industrial continued to ship at a consistent level with Q2. Memory Test revenue was driven by HBM DRAM shipments, flash tooling for new UFS 4.0 standard in Mobility and DRAM wafer sort. In Memory, we continue to expect DRAM to dominate the Memory mix at over 80% of the Memory TAM in 2024. In System Test group, Q3 revenue was $73 million with continued weakness across the businesses. Production Board Test business decline was driven by weakness in the automotive end market. Storage Test weakness in SLT was tied to the mobile end market. While the HDD end market is recovering, the demand is being satisfied with underutilized test capacity. In wireless test, revenue was $33 million in Q3, lower sequentially and year-on-year on a slower-than-expected ramp of WiFi 7 and continued weakness in the PC end market. Now to Robotics. Revenue was approximately $89 million, flattish sequentially and up 3% year-over-year. In the quarter, UR contributed $73 million and MiR contributed $15 million. As noted, although the overall market is down, we are experiencing year-over-year growth tied to our SAM expansion and channel strategies. Some other financial information in Q3. Our equity investment in Technoprobe is reflected below the line in the income statement, where we recognized 10% of TPI's profit one quarter in arrears. Clearly, as the transaction closed at the end of May, our third quarter results reflect the impact of one month of the TPI investment. We had three 10% customers in the quarter. The tax rate, excluding discrete items for the quarter 13.6% on a GAAP basis and 13.8% on a non-GAAP basis. Full year rate is expected to be 14% on a GAAP basis, 14.5% on a non-GAAP basis. Shifting to some cash metrics. At a company level, our free cash flow was $114 million, primarily driven by earnings and net working capital improvements in the quarter. We repurchased $25 million of shares in the quarter and paid $20 million in dividends. We ended the quarter with $678 million in cash and marketable securities. Now to our outlook for Q4. Q4 sales are expected to be between $710 million and $760 million. Gross margins are estimated at 59.5% to 60.5%. Recall in January, we had a plan to improve gross margins back to model in the second half of 2024. The first half of 2024 had subscale revenues tied to a seasonally low Q1 and operational resiliency spend. In the second half of 2024, we are back to our model gross margins of 59% to 60%. A little more color on gross margin seasonality. In Q1 2025, we anticipate revenue to be roughly 5% to 10% down quarter-over-quarter. With this lower volume, our gross margin was expected to be slightly below our target model. Back to Q4, OPEX is expected to run at 36.5% to 38.5% of fourth quarter sales. The non-GAAP operating profit rate at the midpoint of our fourth quarter guidance is 23% with non-GAAP EPS expected to be in the range of $0.80 to $0.97 on 164 million diluted shares. GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.73 to $0.91. A few comments on the semiconductor test market. We are revising up our total semiconductor ATE TAM estimates for 2024. We have provided a slide in the appendix of our earnings deck with this information. Recall, our SoC TAM range has been $3.6 billion to $4.2 billion with a midpoint of $3.9 billion. We now expect the SoC TAM to be at the high end of this range around $4.2 billion. This is comprised of Compute, which we now estimate to be $1.8 billion, up $200 million from our prior midpoint estimate and industrial to be around $400 million, up $100 million from our prior estimate. We continue to estimate mobile to be around $800 million, Auto MCU to be around $500 million, and Services at $700 million. We are also raising our Memory TAM estimate to $1.4 billion, up from an estimated range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. Within our 2024 expectations, as Greg noted, we are calibrating our expectations of growth in Robotics around the relative growth of the peer group. We are targeting growth in our Robotics business to be 15% to 20% above the industrial automation peer group, which contemplates macroeconomic factors that are outside of our control. We are confident in the long-term growth of this business and will continue to have a disciplined approach to spending. Given the weak end market, we now expect Robotics growth in 2024 to be between 5% and 10%. With regard to capital allocation, we will continue to target our share buybacks in 2024 to have an amount necessary to offset dilution from equity compensation and our employee share purchase program. Looking ahead to 2025, with an uptick in utilization and an expectation of end market improvement, we will be making investments that will increase our operating expenses. However, we expect to have a plan with operating leverage. We expect revenue growth to accelerate from 2024 levels across all businesses. That said, demand for most of our end markets outside of AI related to Compute and Memory is improving, but remains muted and the timing and magnitude of a broader-based recovery is not known. Our variable business model is scalable and resilient with outsourced manufacturing and our operating expenses having a variable component. During a cyclical downturn, we shed OPEX enabling greater profitability and free cash flow generation. During an upturn in the market, we expect in 2025, we will see an accelerated OPEX increase tied to our variable OPEX model. In 2025, given our expected top line growth, we are planning a low teens increase in year-over-year OPEX, mainly to fund our Semi Test growth initiatives, primarily in engineering and go-to-market. Also, approximately 30% of the growth is due to our variable compensation model. Q1 OPEX is expected to grow 15% to 20% year-over-year. Summing up, we delivered strong sales and earnings in the third quarter as Memory and Compute revenue helped us drive to the high end of the range. Our Robotics team delivered year-over-year growth despite a difficult auto and industrial end market as the business continues to execute its new product development and go-to-market strategy. Overall, our midterm fundamentals remain strong, and we are investing to accelerate our long-term growth trajectory. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator to open the line-up for questions. Operator? Yes, hi Tim. I think it says a couple of things. One is we do have conviction in -- as I noted in my prepared remarks, we believe that across the business, we're going to see an improvement. However, we are in a downturn or a muted set of demand for mobility, auto and industrial. And when that exactly turns will be an interesting dynamic that will fluctuate where we end up in 2025. We will provide a view of 2025 and our January call. But the other implicit point that we wanted to make was, hey, this is a dynamic environment. We're going through our strategic planning process now that culminates with a review with our Board. And then we provide an update to the earnings model in January as we always do. And we're still going through that process. But one of the principles that we look at is how do we have operating leverage. We wanted to put that out there. Now tactically, as we do see that the market's changing pretty significantly, if you go back to 2008, you see mobility being very, very strong. And now obviously, with segment chip to Compute, we believe we're -- as we've noted several years ago, we pivoted to VIP or hyperscaler strategy that is, we feel as being very successful in the short term. And we're making the right engineering and go-to-market decisions, we believe. So tactically, while we have this principle of driving operating leverage, tactically, we are looking at these investments very carefully. But this is where we expect to be. So we wanted to make sure we set the right expectation from our investment profile as well as came out with a principle of operating leverage. Yes. I think if you look at our history, what you'll see is the seasonality come down in Q1. And we're seeing that in Robotics specifically. Historically, we've seen strong Q4 and then come down in Q1. And then from a test perspective, the AI strength right now, it will be interesting to see because one thing I want to tie back to is that our lead times have come down significantly from where they were several years ago. And one of the drivers of our strength in Q3 was really tied to customers pulling in future forecast to meet current wafer routes and test requirements. And we're seeing that more and more, and we're positioned well to service that. There have been some unforecasted demand. So I would say that the visibility is starting to get a little bit lower looking out into kind of Q1 from a tactical execution perspective. Now we are positioned well that if customers come in and we can service it. But even in test, we are seeing historically a little bit of seasonality, but a large part is driven by Robotics and a little bit in Test. Yes, hi C.J. So when we take our -- as Greg noted, look, we're going through our strategic planning process. And -- but what we're seeing is early indicators are that we are talking to customers and hearing about their plans. We do -- we have gone through our early market kind of size assessments. And as Greg noted, look, we are seeing incremental or we are planning incremental growth in mobility, auto, industrial. And from a percentage-wise, that's coming off of a low base, so that would be higher, and Compute is doing really well. So we feel comfortable that at this point, with all the facts we have, we did note that we do expect to see operating leverage while we do grow low teens in the way of OPEX. And a lot changes in 90 days. And we've got to complete our planning process, and we'll provide an update. But we feel comfortable that at this point, we expect to see the operating leverage in our business in 2025."

            "content": "Thanks Traci, good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. Today I will summarize our third quarter results and discuss the trends we are seeing in the semiconductor and advanced robotics industry. Sanjay will then provide more color on our third quarter results and forward-looking guidance. Generally, the market dynamics that we identified in our July earnings call have continued through the third quarter. The ongoing strength of Cloud AI is driving demand in both the SoC and Memory Test markets and our Semi Test business is performing above our expectations. Within Semi Test the memory business delivered record high revenue in the third quarter on a strong HBM demand. Our SoC business was driven by networking and by vertically integrated producers or VIPs who are designing silicon for their own use in Cloud and Edge AI applications. Beyond Compute and Memory we are beginning to see stabilization and in some cases modest levels of improvement in our other Semi Test segments. We are seeing utilization rates continue to tick higher as test was initially purchased from Mobile increasingly being upgraded to test Cloud AI Compute devices. By the beginning of 2024 out lead times have returned to normal and while our customers are not generally providing forecast beyond a quarter or two which limits our visibility, we do expect a broader market recovery as we progress through 2025. Robotics powered by transformation and SAM expansion continues to outpace its peer group as it operates beneath difficult macro industrial environment that has now persisted for more than two years. Focusing in on Q3, we delivered third quarter financial results as the high end of our revenue guidance range and above the high end of our gross margin and earnings guidance ranges. Memory and SoC came in above our plan, driven mainly by AI applications. In Q3, Cloud AI drove Compute Revenue with notable strength in networking devices. As we have discussed in the past, AI-enabled data centers require much denser networks and our incumbent leadership position in networking, combined with shipments to support VIPs has resulted in a considerable shift in our revenue mix. This year we expect our revenue from Compute to be four times what it was in 2023. We are increasing our SoC SAM forecast for the Compute market segment by 200 million from 1.6 billion to 1.8 billion in 2024. This compares to 1.4 billion in 2023, approximately 30% year-over-year TAM growth. The VIP portion of the Compute TAM is growing fast, and our current estimate of this market for 2024 is approximately $300 million, of which we have roughly 50% share. In Memory, AI-driven HBM DRAM demand remains very strong and AI servers are driving demand for enterprise SSD NAND flash. Our memory business is at record levels, driven by volume shipments for DRAM wafer store and HBM stack die test. We are revising our estimated Memory TAM expectation for the year to approximately $1.4 billion, above our prior estimate range of 1.2 to 1.3. The Memory Test for TAM in 2024 is now expected to be over 35% higher than the last peak in 2021. We note that the 2024 Memory TAM includes a big slug of initial tooling for HBM at multiple memory suppliers. It's likely that the HBM-TAM will flatten or reduce in 2025. Moving on to Q4. Cloud AI demand is expected to continue into the fourth quarter. However, given the surge of memory shipments in the third quarter, we expect that our memory revenue will moderate in the fourth. While Semi Test has consistently outperformed our expectations this year, our other test businesses have continued to see softer demand. Our wireless business in particular has been impacted by the slower than expected ramp of Wi-Fi 7 in access points, PCs, and laptops. Our HD business continues to wait for our primary customer to work through capacity, and our Production Board Test business continues to be weak mainly due to lower demand from Tier One Automotive OEMs. Now turning to Robotics. Despite roughly flat quarter-on-quarter revenue, our Robotics business has delivered 8% year-to-date growth despite a worsening industrial macro backdrop. We see our industrial automation peers with year-over-year declines averaging more than 10%. While the basic demand drivers for advanced Robotics remain, low penetration rate, the demographics of an aging population, fewer young workers willing to do factory work, and the compellingly short ROI, the industrial market that we serve is inherently cyclical, and our customers have significantly cut back on capital investment plans. We believe a more appropriate short-term indicator of progress is to consider performance relative to the peer group rather than an absolute growth metric for this business. To consider absolute growth, one needs to look over complete business cycle. Even in the adverse business environment, the Robotics team is seeing good progress in executing its growth strategy. Our highest priority in Robotics go-to-market transformation is the development of an OEM solutions channel for UR. This channel is highly valuable because customers purchasing cobot based solutions from these partners get into production more quickly and have fewer problems than customers that develop custom solutions. In the first three quarters of the year, OEM revenue at UR is up over 50% compared to 2023. Innovation-driven SAM expansion is central to outgrowing the market. The new heavy payload UR robots that began shipping late last year have lasted well in the market and represents 16% of UR units shipped year-to-date. The OEM growth and new product revenue essentially account for Teradyne Robotics outperforming our peer group in budget-constrained market conditions. We expect innovation-driven growth to continue in Q4. The MiR1200 Pallet Jack is a breakthrough product that brings NVIDIA-powered AI to solve a tough problem in the physical industrial world. Our beta customer trials have completed successfully, and we expect commercial shipments to begin late this quarter. Earlier this week, UR launched its AI accelerator, which is a ready-to-use hardware and software toolkit that will reduce time to market for AI-based work cell robotic solutions for UR's partners. To sum up, based on year-to-date outperformance of our Semi Test business and partially offset by the softer environment outside of Semi Test, we expect total company revenue growth of approximately 5%, up from our prior expectation of low single-digit revenue growth from 2023. As a reminder, excluding the impact of the sale of DIS to Technoprobe, our 2024 revenue growth would be a couple of percentage points higher. Our third quarter results have reinforced our belief that AI is a transformational secular growth driver across Teradyne's businesses, both in test and in robotics. It is powering demand in Semi Test and powering innovative products in robotics. We expect that this will only accelerate in the years ahead. With that, I'll turn the call over to Sanjay. Sanjay? Hi Mehdi, so unlike the semiconductor ATE market, there aren't as accurate measures of TAM in the SLT space because there are a lot of sort of fuzzy edges between SLT and burn in, different methodologies. So we look more at this from a major customer perspective and a segment perspective. So you're right, the thing that's happened over the past few years, maybe the last like five years or so is SLT becoming an important part of the test strategy for the processors that go into smartphones. And that has been the primary driver for us, our business. Over -- in 2024, we have added Compute customers to that mix. And we're really going to hit more, like I think that's only going to be a meaningful contributor to SLT revenue once we get to 2025. There's a little bit in 2024, there will be more in 2025. We also -- while this -- the mobile downturn has been going on, we have been adding additional -- an additional customer in the mobile space. So when the mobile market hopefully recovers to an extent in 2025, we expect that to grow a little bit more robustly because we have an additional customer there. So I don't have a firm answer to give you, but we certainly believe that we're looking at a significantly stronger 2025 than 2024 in SLT. The trend that you're talking about higher test times is really firmly tied to the complexity of the device. The Blackwell is a huge die, its test time is quite well optimized to the complexity that's there, and there are -- I see SLT as primarily a way to limit the growth. If the test time tracked with the transistor complexity increase, it would go up by a lot more than 30%. SLT is sort of the backstop that's keeping that growth down, and we have significant opportunities in AI accelerators, but I don't see a significant opportunity for us to gain share with -- in a specific part like Blackwell. Our future is much more strongly tied to the vertically integrated producers. So as the hyperscalers begin to deploy greater amounts of Compute power on their own silicon, that's the thing that's going to be driving our improved results in the Compute space. The other thing about that is coming along with that increased complexity in each of the devices is for -- when you're trying to do AI model training and the number of nodes in the model are increasing and increasing, the amount of networking is actually increasing at a faster pace than the number of nodes. So that is like the mix. If you look within a single company, they have -- they'll have AI accelerators and networking devices, the amount of test seconds required for the networking devices is going up at least as fast as the number of test seconds for the core Compute devices because they're simply more links. So I think there's -- this test time expansion is kind of a broad tailwind for the ATE industry. We're going to be looking at larger TAMs, more testers and I think that the key message is that our primary opportunity is through the growth of the VIPs and networking. So let me take this in two parts. So in terms of the TAM expansion, there's three factors -- there's really two factors going on. One is that as we are measuring ourselves and our competitors, we're seeing significantly stronger business in AI Compute and things that are related to that HBM Memory. The other factor is that as the year is going on, we are getting better visibility into the size of the TAM in China and the success of the local Chinese tester companies serving that Chinese TAM. So there's demand from companies in China that's being served by companies in China. And it's not so much that, that is strengthening, but we're getting a clearer picture of how much of that's going on. So because of Teradyne's relatively low exposure in China, that isn't as big of a factor around our share of our growth, but it is certainly something that is accelerating the TAM, our estimate of the TAM in 2024. Now the second part of your question around like our model would suggest growth of 20% to 25% in 2025. We'll be giving you a complete picture of what we believe is -- like what our estimates are for 2025 specifically in our January call. But I think the ingredients are there for us to be able to stay on model towards our 2026 plan. So that's a really good question. And it's something that we've spent a fair amount of time doing some soul-searching about ourselves. And when we were trying to look at this, we saw a number of different factors. One thing that is -- that has happened is that the -- if you rewind the tape, you had a sort of a 5-year look back, 2020 was an abysmal year for industrial automation in general, but the semiconductor industry recovered very quickly because it was a critical industry during the COVID pandemic and results were really, really strong there. But for industrial automation, including our industrial automation, it was a very, very difficult environment to try to grow sales. There was a strong recovery from that in 2021 and then after that into 2022, our growth really flattened out, and we had negative growth in 2023. In the period from 2023 up through now, actually, the second half of 2022 through now, we've been looking at a very soft end market. The industrial PMI has been at or below 50%, indicating contraction for two years, and that is the longest period of time that, that indicator has been that low for the last 40 years. I'm not sure about the 40 years, a very long time. The -- that coincides with the post-COVID contraction in general and also the period of time when interest rates started going up, making capital tighter for industrial expansion. We haven't been sort of sitting around while that's going on. We have been looking at our own performance and our own issues in that business. And the key thing that we saw in that business was that our distribution was inadequate for the growth objectives that we had and that in order to serve this huge unserved market that we needed to actually broaden our offerings both in hardware and software. And so that's what we've been doing. While this -- while we've had these terrible end market conditions, we've added high payload robots to our UR line. We have -- we're about to introduce a product for MiR that will roughly double our served market. And we've established an effective OEM solutions channel for UR, that's now accounting for a material part of their sales and growing 50% year-over-year in a weak market. So we definitely need better end market conditions than we see right now for us to be able to maintain 20% to 30% growth. But what Sanjay said, I think is right, that we think we can outgrow the sort of traditional suppliers in robotics and industrial automation by 15 to 20 percentage points per year. And that market typically grows a little bit faster than GDP, sort of a 5% growth rate. So that would put us in the 20% to 25% growth just with a \"normal market.\" So I think we're -- we have pretty strong conviction that we've done the right things to set ourselves up for growth, but we're consistently looking at it and adjust it. If I can just add sort of one comment that as we were looking at our 2026 earnings model and trying to make sure that we were providing useful -- like as much useful information as we can know without having complete plans for 2025, the thing that we were most concerned was that there was a chance that people would misunderstand our trajectory in OPEX going into 2025. We were less concerned about the sort of the impressions that existed, sort of the implication of our 2026 earnings model on 2025, we had less concerns about that in the area of revenue growth. So yeah, we don't comment on sort of specific customer engagements, the thing that -- I've seen the same white paper that you've seen. And it is really exciting technology. The thing that's exciting to me is that they're applying AI to allow for cobots to be able to react to deal with like the hundreds of thousands of SKUs that they need to deal with on a day-to-day basis. We have other customers in the logistics space that are using AI and cobots in a very similar way, like cube storage systems for online grocery picking, those kinds of applications. So the green shoot in our mind is how AI can be used to allow cobots to be applied to a much broader range of product -- problems that it's been able to serve before. And I certainly believe that online retailing is one of the richest areas for that to possibly grow. Yes. So I'll give my usual -- we'll tell you in more detail what our view of 2025 is in January. But since we talked a little bit about this last quarter, what I'll do is I'll sort of give you an update sort of what we've seen to modify that view. So last quarter, we -- like what I was saying last quarter is like man, Compute is hot. I don't -- I can't imagine it's going to get much hotter. You know what, it's probably going to get a bit hotter. It's probably going to grow a bit from where it is now. We certainly are expecting a recovery from the lower levels that we see in 2024 in the automotive and industrial space. There's a lot of end market demand that is going to come. The crossover from internal combustion to EV, even though it's delayed, it's going on in every single model year of car is increasing the semiconductor content. So we see that there are long-term growth drivers that are going to help us in auto and industrial. In Memory, we do think that HBM will moderate, but honestly, the other parts of the memory market are still quite weak. The DRAM market is like -- was it 80% this year of the TAM. And it's usually much more balanced than that. So we think that there's definitely room for improved strength in the flash part of the Memory market. So I think -- I guess the premise of your question is, is it like AI like being the sole growth driver next year, I think that the real story is that the rest of the market kind of improves incrementally underneath a very strong AI market. Yes. So you hit the nail on the head. This isn't a case of the industrial TAM lengthening from quarter-to-quarter. It's a case of us getting better visibility into the size of the TAM that existed in China that's being served by indigenous suppliers. Yes, so right now, like as of today, based on the upgrade shipments that we've done over 100 testers have been repurposed, and by the end of the year, we expect that over 200 testers will have been repurposed into other markets. Most of that isn't to Compute, but not all of it. And the other thing that we look at is to see directionally what's happening with utilization. We don't trust the absolute numbers, but since we keep our measurement methodology consistent, you can get a better idea of whether capacity is getting tighter or looser and we've seen a meaningful uptick in utilization as these testers have been converted and put to use. So we definitely believe that there's less idle capacity now than there was a quarter ago, and they'll be even less when we get the end of the year. Okay, so first, in terms of the VIPs, what we've said before is that by 2026 we believe that the TAM will be about -- for VIP Compute that we believe that TAM will be about $500 million. This year, we believe that TAM is going to be about $300 million. And frankly, that was a positive surprise in terms of the market size for 2024. Because of that, we are currently taking a hard look at whether that $500 million number for 2026 is right, and we'll give you an update in January about whether we think that that's -- that needs to be revised upward. I certainly feel like there's upward pressure on it. The other thing that we've said about the VIP TAM is that because it's so few producers and so few part types, the TAM is really lumpy. So if you strike a winner, you get a big amount of orders in one period of time. And then that capacity gets in place and it's used. So that market has not sort of reached the level of maturity and breadth where you can draw a straight line to say it's this and this year, it's this two years later, therefore, it's going to be halfway in between in the middle year. But the trend is definitely strengthening. Now in terms of the constraints, the things that we are seeing when we talk to VIP customers is that they are constrained in terms of the amount of HBM Memory they can get, they're constrained in the amount of advanced packaging in order to be able to assemble these kinds of parts. Those are probably the two most important constraints. The other thing that I think is an X factor in this space is the part has to work. These are huge dye, reticle constrained dye surprises, and they are designing a fair amount of redundancy into them to try to make sure that they get adequate yields. But this is -- it's not a slam dunk that these parts are going to work the first time around. So the demand for these testers can shift around in time. So it's a kind of a challenging space to predict. But it's definitely -- the trend is moving faster than we thought it would. Yes. So if I can just add a little bit of add on to that. When we hit our prior peak like the upturn that was serving was it played precisely into Teradyne's strength. Like we are great in mobile, and it was a huge boom in mobile demand. And so we were operating at peak efficiency. We did not need to layer in significant OPEX in order to serve that level of revenue. Coming out of like -- and it's pretty clear from our earnings model that we believe that we are set up for relatively robust TAM growth over the next couple of years. The difference is that, that TAM growth doesn't naturally play to where Teradyne's historic strength was. And so we needed to pivot, and we needed to invest in order to make sure that we were able to reap the benefit of the change in the market. And so we made significant investments to try and align to the HBM market, and we are making significant progress in terms of our exposure and our success in the performance stacked dye test. We made significant investments in engineering and sales and marketing in order to align to VIP, and our share in Compute VIPs is 50% this year versus like much, much lower share in traditional Compute. So like -- the thing that you need to understand is this is a conscious decision on our part that we weren't able to control the changes in the market but we are able to react to it. And to be able to increase our investments moderately while still maintaining very, very good operating margins is the thing that we need to do to try and make sure that we maintain a leadership position in this industry. Yes. So the Robotics business has historically had very, very large Q4. There's a lot of seasonality in that business, and this year is no exception, that we expect sort of the normal seasonality pattern. We also expect that the growth that we're seeing in the OEM channel and with heavy payload is going to continue to contribute. I also note, like it's a lesser factor, but now there's a more meaningful amount of service revenue that's coming into those businesses. So the -- like the near story is much more of a 2025 story than a 2024 story. We need to get our new Pallet Jack into the hands of customers. That is going to happen at the end of this quarter, but it's not going to be a material contributor to Q4 growth. So it's really more a view of the pipeline that we have, like our lead pipeline for Q4, how strong we expect that business to be from what we have going now than any contribution from like a mere new product. Yes. So I think once we get to a steady state in terms of like having shoot up the excess capacity, and I think that happens in 2025. I think the kind of -- like I would expect that the floor in mobile is going to be closer to $1 billion than the $800 million that it is now. But up from that is really going to depend on whether AI-enabled smartphones are a thing or not, and whether AI-enabled smartphones deliver compelling customer value because that's a [indiscernible] in terms of the market. If a phone comes out that has -- that like has a much more complex processor, that's going to require more test time, which means that you need more testers to do it. And if it offers features that customers want badly enough, then that drives the refresh cycle down. And right now, like the average age of smartphones is older now than it's ever been, that people have been holding on to their phones much longer because there really hasn't been that compelling new feature that drives people to upgrade. So I really think that upside to like a $1 billion level in mobile is going to depend on whether the refresh rate in phones goes up and phone unit volume goes up. Yes. No, that is a remarkably blunt question, but it's fair. So -- and you're right in terms of the initial motivation that, the way the world looked to us in 2015 when we bought UR was that we were coming out of like a decade of shrinking TAMs in the semiconductor test market. And over that same decade, Paradigm also doubled our share in the semiconductor test market. So look, in that environment we managed to become more profitable. We've managed to essentially double our share position, but we didn't see that as a great long-term growth strategy. Like you can end up owning up a market that goes away. That's not particularly satisfying. So we were definitely on the hunt for a way to ensure the long-term growth of the enterprise. That was our original motivation. The thing that we have discovered since we bought these Robotics companies is that Paradigm essentially presents a unique value proposition in the advanced robotics space, that if you look at the people that can compete with us in the industrial automation world, the folks that are coming from industrial robots and industrial automation, the big players, they are typically not as comfortable in terms of delivering very high-tech products with very, very high tech -- very, very high reliability requirements. What we do with testers is honestly kind of astonishing. The level of reliability and the level of complexity is really kind of off the charts. And being able to bring that mindset and that skill set to our robotics businesses and also that reputation to our robotics businesses allows them to really compete well against the traditional IA folks that are pivoting into the advanced robotics space. And it gives us a killer advantage against the pure play advanced robotics folks because they're typically undersized, they are underscaled, they are spending beyond -- they are spending to a loss and they don't have international distribution or a spares logistics network. And so we kind of think that we are the right player to bring advanced robotics to an industrial scale. So the base that we have is, is there some point in the future where we -- where we may unlock shareholder value by having these two businesses be separate? Maybe. But right now, we think that like the Teradyne is like attaching Teradyne to the advanced robotics name is actually a significant differentiator and will allow us to lead in that space. So, I would consider it more to be cyclical. It is not and for sure we are always trying to get more market share, right. So, that is kind of a given. But the thing that we are seeing is that these VIP customers they are building extremely complex devices and they amount of applications and technical support require to help them get to market is significant and it is worth it. If you invest that money with that team then you end up with a part that drives a significant amount of business. So the ROI is there to make those investments, but those investments right now we are definitely in the phase where we are making more investments than we are reaping the results of them. So, I think it is a cyclical effect, long-term I would expect that we would be able to -- like I think we will grow revenue into the OPEX that we are taking on. Not reduce OPEX against normal revenue. So, that's sort of the view that we have that by treading in place of these VIP and networking spaces that we are going to be able to hold and grow without proportionally increasing OPEX the whole way. Okay, so on post stack dye cast that's a market that Paradigm was not able to participate in. And how we were qualified by major supplier in the middle of this year. And so we had significant [Technical Difficulty] stack dye performance test in the second half of this year from one of the major HBM suppliers. We are in core [ph] an additional HBM supplier and that is something that we would expect to drive some revenue in 2025 depending on the success of that particular supplier to get shared. Now when it comes to wafer store, that's really more aligned to sort of the traditional market share breakdown in the wafer storage space. So if you look at the -- this, there is a few important memory players. We have great DRAM wafer store share by one of the majors. We don't have much [indiscernible] share at the biggest. And we have -- we are doing well in the Memory manufacturers that are in China. So, as they grow we will do well as well. So, I think wafer store is probably the share space in -- is going to stay about the same but we are going to be gaining share. Yeah, it is an interesting take. The devices that are going to ramp next year is at the Test Chip phase now and we expect that there is modest complexity increases and a lot of that complexity increases is associated with AI. Modems is a different story. We don't see a trans towards additional modem integration. But we do see the opportunity for changes in supply chain [Technical Difficulty] begin to get modems from different sources than they get now. So, that is at play both in the iOS and the Android space. So, we don't see modem integration but we do see sort shifts in terms of who is providing the modems. I wish I could but I can't. So I can say that -- so we have the numbers and we use them internally and we don't feel that they are well enough audited to use them externally in this way. The only thing that I can tell you is that it's up a fair amount quarter-on-quarter, sort of mid- to high single digits range. But I don't really want to give absolute numbers because it's hard for us to do audit. And whether that continues in the fourth quarter, my expectation is that we will see significant continued increases in utilization in Q4, both because of normal seasonality and also because of the number of testers that we have upgrade kits to go from one market to another. Like someone is not going to upgrade a utilized tester to use it someplace else. They're going to upgrade an underutilized tester. So that's probably going to slide a bunch of testers from the unutilized column into the utilized column. So I think there's going to be additional improvement in utilization in Q4, but I can't give you a hard number."

Following Greg and Sanjay's comments this morning, we'll open up the call for questions. This call is scheduled for one hour. Greg?\nGreg Smith: Thank you, Traci. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, I will summarize our second quarter results and discuss the trends we are seeing in the semiconductor and Advanced Robotics industries. Then Sanjay will go into more depth about our second quarter results and forward looking guidance. At a high level the market dynamics that we identified in our April earnings call have continued through the second quarter. Cloud AI is driving strong demand across the SoC and memory test markets. We have accelerated engineering and sales investments to continue to improve our market position, drive share and increase our ability to deliver long-term sustainable growth. Outside of compute and memory, all other major test markets, including mobile, continue to be soft. Robotics has delivered on-plan results in a weak macro environment and we continue to expect incremental growth each quarter of this year. Focusing in on Q2, we delivered second quarter financial results above our revenue, gross margin and earnings guidance ranges. Memory and SoC delivered above our plan and showed strong performance in the quarter, primarily driven by AI applications. Continuing the trend we noted in the first quarter, Cloud AI demand drove compute revenue with considerable strength in networking devices. AI enabled data centers have a very high number of network connection points to support training large language models, which is changing the mix in this segment to include more networking silicon. Our historic strength in networking combined with shipments to support a vertically integrated producer or VIP resulted in compute revenue in the first half of 2024, exceeding all of our compute revenue in 2023. We currently expect that Teradyne's SoC revenue from the compute end market will be on par with mobile revenue this year. In memory AI driven HBM DRAM demand remains strong. We are now seeing AI driven servers pulling demand across a broader range of memory, including enterprise SSD NAND flash. We are also seeing memory demand for the mobile market with strength in LPDDR and continuing retooling to support the latest protocol based mobile flash memory technologies. As a result, our memory business has grown nearly 30% in the first half of 2024 compared to the first half of 2023. While we are not changing our estimated memory tam expectation for the year, we expect that the market is trending towards the upper end of our $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion forecast. Moving on to Q3, the positive impact of AI on test is expected to continue into the third quarter. However, a meaningful uptick in other end markets, including legacy auto and industrial, may not occur until the 2025 timeframe. As a result, at the company level for the full year, we continue to expect low single digit revenue growth from 2023. As a reminder, excluding the impact of the sale of DIS to Technoprobe, our 2024 revenue growth would have been a couple of percentage points higher. Now, turning to Robotics, despite a weak macro environment, our Advanced Robotics business grew sequentially from Q1 to Q2. Looking at the first half of 2024, we grew 11% compared to the first half of 2023. We estimate that traditional players in the automation space have seen sales actually decline in the range of 5% to 7% over the same period. We are executing a three-pronged growth strategy for our Advanced Robotics business; SAM expansion, channel transformation and recurring services and software. In the second quarter, we have made progress in all three areas.\nMiR1200 Pallet Jack: Our highest priority in our Robotics go-to-market transformation is the development of an OEM solutions channel for UR. We have seen that customers purchasing cobot-based solutions from these partners get into production more quickly and have fewer problems than customers that build their own solutions or rely upon an integration partner. There are two aspects to the OEM Channel strategy. The first is signing up new OEM solution partners. In the first half of 2024, we have increased the total number of OEM solutions partners by 8%. Second, we work with these partners to get them to scale, which we define as having an annual revenue run rate above $1 million. Midway through the year we have nearly as many OEM solution partners that have reached that revenue level as we had in all of 2023. One of our largest revenue OEM partners in the first half of 2024 uses our cobots in an AI based logistics solution. Overall, the OEM solutions channel has shown over 70% growth from the first half of 2023 to the first half of 2024. In the second quarter, the OEM channel represented over 30% of UR's revenue. Finally, because of the criticality of the processes that our Robotics are being used to automate, we saw an opportunity to build a strong service business. In the first half of 2024 we launched managed service offerings at UR and MiR and are beginning to see customer uptake. On balance, the positive effect of these growth vectors and the challenging demand environment, we are expecting growth towards the low end of this year's target 10% to 20% range. Last quarter, I shared the idea that AI would be a transformational, secular growth driver across Teradyne's businesses. In the first half of 2024, we saw the considerable AI driven growth in memory, networking and ramps of vertically integrated producers. But we think that this is just the beginning. We believe that a larger opportunity lies ahead as inference applications and edge AI begins to permeate the mobile and industrial end markets, markets where Teradyne is traditionally strong. We are also already seeing the impact of AI on our Robotics business, with AI powered OEM solutions for UR and a strong backlog for our AI enabled pallet jack. We believe that we are well positioned as a leading platform for the development of AI based solutions for manufacturing and logistics. We are seeing AI driven growth now and we expect AI to be an overarching growth driver for years to come in test and in Robotics. With that, I'll turn the call over to Sanjay. Sanjay?\nSanjay Mehta: Thank you, Greg. Good morning everyone. Today I'll cover the financial summary of Q2, provide our Q3 outlook and planning assumptions for the full year. Now to Q2. Second quarter sales were $730 million, which was $5 million above the high end of our guidance with non-GAAP EPS of $0.86, which was above our high end guide of $0.84. Non-GAAP gross margins were 58.3%. This was above our guidance due to higher volumes and product mix. Non-GAAP operating profit was approximately 22%. Turning to our revenue breakdown in Q2, Semi test revenue for the quarter was $543 million, with SoC contributing $414 million and memory $129 million. Strength in SOC was driven by both compute and mobile. Memory test shipments were driven by technology tooling for new UFS 4.0 standard in mobility. While the broader auto industry remained sluggish, we benefited from a VIP with a large purchase in this segment, reflecting edge AI's impact on the auto market. In memory, we continue to expect DRAM to dominate the memory mix. We have significant backlog for HVM, enabling strength in the memory market driven by AI. We closed the sale of our device interface solutions business or DIS to Technoprobe on May 27. DIS contributed $16 million to our revenue in the quarter consistent with our expectations in System test group Q2 revenue was $61 million with $17 million in storage tests on low SLT and HDD demand. Recall SLT has high exposure to the smartphone market and even as HDD end markets begin to recover, tester utilization remains low. In Wireless Test revenue was $36 million in Q2, improving as expected due to gaming and the initial ramp of Wi-Fi 7. Now to Robotics. For the fourth quarter in a row we executed to our revenue plan in Robotics. Revenue was $90 million, up sequentially and increased 26% year-over-year. In the quarter, UR contributed $75 million and MiR contributed $16 million. Given the potential changes in the regulatory environment involving China, we thought it would be helpful to provide some insight into our revenue exposure in that region. Year-to-date, approximately 10% of our total company sales were shipped to China. This includes shipments to indigenous and multinational customers. Total sales to indigenous customers was less than 5% in the first half of 2024. This is consistent with the full year of 2023. Our team continues to service our customers in this market while complying with all regulations. Shifting to some cash metrics. At a company level, our free cash flow was $171 million in the quarter. Strong free cash flow in the quarter was primarily driven by earnings and net working capital improvements. We repurchased $8 million of shares in the quarter and paid $19 million in dividends. We ended the quarter with $584 million in cash and marketable securities. The completion of the Technoprobe transactions resulted in a net cash outlay of $434 million and resulted in a 10% equity stake in Technoprobe. Some other financial information in Q2. We had two 10% customers in the quarter. The tax rate, excluding discrete items for the quarter, was 14.25% on a GAAP basis and 15% on a non-GAAP basis. Now to our outlook for Q3. Q3 sales are expected to be between $680 million and $740 million, with non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.66 to $0.86 on 164 million diluted shares. GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.62 to $0.82. Some color on our Q3 revenue expectation. In our April call, our mid-guide for Q2 was $695 million, and we noted that the third quarter would be flattish. Our second quarter revenue came in higher than we forecasted on the heels of strong demand in our Semi Test business. Our third quarter revenue forecast of $710 million at the midpoint is now higher than it was 90 days ago. Third quarter gross margins are estimated at 58.5% to 59.5% and OpEx is expected to run at 38% to 40% of third quarter sales, up from Q2. As Greg discussed, we are acting on opportunities to accelerate investments that we believe will drive share and long-term sustainable growth. The non-GAAP operating profit rate at the midpoint of our third quarter guidance is 20%. Our total semiconductor ATE TAM estimates remain unchanged from our view in April. However, we made some slight adjustments within the segments. We have included a slide in the appendix of our earnings deck with this information. Recall our SoC TAM range is $3.6 billion to $4.2 billion with a midpoint of $3.9 billion. This is comprised of compute, which we now estimate to be $1.6 billion, up $100 million from our prior estimate. The increase in compute is offset by a reduction in our estimate for mobile, which is down $100 million to $800 million. We estimate auto MCU at $500 million, industrial at $300 million, and services at $700 million each at the midpoint of our range. Our estimated memory TAM range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion appears to be tracking towards the high end. Back to revenues. With our outperformance in the first half of the year, our expectation for revenue distribution for the full year is now less back half weighted than our view in April. We currently expect around 48% of the company's revenue to be in the first half and 52% in the second half. We expect full year revenue to grow in the low single digit range compared to 2023. Note that excluding the impact of the DIS divestiture, our full year revenue growth expectation would be nearly 3 points higher. Now to gross margins. Gross margins have improved through the course of the year and are expected to be at our full target gross margin model by the fourth quarter. Full year gross margins will likely be in the 58% to 59% range, unchanged from our prior outlook. Regarding OpEx for the full year, we expect full year 2024 OpEx to grow approximately 8%, which is above our prior guidance of 5% to 7% as we accelerate investment and opportunities to continue to strengthen our position and gain share. Turning to Robotics profitability. As Greg noted, we expect to grow revenue towards the low end of our 10% to 20% range. We expect Robotics will be roughly breakeven in 2024. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate, excluding discrete items, are forecasted to be 14.25% and 15% respectively in 2024. With regard to capital allocation, we will continue to target our share buybacks in 2024 to an amount necessary to offset dilution from equity compensation and our employee share purchase program in order to build cash back up to $800 million. Summing up, we delivered sales and earnings above the high end of our guidance range as memory and compute revenue exceeded our plan in Semi Test. The mobile, industrial and legacy auto markets remained soft. Our Robotics team delivered sequential and year-over-year growth as we continue to execute our new product development and go-to-market strategies. Our company's first half performance gives us confidence that we are on track for the year. Our midterm fundamentals remain strong and we are investing to capture the opportunities beyond 2024. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator to open the line up for questions. Operator?\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from C.J. Muse of Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.\nC.J. Muse: Yes, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I was hoping maybe you could speak to visibility and outlook into 2025, particularly around Semi Test, and would love to hear your thoughts around how you're seeing recovery in mobility, as well as on the memory side progress with securing that second potential customer in HBM.\nGreg Smith: Hey CJ, this is Greg. Basically, we are pretty bullish on 2025. The Semi Test market in 2024, we're seeing strength in computing and we're also seeing fair amount of upgrade business where people are converting testers that were underutilized in mobile to use for compute and VIP applications, so that's soaking up some of the excess in that market. We expect that to really sort of accelerate business. As mobile returns in 2025, it won't have that capacity to grow into. On HBM, I think we continue to expect that we are going to make progress in two directions on HBM. One is that our share has primarily been in the pre-stack wafer test of HBM, and we believe that we're going to be gaining share in performance tests of the HBM memory after it's been stacked. And so we're hoping that we can expand both our market share within the account where we are participating in HBM and then also break into additional accounts for HBM and that would be more of a 2025 thing. So I think overall, our outlook for 2025 and into 2026 is in line with what we talked about in January.\nC.J. Muse: Excellent. And I guess as a followup, could you update us where you are with VIP? I think you talked about one large auto customer in June. Can you kind of size that for the industry for this year, how you see that growing next year and what additional kind of customers or end markets, whatever color you can give us in terms of how to think about the trajectory of that business into 2025?\nGreg Smith: Sure. So we, I think the way that we're looking at VIP is right now, because that growth has been happening at a time when there is a fair amount of capacity in OSATs to soak up. We're actually trying to keep track of the number of testers that are being used for these VIP customers. And right now it's hundreds of testers. There are currently hundreds of testers that are being used for VIP and we expect that to end. We have, I guess we should probably call it multiple VIP customers that are loading significant numbers of testers. We have additional VIPs where they've made plan of record decisions to put their parts on our testers and those parts are going to be released later in this year and into 2025. So we think that we'll probably exit this year with twice as many testers being used for these vertically integrated producers than we have right now.\nC.J. Muse: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tim Arcuri of UBS. Please go ahead.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. Sanjay, can you help us handicap the guidance for the DIS sale? I know you said it contributed $16 million in June. I mean, if I run rate that out, it's probably a $20 million to $25 million number that we should effectively sort of adjust to September guidance for. Is that correct on like a run rate basis?\nSanjay Mehta: Yes. If I go back to 2023, it was about $100 million business. And $20 million to $25 million is roughly the number. And this quarter, with the sale occurring kind of end of the second month on May 27, it was $16 million. So I think that estimate you have is reasonable. And as I noted my prepared remarks, we expect growth year-over-year to be in the low single digits, but without DIS, you'd expect it, or that's a shortfall of roughly 3 points. So you would increase that by 3 points if there was no DIS in 2023 and 2024 from a growth perspective.\nTimothy Arcuri: Okay, got it. And then, Greg, talking about next year, I mean, you guys have always talked about N2 being a big driver for the SoC TAM and I mean, we're seeing clear evidence that there's going to be a lot more N2. We're seeing upside pretty much everywhere for N2 wafer demand next year and the speed of the ramp. So I would think you're pretty optimistic about, I mean, sure, there's the mobility piece, but I would think you're pretty optimistic about next year because of N2. Can you speak specifically to the, you've kind of always talked about that as a big driver, and here it is. So can you talk about that?\nGreg Smith: Sure, yes. So we tend to think of the process nodes not as, from our Business perspective, not as a driver, but as an enabler. So the 2 nanometer or Gate-All-Around, they're going to be enablers for higher device complexity. But the thing that really drives our Business is whether the end market is pulling for that complexity. And we're really optimistic that between cloud AI and especially for edge AI like in mobile, that that is going to be a major driver for companies to get into N2 even at a faster rate than they got into N3. So we think that it's a good thing that the capacity is being put in place for N2 because we think that it's going to be needed. In addition, the deployment of edge AI, it's really going to increase complexity of the application processors. It's also going to be pulling harder on the mobile part of the memory market. So we think that there's sort of a virtuous circle in terms of the capacity being put in place, the end market demand that's going to use that capacity, and then the pull effect on other parts of the market enabled by the features that are going into these products. So we think basically this is going to be a good demand driver really through the rest of this midterm, 2025, 2026, 2027.\nTimothy Arcuri: Got it. Okay, thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini of SIG. Please go ahead.\nMehdi Hosseini: Yes, thanks for taking my question. I want to followup on your commentary that mobile SoC revenue in 2024 will be comparable to compute. I understand the diversification of customers and additional data center. But your assumption also is impacted by a weak mobile market. So, assuming that N2 and smartphone refresh in 2025 would help you with the mobile SoC. Should we also assume that the compute would also grow at the same rate? In other words, this equilibrium, would it sustain into next year?\nGreg Smith: So that's a good question, Mehdi, because there's a little bit of subtlety to this. So you're right that one of the reasons that our mobile revenue and our compute revenue are going to be comparable in 2024 is because the mobile market is weak. But the other reason is, and I talked about this in my prepared remarks, that our compute revenue for the first half is bigger than all of our compute revenue for 2023 and we see good strength for compute in the second half of this year as well. So, like, things are going great in compute. Next year, we think that compute is going to remain strong, but the TAM sizes for compute are likely to be in the same range, maybe a little bit stronger than where they were. The mobile market really should come back pretty strongly, and so our mobile revenue will come back with that. So we anticipate that we'll have good revenue growth in compute, but it's very possible that mobile will outweigh it next year because of the strength of that recovery.\nMehdi Hosseini: Okay, thank you and then one followup for Sanjay. If Robotics business is going to be breakeven in 2024, then profitable next year, is the underlying assumption baked into your 2026 target or could there be an acceleration of profitability? I just want to see how the breakeven in 2024 for Robotics fit into your 2026 target. Thank you.\nSanjay Mehta: Sure. So, in 2024, we started the year with thinking that we'd be just a little bit above breakeven, low single digits. As we look to the year, and we see the range of 10% to 20% this year of growth, and we see that coming in more to the lower end of the range, we think that number is about breakeven. And in our earnings model, we had 20% to 30% growth. So with that incremental scale, we did build in a level of profitability in the outer years, and we still believe that that trajectory is going to occur as we move into the future.\nMehdi Hosseini: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Vivek Arya of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Greg, for next year, as you suggested, the turnaround in mobile seems to be kind of the biggest catalyst for Teradyne. So when we look at the TAM of about $800 million for this year, could you help us give some range for what recovery looks like? Are we talking 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%? Just can you help us have some broad range? And how much of this you think comes from mobile industry with faster unit growth? How much of this comes from more testing complexity? And then a kind of a small nuance question there is, your large customer could also have a change in their modem suppliers for at least some SKUs. Is that net positive, negative, neutral to your business?\nGreg Smith: So let me take the second part of your question first, and then, actually, I'm going to tag team the first part with Sanjay because I want to work on sort of a history lesson perspective of the mobile TAM to try and bracket what we would see in 2025. But in terms of the modem supplier, for the our historically largest customer, a thing to remember is that whoever is supplying that modem is also likely supplying all of the ancillary devices associated with that modem. So there's a modem, there's power management, there's RF, and if that was to change, there's a lot of pluses and minuses. The thing that I will tell you is that they're all relatively small relative to the magnitude of the overall AP business. So if that was to change, I would expect it to be a slight positive for us, but I don't think it's a game changer kind of a thing. And so, on the mobile TAM, so Sanjay, could you just give us sort of the history of the mobile TAM, like over the past few years?\nSanjay Mehta: Sure. So, this year at the midpoint, as we've noted, $800 million, and last year we noted approximately $900 million, and in 2022, it was roughly $1.6 billion. It peaked our view in 2021 at approximately $2 billion.\nGreg Smith: Okay, so take what I'm going to say with a grain of salt, because we are entering into our strategic planning process and haven't completed sort of an updated view of 2025. But the thing that I will tell you is that the mobile TAMs are unlikely to go as high as we saw during the COVID peak, but they're likely to be significantly stronger than what we're seeing in 2023 and 2024. So going in the middle of that range might not be a bad idea, but it's a pretty big range. Vivek, does that help at all?\nVivek Arya: Yes, extremely helpful. Thank you so much. And for my followup question on the Robotics business, you've taken the growth rate this year towards the lower end of the 10% to 20%. I think you mentioned some macro factors. If I look at, again a historical view, that segment continues to disappoint every year in terms of its growth rate. It's not really profitable. So I'm curious, at what point do you think it actually realizes the promise and anticipation? Is it a matter of scale? Is it a matter of channel? What will it take for it to actually achieve the growth rate that you anticipate for that business?\nGreg Smith: That's a great question. So I think you are -- in terms of your hypothesis, you're hitting the nail on the head, that part of it is scale, part of it is channel. The thing that we are really -- we're actually really optimistic about our Robotics business right now, that the macro environment is really weak. Our automation peers are struggling with declining sales. We posted an 11% gain over the first half. And the thing that is encouraging to us is that that 11% gain is on the back of specific aspects of the strategy that we're executing. We were trying to expand our SAM [ph] by adding a high payload, high payload options for universal robots. And those robots are accounting for 20% of our sales in the quarter. We are trying to build additional channels, and our OEM channel grew by 70% year-on-year for the first half. We have additional irons in the fire to drive additional growth that have not yet paid off. And there are primarily other aspects of market expansion. So our Pallet Jack for the AMR business, additional products that are coming to market for UR as well. We have additional channels that we are building. We've been working for the last year and a half on building out a large accounts channel and we have significant pipeline for that, but we don't have significant revenue growth to see from it yet. And then finally, we think that there's a very significant revenue opportunity in service and recurring software. Right now, that's a vanishingly small part of our revenue in Robotics. But every business that has machinery in critical processes definitely needs to have a way to keep that stuff running. And we have an example in our semiconductor business, where service represents a significant portion of our overall revenue and we are trying to apply that same model of managed service plans in Robotics. And we're actually seeing good customer uptake, but not a lot of revenue yet. So we think that those three engines are going to be kicking in, in 2025, on top of growth that we're going to still get from the things that we've done in 2023 and 2024. So we're pretty optimistic that the end market is terrible, but we're actually doing what we said we were going to do in terms of the strategy.\nVivek Arya: Okay.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Krish Sankar - TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nKrish Sankar: Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. Greg, just first on clarification, you maintain your full year revenue guide of low single digits, but I remember compared to last quarter, you kind of increased the test revenue up modestly. So I'm just kind of curious, is this just a little bit of nuance that is within the margin of error or anything else happening over there?\nSanjay Mehta: Hi Chris, it's Sanjay. At a top level, you're right, we did guide the full year consistently with the first half a little bit stronger than we anticipated. And what's happening under the covers is Semi Test is up, but our other test businesses are down a little bit in the way of in storage it's tied to the global market and SLT and the HDD. As that market returns, there is still underutilized capacity. In our Defense and Aerospace business, we had some projects push out and our production board business we had, it's tied to the automotive slowdown. And so overall Semi Test is stronger and the other test is lower. And then we did move to the lower end of our Robotics range. So at a top level we're calling the same year, but Semi Test stronger, other tests a little weaker, and Robotics is at the low end of the range.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Very helpful, Sanjay. And then just a quick followup. You kind of mentioned strength in networking test. If you look at some of the GPU providers, clearly where [indiscernible] has a very strong position. Do you think this networking test opportunity can manifest itself into some share gains on the GPU side or you think that AI opportunity is more to the VIPs, not to the Semi device makers?\nGreg Smith: I'm really, really glad you asked that question. So there are a couple of things going on in the compute space around this topic of cloud AI and building large capabilities to do training of large language models. So the first is obviously huge demand for GPU's. That's why people have seen Nvidia run up as much. They are providing an incredibly valuable engine for all of this. But if you look at an AI enabled server, there is a much larger number of high speed data links within a server rack than there is for a traditional server. And so in more traditional accelerated computing, we were seeing a ratio of, within a specific account, it might be 90% GPUs, 10% networking, that's trending more towards 20% or even higher. So there's definitely a tailwind there that is beneficial. The other is, as these models become more sophisticated and the players in this space are trying to differentiate between these large language models, they're each trying to gain an advantage through architecture and that's driving this VIP design trend that we're seeing. So we think that there's enough end market demand to drive growth for both sort of traditional GPU based AI models and also drive even faster growth for the VIP or homegrown silicon that is being built into these large server firms.\nKrish Sankar: Got it. Thank you, Greg, very helpful.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nToshiya Hari: Hi, good morning. Thank you so much. Greg, you talked about strength in compute soaking up some of the idle capacity across the mobile space. I'm curious where test utilization rates are in mobile, across OSATs and your IDM customers, to the extent you've got some visibility. And then for auto and industrial as well, where are utilization rates generally today? And when you talk about a recovery in 2025, I know it's hard to predict, but at what point do you think utilization rates get to a point where customers resume purchases of testers?\nGreg Smith: So, to answer the last part of your question first, I think we're very close to the point where the balance is going to tip back away from soaking up capacity to driving new system sales. The trends that we're seeing, third party data around test utilization are showing a good uptick, a little bit above sort of typical seasonality. Our own data is showing mixed utilization right now. We don't see a clear trend there, but we do have a fair amount of both systems that have already been converted and also upgrades that would be used as conversion kits. And so that is going to essentially occupy hundreds of testers that are underutilized now. So we are expecting utilization to tick up pretty strongly in the second half of this year, and for that to tip over to the point where it turns into real system demand. When you get to the IDM customers, especially in auto and industrial, there's an interesting, many of those customers are down significantly year-over-year from 2023 to 2024, but a lot of them are persisting in relatively aggressive capacity expansion plants. They see the same thing that we've been talking about in the automotive space, that there are going to be short-term fluctuations, but the crossover to EVs and hybrids is something that it's a question of like when, not if, that is going to happen and the amount of compute power in cars and other electronics in cars is going to continue to increase the attach rate of more chips per car shipped. So they have long-term plans to drive capacity and they have long-term plans for purchasing our equipment that we think is going to be important. So we are cautious about the current downturn that we're seeing in automotive, but we're really confident about the long-term potential in that space, especially parts of it where we have a ton of good share and great customer relationships like battery management, discrete in power and more and more importantly ADAS stuff. So right now I think the utilization in auto and industrial is down, but what the signals that we're hearing from those customers is that they expect that to be relatively short lived.\nToshiya Hari: Got it. That's really helpful. Thank you. And as a followup on the robotics side, your point about AI helping your UR business and the MiR business makes intuitive sense to me. I just have a hard time sort of thinking about the timing and sort of the magnitude of that kicking in. You mentioned backlog for your new MiR product being pretty significant into Q4. Maybe we start to see benefits there, but on the UR side, what kind of applications should we be looking out for as it pertains to AI helping that business? And again, at what point does sort of the contribution of AI start to really show up in numbers? Thank you.\nGreg Smith: Okay, so there's a lot to unpack there, so let's get down to it. So the story for MiR is pretty simple, that take a robot, add AI capability, and suddenly you have a robot that works better. That's our basic hypothesis behind the pallet jack, is that we're going to be able to have a higher success rate picking pallets than competing solutions. And so far, the customer reception is that they think that those claims have some merit. So we have a pretty strong backlog for a product that we're going to start shipping in Q4 of this year. So that's pretty simple. For UR, the story is a lot more complex because what we're really doing is creating a platform for our solution providers to build AI based solutions on. And there's actually like four chunks of an AI based solution on UR. At the bottom, you have our robot and the software that controls our robot. And then on top of that, there's AI toolkits that can come from Nvidia or can come from other providers that really give the primitives that allow people to use AI capabilities to solve problems. Then on top of that, there's usually a solution builder. And so what that solution builder will do is they'll take our robot and that toolkit and they will build a solution to do something like heterogeneous bin picking or vision based inspection or welding, and then they will take that solution and they will market it to their end customers. So the key thing that differentiates the UR platform from other robots is its features as a platform. So the APIs that people can use, the features that they need in order to build these solutions for, and that's what makes us sticky, is that once a solution provider builds a solution around a specific toolkit in our robot, it's tough for them to move off. The thing about that model for UR is that it's a slower burnt. That it's an indirect AI drives our business indirectly because we're not building the AI solution, our solution providers are. So I'll tell you that we have AI based solutions in the market. Right now, our estimate is that high single digits of UR sales are going into AI based applications that are in the market right now. So that's sort of our baseline and we intend to grow from there. These solution providers, it can take a while from when they begin building their solution to when they see a commercial inflection and that's often in excess of a year. So we have a great pipeline of partners that are using AI right now to try and build solutions and we would expect that to deliver material revenue in 2025, but not in 2024. So sorry for going deep, but you kind of hit a nerve.\nToshiya Hari: Thank you for all the details.\nOperator: The next question comes from Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJoseph Moore: Great, thank you. I wonder if you could talk about the HBM test in particular. I'm just curious, as we move from HBM3 to HBM3E and then later to HBM4, can you talk about how much S3 use there's going to be versus upgrade requirements?\nGreg Smith: Okay. So on HBM, the primary difference from a test perspective, as you go from HBM3 to HBM3E to HBM4, is the data rates that are required in the performance test of the final HBM product and the capacity that's in place right now for HBM3, most of it, essentially all of it, is incapable of testing at the data rates required for HBM3E and HBM4. So the people that are building HBM3E are seeking additional capacity. They're essentially retooling to be able to test the HBM3E. Now, this is one of the areas where we believe we have an advantage that will allow us to gain share in HBM performance test, that we have a tester that is going to be effective for both HBM3E and HBM4. And so that essentially will give customers that adopt that solution longer asset life than if they were to adopt a competing solution. So we are pretty hopeful about our opportunity to gain share in HBM performance test and we're working on essentially benchmark competitions in multiple customers to try to prove that.\nJoseph Moore: Great, thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Samik Chatterjee of JPMorgan Chase & Co. Please go ahead.\nSamik Chatterjee: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. I guess for the first one Greg, if I can go back to one of the comments that you made about the compute time for next year when you were comparing compute versus mobility and your expectations for next year. I'm just wondering, you said compute to be robust, but remain at these strong levels. We've seen the compute TAM go from, I think, 1.2 to 1.6 this year. Are you implying that we sort of 1.4 to 1.6? I'm sorry and are you implying you sort of hold around this 1.6 level or a similar increase that you're seeing this year. And what should we think about what's incorporated in that for the portion of the market that's sort of associated with the VIPs and growth outlook for them in 2025 in that number?\nGreg Smith: So I think it'd probably be a good idea to do our TAM history lesson in compute as well, so really strong this year. Why don't we go back a couple of years and set that as context, and then we'll bracket kind of what we think we'll do in 2025. So, Sanjay, could you do that?\nSanjay Mehta: Sure. So let me give some more context. So 2019, the compute TAM, our view was about $600 million. Fast forward, we went to nearly double that in 2021, between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion. And then in 2022, it went to $1.3 billion and as you noted, 2023 at approximately $1.4 billion and this year at the midpoint, our view is $1.6 billion.\nGreg Smith: So as you look into 2025, we don't think that we would see mammoth increases to the compute TAM. It is between 2x and 3x larger than it was in 2019 at this point in time. And for sure, people are trying to add capacity all through the production chain, but it's coming off of a really high base. So looking forward into next year, I would probably be looking at where we are this year, plus or minus something, versus a much -- a lot of increase in the compute space. Now, you asked about VIPs. Right now, VIPs are towards the low end of a $100 million to $200 million range. It could trend towards the high end of that by the end of this year. We think that by the time we get out to 2026, VIPs will be about $500 million of the overall compute spend. So I think that's a pretty exciting chunk. That could be a quarter to a third of the compute TAM could be driven by VIPs.\nSamik Chatterjee: Got it. And for my followup, I know you're reiterating your 2026 plan today, which still sort of implies a 20%, 25% CAGR for the next couple of years. I'm just trying to compare that with the exit run rate this year that you have in terms of growth. Even when I add back Technoprobe and the impact of that, it sort of is in that sort of 10% to 15% range. Can you help me just think about how to think about the impact that the underutilization and mobility is having on your revenue, just to think whether, how do you bridge the gap from this 10% to 15% in the back half to maintaining a 20%, 25% CAGR for the next couple of years?\nGreg Smith: So I guess the best thing to say is that at the point in time, there are two things that are going on since we set our plan. One is that the amount of underutilized capacity was larger than we thought at the point that we built our plan. The other thing that's happened since we built our plan is that even in 2024, compute has strengthened by a couple $100 million that the sort of the underlying demand drivers in the market are stronger than we were forecasting. So when you balance the deeper hole of utilization and the stronger end market demand then I think our hypothesis for 2026 holds.\nSanjay Mehta: Maybe I'll just add a little bit. When we take a look at our model, as Greg noted earlier, mobility comes back. But let me remind also what he said. It doesn't come back to the peak levels, comes back to kind of a regular level, but mobility comes back. The trends in automotive, with more silicon going in, combustible engines, the conversion to EV and battery management systems is another tailwind and industrial comes back coupled with the compute. And I'll remind you that our Robotics business had a 20% to 30% growth in there as well. So that's kind of how you get there.\nSamik Chatterjee: Yep. Thank you. Thanks for taking the questions.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brian Chin of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nBrian Chin: Hi there. Good morning. Thanks for letting us ask a few quick questions. Greg, may be just curious, in Q2, in compute and memory, which obviously drove a lot of that sequential strength, was there any shipment pull in from second half or 3Q?\nGreg Smith: I'll actually let Sanjay answer that one.\nSanjay Mehta: Yes, Brian, we did see acceleration from Q3 into Q2. Customers were pulling. And that's in my view we have a full year view and Semi Test is a little bit stronger, as I noted earlier. Customers are pulling and the demand is there. And we see a fairly strong backlog going into Q3 with kind of low turns. So we're in a, I think from a compute and memory perspective, yes we did see some acceleration.\nBrian Chin: Okay, great. That's helpful color. And then may be just thinking about the service and software opportunity in Robotics is small today. But just curious, can you sort of size up the active installed base of UR and mobile robots in the field and what their typical useful life is? And how big could service and software be as a percent of revenue by 2026?\nSanjay Mehta: Yes, so, rough numbers here, but we have on the order of 80,000 UR cobots out in the field, and probably on the order of 10,000 or more AMRs. The useful life of them is, we have cobots that were delivered before Teradyne bought Universal Robots that are still being used, but most of our customers will depreciate the asset over about a five-year period. So, I think if you're trying to model sort of installed base decay, it's not a bad idea to look at maybe a five to seven-year life. So, I think, and you're going at this exactly the same way that we're thinking about, that we look at the entire installed base, not just new equipment sales as our total available market service agreements. And we're also doing this service agreement build in alignment with the build out of our large account channel. So large accounts are the ones that are most likely to have large fleets and are most likely to see advantage from a managed service plan and that's another sort of aspect to the strategy that we're building out.\nBrian Chin: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Atif Malik of Citi. Please go ahead.\nAtif Malik: Hi. Thank you for taking my questions and thank you for providing the history lesson on the TAM on Slide 13. A quick one, the mobility weakness, fair to assume that is on the Android side?\nGreg Smith: The mobility weakness is really both Android and iOS. If you look across the major suppliers for silicon for all of those ecosystems, it's generally pretty weak. Now, if you peel it back a little bit under the covers, there are some areas of the mobile space that have done better during this downturn than others. So one aspect of it is in image sensor, that the transition to, like 48 megapixel image sensors really put some pressure on the suppliers in that space, and they've added capacity both in iOS and Android land. The other is the improvements in wireless charging and other charging aspects that even now, when we've seen significant weakness in power and linear, we're still seeing some incremental demand as people always want their phones to charge faster. They want them to charge faster on wireless charging. So, we're seeing increased silicon content there. So it's been a little bit of a bright spot within that market. So, I think we've seen broad-based weakness in 2023 and continuing into 2024, and we expect to see relatively broad-based recovery in 2025.\nAtif Malik: Great. As my followup for Sanjay, you've talked about full year gross margins 58% to 59%. And if you were to assume that the mobility and compute becomes larger at your large customer next year, all else being equal, like auto, industrial, how will that impact the gross margin profile for next year?\nSanjay Mehta: Yes, so we're happy with this year's gross margin performance kind of playing out as we expected. A little bit better though, in the first half, but 58% to 59% with continuous improvement. And I would say that, regarding next year, obviously, we'll provide a little bit more color in January. But the way I'd think about it is, we do expect revenues to grow, so we'll have a bit of a tailwind tied to volume. And it really depends in those segments you referred to as what specifically the customer is ordering. It depends on the configurations of the instruments. And so, I think, in my view, I think that we're exiting the year at our model. That's what we expect and look forward to giving you more of an update in January for 2025. But I would leave you with a higher volume level, it should help as tailwind.\nAtif Malik: Good enough. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Barger of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nSteve Barger: Hey, good morning. Thanks for stretching the call. Greg, you talked about all the growth opportunities for both test and robotics for 2025 and 2026, and I wanted to tie that back to the accelerated OpEx investments. Is that increased spend supporting everything we've talked about today or there are also new products you're planning on that add to the existing lineup?\nGreg Smith: So, I will tell you that our OpEx acceleration is in both R&D and in our sales and marketing expenses. So you can infer from that that means that we're working on new products and we're working on building relationships with new customers and trying to capture. The key thing in semiconductors is that once customers make a platform decision, then it becomes very, very difficult to change their direction. And so we see a fleeting opportunity with all of the new VIPs to get in the door and influence that initial platform decision. So we're going to take those opportunities and we're going to make the investments to try to capture them while that share is available versus trying to move it after the cement sets. The one thing I will say is that the focus of our acceleration is really in our test business that we see that we have. We're confident in our strategy in Robotics, and we're confident for the OpEx plan that we put together. We saw no need to pour on more OpEx in our Robotics business. We're going to execute the plan that we set. But in the test business, especially in our semiconductor test business and in the system level test business, we saw an opportunity by accelerating our spend that we would be able to drive a better outcome long-term. So that's where that money's going.\nSteve Barger: Understood. And just one last one. You said there's good customer uptake in industrials for services, but not a lot of revenue yet. Is that because the new customers are not taking all of what you offer or why is revenue not tracking uptake?\nGreg Smith: So it is mainly because the rollout of those programs. We're trying to make sure that we can walk before we run when it comes to these service programs. So we have essentially piloted the programs in a relatively small region and we're seeing good results in that region, but we have not deployed the program worldwide because we have to build out the infrastructure to support it. So that's why I say that we haven't seen material uptake is just because it isn't globally deployed at this point.\nSteve Barger: Does that happen in the back half of this year or more 2025 a global rollout?\nGreg Smith: Oh, definitely 2025. So in the back half of this year, we're going to be -- and also the sales cycle time for the service business is it's not terribly long, but it's probably a couple of quarters because you have to establish the value for the managed service plan. So we have a lot of interest. We are talking to a lot of customers, but we haven't closed the deals yet, because I think some of it is that it needs to be incorporated into their 2025 budgets. So, I'm very hopeful that we'll see an inflection in service revenue in 2025. I don't think we'll see much in terms of revenue in 2024.\nSteve Barger: Understood, thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Gus Richard of Northland Capital. Please come ahead.\nGus Richard: Yes, thanks for taking the question. I'm just curious, in terms of the jump balls with the vertically integrated producers, where's your win rate? How much of that business do you guys think you're picking up?\nGreg Smith: So our win rate on sockets, when we started describing our plans in VIPs, we said that we were trying to make sure that we got at least sort of an even split of sockets. And right now in 2024, that's kind of how it's playing out, that we're getting our fair share of wins. The other way that we're looking at this is in terms of testers loaded. So we're not looking at it in terms of tester purchases because of the underutilization, but we are trying to count noses in terms of how many testers are being loaded by our customers versus testers being loaded by our competition's customers. And right now I would say that we are kind of 60/40 in favor of Teradyne in terms of testers loaded for VIP customers.\nGus Richard: Got it. That's helpful. And then the follow on is, thinking about your investment in Technoprobe, how is that helping your effort to expand your market share in these jump balls?\nGreg Smith: So right now it's not having a significant effect. The key thing that we are trying to do in the joint development projects that we have with Technoprobe is to take on relatively hard problems that required collaboration between us and Technoprobe that unless we had a firm partnership, we'd be unwilling to take that risk on speculation. We have initiated those projects, but they do require technology development on both sides. So right now, what we said at the point in time when we announced the deal is that we thought this would have a low-single-digit, long-term effect on market share in the Semi Test space. We still think that that's true and we think that we're on track to achieve those gains.\nGus Richard: Yes. And just to be clear, are these the VIPs or the existing wins and losses that have already happened? Do you think it can increase your penetration in areas where decisions have already been made?\nGreg Smith: So we haven't publicly announced sort of what segments of the market we are doing these joint development projects, because we think that we need to keep that relatively proprietary until we have demonstrated the success. But I will say that the key things that we believe are enabled by the projects that we're working on with Technoprobe are around devices that have very high power requirements and also devices that have very high parallelism. So the TPI probe technology is unlocking sort of the high end scalability of our test platforms in both SoC and memory. And we think that that's going to result in share gain by sort of opening up a place where both TPI and Teradyne are differentiated from their competition.\nGus Richard: Got it. Thank you, very helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I will now hand over to Traci Tsuchiguchi for closing remarks. Thank you.\nTraci Tsuchiguchi: Thank you all for joining us this morning. We look forward to seeing many of you through the course of the quarter and until then, have a great morning. Bye.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's event. Thank you for attending and you may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Sanjay Mehta",
            "content": "Thank you, Greg. Good morning everyone. Today I'll cover the financial summary of Q2, provide our Q3 outlook and planning assumptions for the full year. Now to Q2. Second quarter sales were $730 million, which was $5 million above the high end of our guidance with non-GAAP EPS of $0.86, which was above our high end guide of $0.84. Non-GAAP gross margins were 58.3%. This was above our guidance due to higher volumes and product mix. Non-GAAP operating profit was approximately 22%. Turning to our revenue breakdown in Q2, Semi test revenue for the quarter was $543 million, with SoC contributing $414 million and memory $129 million. Strength in SOC was driven by both compute and mobile. Memory test shipments were driven by technology tooling for new UFS 4.0 standard in mobility. While the broader auto industry remained sluggish, we benefited from a VIP with a large purchase in this segment, reflecting edge AI's impact on the auto market. In memory, we continue to expect DRAM to dominate the memory mix. We have significant backlog for HVM, enabling strength in the memory market driven by AI. We closed the sale of our device interface solutions business or DIS to Technoprobe on May 27. DIS contributed $16 million to our revenue in the quarter consistent with our expectations in System test group Q2 revenue was $61 million with $17 million in storage tests on low SLT and HDD demand. Recall SLT has high exposure to the smartphone market and even as HDD end markets begin to recover, tester utilization remains low. In Wireless Test revenue was $36 million in Q2, improving as expected due to gaming and the initial ramp of Wi-Fi 7. Now to Robotics. For the fourth quarter in a row we executed to our revenue plan in Robotics. Revenue was $90 million, up sequentially and increased 26% year-over-year. In the quarter, UR contributed $75 million and MiR contributed $16 million. Given the potential changes in the regulatory environment involving China, we thought it would be helpful to provide some insight into our revenue exposure in that region. Year-to-date, approximately 10% of our total company sales were shipped to China. This includes shipments to indigenous and multinational customers. Total sales to indigenous customers was less than 5% in the first half of 2024. This is consistent with the full year of 2023. Our team continues to service our customers in this market while complying with all regulations. Shifting to some cash metrics. At a company level, our free cash flow was $171 million in the quarter. Strong free cash flow in the quarter was primarily driven by earnings and net working capital improvements. We repurchased $8 million of shares in the quarter and paid $19 million in dividends. We ended the quarter with $584 million in cash and marketable securities. The completion of the Technoprobe transactions resulted in a net cash outlay of $434 million and resulted in a 10% equity stake in Technoprobe. Some other financial information in Q2. We had two 10% customers in the quarter. The tax rate, excluding discrete items for the quarter, was 14.25% on a GAAP basis and 15% on a non-GAAP basis. Now to our outlook for Q3. Q3 sales are expected to be between $680 million and $740 million, with non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.66 to $0.86 on 164 million diluted shares. GAAP EPS is expected to be in the range of $0.62 to $0.82. Some color on our Q3 revenue expectation. In our April call, our mid-guide for Q2 was $695 million, and we noted that the third quarter would be flattish. Our second quarter revenue came in higher than we forecasted on the heels of strong demand in our Semi Test business. Our third quarter revenue forecast of $710 million at the midpoint is now higher than it was 90 days ago. Third quarter gross margins are estimated at 58.5% to 59.5% and OpEx is expected to run at 38% to 40% of third quarter sales, up from Q2. As Greg discussed, we are acting on opportunities to accelerate investments that we believe will drive share and long-term sustainable growth. The non-GAAP operating profit rate at the midpoint of our third quarter guidance is 20%. Our total semiconductor ATE TAM estimates remain unchanged from our view in April. However, we made some slight adjustments within the segments. We have included a slide in the appendix of our earnings deck with this information. Recall our SoC TAM range is $3.6 billion to $4.2 billion with a midpoint of $3.9 billion. This is comprised of compute, which we now estimate to be $1.6 billion, up $100 million from our prior estimate. The increase in compute is offset by a reduction in our estimate for mobile, which is down $100 million to $800 million. We estimate auto MCU at $500 million, industrial at $300 million, and services at $700 million each at the midpoint of our range. Our estimated memory TAM range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion appears to be tracking towards the high end. Back to revenues. With our outperformance in the first half of the year, our expectation for revenue distribution for the full year is now less back half weighted than our view in April. We currently expect around 48% of the company's revenue to be in the first half and 52% in the second half. We expect full year revenue to grow in the low single digit range compared to 2023. Note that excluding the impact of the DIS divestiture, our full year revenue growth expectation would be nearly 3 points higher. Now to gross margins. Gross margins have improved through the course of the year and are expected to be at our full target gross margin model by the fourth quarter. Full year gross margins will likely be in the 58% to 59% range, unchanged from our prior outlook. Regarding OpEx for the full year, we expect full year 2024 OpEx to grow approximately 8%, which is above our prior guidance of 5% to 7% as we accelerate investment and opportunities to continue to strengthen our position and gain share. Turning to Robotics profitability. As Greg noted, we expect to grow revenue towards the low end of our 10% to 20% range. We expect Robotics will be roughly breakeven in 2024. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate, excluding discrete items, are forecasted to be 14.25% and 15% respectively in 2024. With regard to capital allocation, we will continue to target our share buybacks in 2024 to an amount necessary to offset dilution from equity compensation and our employee share purchase program in order to build cash back up to $800 million. Summing up, we delivered sales and earnings above the high end of our guidance range as memory and compute revenue exceeded our plan in Semi Test. The mobile, industrial and legacy auto markets remained soft. Our Robotics team delivered sequential and year-over-year growth as we continue to execute our new product development and go-to-market strategies. Our company's first half performance gives us confidence that we are on track for the year. Our midterm fundamentals remain strong and we are investing to capture the opportunities beyond 2024. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator to open the line up for questions. Operator? Yes. If I go back to 2023, it was about $100 million business. And $20 million to $25 million is roughly the number. And this quarter, with the sale occurring kind of end of the second month on May 27, it was $16 million. So I think that estimate you have is reasonable. And as I noted my prepared remarks, we expect growth year-over-year to be in the low single digits, but without DIS, you'd expect it, or that's a shortfall of roughly 3 points. So you would increase that by 3 points if there was no DIS in 2023 and 2024 from a growth perspective. Sure. So, in 2024, we started the year with thinking that we'd be just a little bit above breakeven, low single digits. As we look to the year, and we see the range of 10% to 20% this year of growth, and we see that coming in more to the lower end of the range, we think that number is about breakeven. And in our earnings model, we had 20% to 30% growth. So with that incremental scale, we did build in a level of profitability in the outer years, and we still believe that that trajectory is going to occur as we move into the future. Sure. So, this year at the midpoint, as we've noted, $800 million, and last year we noted approximately $900 million, and in 2022, it was roughly $1.6 billion. It peaked our view in 2021 at approximately $2 billion. Hi Chris, it's Sanjay. At a top level, you're right, we did guide the full year consistently with the first half a little bit stronger than we anticipated. And what's happening under the covers is Semi Test is up, but our other test businesses are down a little bit in the way of in storage it's tied to the global market and SLT and the HDD. As that market returns, there is still underutilized capacity. In our Defense and Aerospace business, we had some projects push out and our production board business we had, it's tied to the automotive slowdown. And so overall Semi Test is stronger and the other test is lower. And then we did move to the lower end of our Robotics range. So at a top level we're calling the same year, but Semi Test stronger, other tests a little weaker, and Robotics is at the low end of the range. Sure. So let me give some more context. So 2019, the compute TAM, our view was about $600 million. Fast forward, we went to nearly double that in 2021, between $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion. And then in 2022, it went to $1.3 billion and as you noted, 2023 at approximately $1.4 billion and this year at the midpoint, our view is $1.6 billion. Maybe I'll just add a little bit. When we take a look at our model, as Greg noted earlier, mobility comes back. But let me remind also what he said. It doesn't come back to the peak levels, comes back to kind of a regular level, but mobility comes back. The trends in automotive, with more silicon going in, combustible engines, the conversion to EV and battery management systems is another tailwind and industrial comes back coupled with the compute. And I'll remind you that our Robotics business had a 20% to 30% growth in there as well. So that's kind of how you get there. Yes, Brian, we did see acceleration from Q3 into Q2. Customers were pulling. And that's in my view we have a full year view and Semi Test is a little bit stronger, as I noted earlier. Customers are pulling and the demand is there. And we see a fairly strong backlog going into Q3 with kind of low turns. So we're in a, I think from a compute and memory perspective, yes we did see some acceleration. Yes, so, rough numbers here, but we have on the order of 80,000 UR cobots out in the field, and probably on the order of 10,000 or more AMRs. The useful life of them is, we have cobots that were delivered before Teradyne bought Universal Robots that are still being used, but most of our customers will depreciate the asset over about a five-year period. So, I think if you're trying to model sort of installed base decay, it's not a bad idea to look at maybe a five to seven-year life. So, I think, and you're going at this exactly the same way that we're thinking about, that we look at the entire installed base, not just new equipment sales as our total available market service agreements. And we're also doing this service agreement build in alignment with the build out of our large account channel. So large accounts are the ones that are most likely to have large fleets and are most likely to see advantage from a managed service plan and that's another sort of aspect to the strategy that we're building out. Yes, so we're happy with this year's gross margin performance kind of playing out as we expected. A little bit better though, in the first half, but 58% to 59% with continuous improvement. And I would say that, regarding next year, obviously, we'll provide a little bit more color in January. But the way I'd think about it is, we do expect revenues to grow, so we'll have a bit of a tailwind tied to volume. And it really depends in those segments you referred to as what specifically the customer is ordering. It depends on the configurations of the instruments. And so, I think, in my view, I think that we're exiting the year at our model. That's what we expect and look forward to giving you more of an update in January for 2025. But I would leave you with a higher volume level, it should help as tailwind."

            "name": "Greg Smith",
            "content": "Thank you, Traci. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, I will summarize our second quarter results and discuss the trends we are seeing in the semiconductor and Advanced Robotics industries. Then Sanjay will go into more depth about our second quarter results and forward looking guidance. At a high level the market dynamics that we identified in our April earnings call have continued through the second quarter. Cloud AI is driving strong demand across the SoC and memory test markets. We have accelerated engineering and sales investments to continue to improve our market position, drive share and increase our ability to deliver long-term sustainable growth. Outside of compute and memory, all other major test markets, including mobile, continue to be soft. Robotics has delivered on-plan results in a weak macro environment and we continue to expect incremental growth each quarter of this year. Focusing in on Q2, we delivered second quarter financial results above our revenue, gross margin and earnings guidance ranges. Memory and SoC delivered above our plan and showed strong performance in the quarter, primarily driven by AI applications. Continuing the trend we noted in the first quarter, Cloud AI demand drove compute revenue with considerable strength in networking devices. AI enabled data centers have a very high number of network connection points to support training large language models, which is changing the mix in this segment to include more networking silicon. Our historic strength in networking combined with shipments to support a vertically integrated producer or VIP resulted in compute revenue in the first half of 2024, exceeding all of our compute revenue in 2023. We currently expect that Teradyne's SoC revenue from the compute end market will be on par with mobile revenue this year. In memory AI driven HBM DRAM demand remains strong. We are now seeing AI driven servers pulling demand across a broader range of memory, including enterprise SSD NAND flash. We are also seeing memory demand for the mobile market with strength in LPDDR and continuing retooling to support the latest protocol based mobile flash memory technologies. As a result, our memory business has grown nearly 30% in the first half of 2024 compared to the first half of 2023. While we are not changing our estimated memory tam expectation for the year, we expect that the market is trending towards the upper end of our $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion forecast. Moving on to Q3, the positive impact of AI on test is expected to continue into the third quarter. However, a meaningful uptick in other end markets, including legacy auto and industrial, may not occur until the 2025 timeframe. As a result, at the company level for the full year, we continue to expect low single digit revenue growth from 2023. As a reminder, excluding the impact of the sale of DIS to Technoprobe, our 2024 revenue growth would have been a couple of percentage points higher. Now, turning to Robotics, despite a weak macro environment, our Advanced Robotics business grew sequentially from Q1 to Q2. Looking at the first half of 2024, we grew 11% compared to the first half of 2023. We estimate that traditional players in the automation space have seen sales actually decline in the range of 5% to 7% over the same period. We are executing a three-pronged growth strategy for our Advanced Robotics business; SAM expansion, channel transformation and recurring services and software. In the second quarter, we have made progress in all three areas. Hey CJ, this is Greg. Basically, we are pretty bullish on 2025. The Semi Test market in 2024, we're seeing strength in computing and we're also seeing fair amount of upgrade business where people are converting testers that were underutilized in mobile to use for compute and VIP applications, so that's soaking up some of the excess in that market. We expect that to really sort of accelerate business. As mobile returns in 2025, it won't have that capacity to grow into. On HBM, I think we continue to expect that we are going to make progress in two directions on HBM. One is that our share has primarily been in the pre-stack wafer test of HBM, and we believe that we're going to be gaining share in performance tests of the HBM memory after it's been stacked. And so we're hoping that we can expand both our market share within the account where we are participating in HBM and then also break into additional accounts for HBM and that would be more of a 2025 thing. So I think overall, our outlook for 2025 and into 2026 is in line with what we talked about in January. Sure. So we, I think the way that we're looking at VIP is right now, because that growth has been happening at a time when there is a fair amount of capacity in OSATs to soak up. We're actually trying to keep track of the number of testers that are being used for these VIP customers. And right now it's hundreds of testers. There are currently hundreds of testers that are being used for VIP and we expect that to end. We have, I guess we should probably call it multiple VIP customers that are loading significant numbers of testers. We have additional VIPs where they've made plan of record decisions to put their parts on our testers and those parts are going to be released later in this year and into 2025. So we think that we'll probably exit this year with twice as many testers being used for these vertically integrated producers than we have right now. Sure, yes. So we tend to think of the process nodes not as, from our Business perspective, not as a driver, but as an enabler. So the 2 nanometer or Gate-All-Around, they're going to be enablers for higher device complexity. But the thing that really drives our Business is whether the end market is pulling for that complexity. And we're really optimistic that between cloud AI and especially for edge AI like in mobile, that that is going to be a major driver for companies to get into N2 even at a faster rate than they got into N3. So we think that it's a good thing that the capacity is being put in place for N2 because we think that it's going to be needed. In addition, the deployment of edge AI, it's really going to increase complexity of the application processors. It's also going to be pulling harder on the mobile part of the memory market. So we think that there's sort of a virtuous circle in terms of the capacity being put in place, the end market demand that's going to use that capacity, and then the pull effect on other parts of the market enabled by the features that are going into these products. So we think basically this is going to be a good demand driver really through the rest of this midterm, 2025, 2026, 2027. So that's a good question, Mehdi, because there's a little bit of subtlety to this. So you're right that one of the reasons that our mobile revenue and our compute revenue are going to be comparable in 2024 is because the mobile market is weak. But the other reason is, and I talked about this in my prepared remarks, that our compute revenue for the first half is bigger than all of our compute revenue for 2023 and we see good strength for compute in the second half of this year as well. So, like, things are going great in compute. Next year, we think that compute is going to remain strong, but the TAM sizes for compute are likely to be in the same range, maybe a little bit stronger than where they were. The mobile market really should come back pretty strongly, and so our mobile revenue will come back with that. So we anticipate that we'll have good revenue growth in compute, but it's very possible that mobile will outweigh it next year because of the strength of that recovery. So let me take the second part of your question first, and then, actually, I'm going to tag team the first part with Sanjay because I want to work on sort of a history lesson perspective of the mobile TAM to try and bracket what we would see in 2025. But in terms of the modem supplier, for the our historically largest customer, a thing to remember is that whoever is supplying that modem is also likely supplying all of the ancillary devices associated with that modem. So there's a modem, there's power management, there's RF, and if that was to change, there's a lot of pluses and minuses. The thing that I will tell you is that they're all relatively small relative to the magnitude of the overall AP business. So if that was to change, I would expect it to be a slight positive for us, but I don't think it's a game changer kind of a thing. And so, on the mobile TAM, so Sanjay, could you just give us sort of the history of the mobile TAM, like over the past few years? Okay, so take what I'm going to say with a grain of salt, because we are entering into our strategic planning process and haven't completed sort of an updated view of 2025. But the thing that I will tell you is that the mobile TAMs are unlikely to go as high as we saw during the COVID peak, but they're likely to be significantly stronger than what we're seeing in 2023 and 2024. So going in the middle of that range might not be a bad idea, but it's a pretty big range. Vivek, does that help at all? That's a great question. So I think you are -- in terms of your hypothesis, you're hitting the nail on the head, that part of it is scale, part of it is channel. The thing that we are really -- we're actually really optimistic about our Robotics business right now, that the macro environment is really weak. Our automation peers are struggling with declining sales. We posted an 11% gain over the first half. And the thing that is encouraging to us is that that 11% gain is on the back of specific aspects of the strategy that we're executing. We were trying to expand our SAM [ph] by adding a high payload, high payload options for universal robots. And those robots are accounting for 20% of our sales in the quarter. We are trying to build additional channels, and our OEM channel grew by 70% year-on-year for the first half. We have additional irons in the fire to drive additional growth that have not yet paid off. And there are primarily other aspects of market expansion. So our Pallet Jack for the AMR business, additional products that are coming to market for UR as well. We have additional channels that we are building. We've been working for the last year and a half on building out a large accounts channel and we have significant pipeline for that, but we don't have significant revenue growth to see from it yet. And then finally, we think that there's a very significant revenue opportunity in service and recurring software. Right now, that's a vanishingly small part of our revenue in Robotics. But every business that has machinery in critical processes definitely needs to have a way to keep that stuff running. And we have an example in our semiconductor business, where service represents a significant portion of our overall revenue and we are trying to apply that same model of managed service plans in Robotics. And we're actually seeing good customer uptake, but not a lot of revenue yet. So we think that those three engines are going to be kicking in, in 2025, on top of growth that we're going to still get from the things that we've done in 2023 and 2024. So we're pretty optimistic that the end market is terrible, but we're actually doing what we said we were going to do in terms of the strategy. I'm really, really glad you asked that question. So there are a couple of things going on in the compute space around this topic of cloud AI and building large capabilities to do training of large language models. So the first is obviously huge demand for GPU's. That's why people have seen Nvidia run up as much. They are providing an incredibly valuable engine for all of this. But if you look at an AI enabled server, there is a much larger number of high speed data links within a server rack than there is for a traditional server. And so in more traditional accelerated computing, we were seeing a ratio of, within a specific account, it might be 90% GPUs, 10% networking, that's trending more towards 20% or even higher. So there's definitely a tailwind there that is beneficial. The other is, as these models become more sophisticated and the players in this space are trying to differentiate between these large language models, they're each trying to gain an advantage through architecture and that's driving this VIP design trend that we're seeing. So we think that there's enough end market demand to drive growth for both sort of traditional GPU based AI models and also drive even faster growth for the VIP or homegrown silicon that is being built into these large server firms. So, to answer the last part of your question first, I think we're very close to the point where the balance is going to tip back away from soaking up capacity to driving new system sales. The trends that we're seeing, third party data around test utilization are showing a good uptick, a little bit above sort of typical seasonality. Our own data is showing mixed utilization right now. We don't see a clear trend there, but we do have a fair amount of both systems that have already been converted and also upgrades that would be used as conversion kits. And so that is going to essentially occupy hundreds of testers that are underutilized now. So we are expecting utilization to tick up pretty strongly in the second half of this year, and for that to tip over to the point where it turns into real system demand. When you get to the IDM customers, especially in auto and industrial, there's an interesting, many of those customers are down significantly year-over-year from 2023 to 2024, but a lot of them are persisting in relatively aggressive capacity expansion plants. They see the same thing that we've been talking about in the automotive space, that there are going to be short-term fluctuations, but the crossover to EVs and hybrids is something that it's a question of like when, not if, that is going to happen and the amount of compute power in cars and other electronics in cars is going to continue to increase the attach rate of more chips per car shipped. So they have long-term plans to drive capacity and they have long-term plans for purchasing our equipment that we think is going to be important. So we are cautious about the current downturn that we're seeing in automotive, but we're really confident about the long-term potential in that space, especially parts of it where we have a ton of good share and great customer relationships like battery management, discrete in power and more and more importantly ADAS stuff. So right now I think the utilization in auto and industrial is down, but what the signals that we're hearing from those customers is that they expect that to be relatively short lived. Okay, so there's a lot to unpack there, so let's get down to it. So the story for MiR is pretty simple, that take a robot, add AI capability, and suddenly you have a robot that works better. That's our basic hypothesis behind the pallet jack, is that we're going to be able to have a higher success rate picking pallets than competing solutions. And so far, the customer reception is that they think that those claims have some merit. So we have a pretty strong backlog for a product that we're going to start shipping in Q4 of this year. So that's pretty simple. For UR, the story is a lot more complex because what we're really doing is creating a platform for our solution providers to build AI based solutions on. And there's actually like four chunks of an AI based solution on UR. At the bottom, you have our robot and the software that controls our robot. And then on top of that, there's AI toolkits that can come from Nvidia or can come from other providers that really give the primitives that allow people to use AI capabilities to solve problems. Then on top of that, there's usually a solution builder. And so what that solution builder will do is they'll take our robot and that toolkit and they will build a solution to do something like heterogeneous bin picking or vision based inspection or welding, and then they will take that solution and they will market it to their end customers. So the key thing that differentiates the UR platform from other robots is its features as a platform. So the APIs that people can use, the features that they need in order to build these solutions for, and that's what makes us sticky, is that once a solution provider builds a solution around a specific toolkit in our robot, it's tough for them to move off. The thing about that model for UR is that it's a slower burnt. That it's an indirect AI drives our business indirectly because we're not building the AI solution, our solution providers are. So I'll tell you that we have AI based solutions in the market. Right now, our estimate is that high single digits of UR sales are going into AI based applications that are in the market right now. So that's sort of our baseline and we intend to grow from there. These solution providers, it can take a while from when they begin building their solution to when they see a commercial inflection and that's often in excess of a year. So we have a great pipeline of partners that are using AI right now to try and build solutions and we would expect that to deliver material revenue in 2025, but not in 2024. So sorry for going deep, but you kind of hit a nerve. Okay. So on HBM, the primary difference from a test perspective, as you go from HBM3 to HBM3E to HBM4, is the data rates that are required in the performance test of the final HBM product and the capacity that's in place right now for HBM3, most of it, essentially all of it, is incapable of testing at the data rates required for HBM3E and HBM4. So the people that are building HBM3E are seeking additional capacity. They're essentially retooling to be able to test the HBM3E. Now, this is one of the areas where we believe we have an advantage that will allow us to gain share in HBM performance test, that we have a tester that is going to be effective for both HBM3E and HBM4. And so that essentially will give customers that adopt that solution longer asset life than if they were to adopt a competing solution. So we are pretty hopeful about our opportunity to gain share in HBM performance test and we're working on essentially benchmark competitions in multiple customers to try to prove that. So I think it'd probably be a good idea to do our TAM history lesson in compute as well, so really strong this year. Why don't we go back a couple of years and set that as context, and then we'll bracket kind of what we think we'll do in 2025. So, Sanjay, could you do that? So as you look into 2025, we don't think that we would see mammoth increases to the compute TAM. It is between 2x and 3x larger than it was in 2019 at this point in time. And for sure, people are trying to add capacity all through the production chain, but it's coming off of a really high base. So looking forward into next year, I would probably be looking at where we are this year, plus or minus something, versus a much -- a lot of increase in the compute space. Now, you asked about VIPs. Right now, VIPs are towards the low end of a $100 million to $200 million range. It could trend towards the high end of that by the end of this year. We think that by the time we get out to 2026, VIPs will be about $500 million of the overall compute spend. So I think that's a pretty exciting chunk. That could be a quarter to a third of the compute TAM could be driven by VIPs. So I guess the best thing to say is that at the point in time, there are two things that are going on since we set our plan. One is that the amount of underutilized capacity was larger than we thought at the point that we built our plan. The other thing that's happened since we built our plan is that even in 2024, compute has strengthened by a couple $100 million that the sort of the underlying demand drivers in the market are stronger than we were forecasting. So when you balance the deeper hole of utilization and the stronger end market demand then I think our hypothesis for 2026 holds. I'll actually let Sanjay answer that one. The mobility weakness is really both Android and iOS. If you look across the major suppliers for silicon for all of those ecosystems, it's generally pretty weak. Now, if you peel it back a little bit under the covers, there are some areas of the mobile space that have done better during this downturn than others. So one aspect of it is in image sensor, that the transition to, like 48 megapixel image sensors really put some pressure on the suppliers in that space, and they've added capacity both in iOS and Android land. The other is the improvements in wireless charging and other charging aspects that even now, when we've seen significant weakness in power and linear, we're still seeing some incremental demand as people always want their phones to charge faster. They want them to charge faster on wireless charging. So, we're seeing increased silicon content there. So it's been a little bit of a bright spot within that market. So, I think we've seen broad-based weakness in 2023 and continuing into 2024, and we expect to see relatively broad-based recovery in 2025. So, I will tell you that our OpEx acceleration is in both R&D and in our sales and marketing expenses. So you can infer from that that means that we're working on new products and we're working on building relationships with new customers and trying to capture. The key thing in semiconductors is that once customers make a platform decision, then it becomes very, very difficult to change their direction. And so we see a fleeting opportunity with all of the new VIPs to get in the door and influence that initial platform decision. So we're going to take those opportunities and we're going to make the investments to try to capture them while that share is available versus trying to move it after the cement sets. The one thing I will say is that the focus of our acceleration is really in our test business that we see that we have. We're confident in our strategy in Robotics, and we're confident for the OpEx plan that we put together. We saw no need to pour on more OpEx in our Robotics business. We're going to execute the plan that we set. But in the test business, especially in our semiconductor test business and in the system level test business, we saw an opportunity by accelerating our spend that we would be able to drive a better outcome long-term. So that's where that money's going. So it is mainly because the rollout of those programs. We're trying to make sure that we can walk before we run when it comes to these service programs. So we have essentially piloted the programs in a relatively small region and we're seeing good results in that region, but we have not deployed the program worldwide because we have to build out the infrastructure to support it. So that's why I say that we haven't seen material uptake is just because it isn't globally deployed at this point. Oh, definitely 2025. So in the back half of this year, we're going to be -- and also the sales cycle time for the service business is it's not terribly long, but it's probably a couple of quarters because you have to establish the value for the managed service plan. So we have a lot of interest. We are talking to a lot of customers, but we haven't closed the deals yet, because I think some of it is that it needs to be incorporated into their 2025 budgets. So, I'm very hopeful that we'll see an inflection in service revenue in 2025. I don't think we'll see much in terms of revenue in 2024. So our win rate on sockets, when we started describing our plans in VIPs, we said that we were trying to make sure that we got at least sort of an even split of sockets. And right now in 2024, that's kind of how it's playing out, that we're getting our fair share of wins. The other way that we're looking at this is in terms of testers loaded. So we're not looking at it in terms of tester purchases because of the underutilization, but we are trying to count noses in terms of how many testers are being loaded by our customers versus testers being loaded by our competition's customers. And right now I would say that we are kind of 60/40 in favor of Teradyne in terms of testers loaded for VIP customers. So right now it's not having a significant effect. The key thing that we are trying to do in the joint development projects that we have with Technoprobe is to take on relatively hard problems that required collaboration between us and Technoprobe that unless we had a firm partnership, we'd be unwilling to take that risk on speculation. We have initiated those projects, but they do require technology development on both sides. So right now, what we said at the point in time when we announced the deal is that we thought this would have a low-single-digit, long-term effect on market share in the Semi Test space. We still think that that's true and we think that we're on track to achieve those gains. So we haven't publicly announced sort of what segments of the market we are doing these joint development projects, because we think that we need to keep that relatively proprietary until we have demonstrated the success. But I will say that the key things that we believe are enabled by the projects that we're working on with Technoprobe are around devices that have very high power requirements and also devices that have very high parallelism. So the TPI probe technology is unlocking sort of the high end scalability of our test platforms in both SoC and memory. And we think that that's going to result in share gain by sort of opening up a place where both TPI and Teradyne are differentiated from their competition."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  \n It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Traci Tsuchiguchi, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you, Ms. Tsuchiguchi. You may begin. \nTraci Tsuchiguchi: Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our discussion of Teradyne's most recent financial results. I'm joined this morning by our CEO, Greg Smith; and our CFO, Sanjay Mehta. Following our opening remarks, we'll provide details of our performance for the first quarter of 2024 and our outlook for the second quarter of 2024.  \n The press release containing our first quarter results was issued last evening. We are providing slides on the Investor page of our website that may be helpful in following the discussion. Replays of this call will be available via the same page after the call ends. \n The matters that we discuss today will include forward-looking statements that involve risks that could cause Teradyne's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We caution listeners not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements included in this presentation. We encourage you to review the safe harbor statement contained in slides accompanying this presentation as well as the risk factors described in our annual report on the 10-K with the SEC.  \n Additionally, these forward-looking statements are made only as of today. During today's call, we will make reference to non-GAAP financial measures. We have posted additional information concerning these non-GAAP financial measures including reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure where available on the Investor Relations page of our website. Looking ahead between now and our next earnings call, Teradyne expects to participate in technology or investor-focused investor conferences, hosted by JPMorgan, KeyBanc, Cowen, Bernstein and Stifel.  \n Following Greg and Sanjay's comments this morning, we'll open up the call for questions. This call is scheduled for 1 hour. Greg? \nGregory Smith: Thanks, Traci. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us this morning. Today, I will summarize our first quarter results and discuss some of the trends in the semiconductor industry and robotics that we believe position Teradyne for long-term growth. It is useful to comprehend these longer-term growth drivers because the industries in which we operate are inherently cyclical. Sanjay will then provide greater financial detail on our first quarter results, our current outlook and additional financial information. \n We delivered first quarter financial results above our revenue, gross margin and earnings guidance ranges. Memory and SOC delivered above our plan and showed strong performance in the quarter driven primarily by AI applications. The impact of AI on our business was seen in networking as well as in Edge AI applications like ADAS. Over 40% of our memory shipments in the first quarter were driven by AI applications.  \n As we expected, mobile continued to be soft in the first quarter. Our robotics business delivered to planned for the third consecutive quarter as their go-to-market execution continues to improve.  \n Moving on to Q2. The impact of AI on test demand we experienced in the first quarter is continuing into the second quarter, improving our outlook in memory and in compute. However, a meaningful upturn in mobile, legacy auto and industrial end markets may not occur until the 2025 time frame.  \n Looking ahead, within the semiconductor test market, we expect that the compute TAM, which includes networking in many vertically integrated producers to grow at a faster pace than previously expected. We now estimate the compute TAM in 2024 to be $1.5 billion, up from $1.4 billion. We have lowered our TAM estimates for auto, industrial and mobile markets as recovery in these end markets appears to be pushing out in time. With the combination of our stronger first half and limited visibility into the second half, our estimate of the 2024 SOC TAM remains unchanged at $3.6 billion to $4.2 billion.  \n In memory test, we are increasing our expectation TAM growth to $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion from our prior estimate of $1 billion to $1.1 billion, driven mainly by stronger demand for HBM, which we expect to grow 5x last year's level. As I'm sure you've noticed, our first quarter results and second quarter expectations are significantly above our view from January. For the full year, at the company level, we continue to expect low single-digit growth from 2023. \n In January, we are expecting the year to be back half loaded with mobile driving that recovery. We also shared that lead times were decreasing and our visibility was limited. The sustained strength and new demand in AI-driven applications are boosting our business in the first half. However, we are being cautious on the second half on what looks like continued weakness in the mobile market. Our operations team is continuing to enable us to pursue short lead time opportunities, so it certainly feels as if there's more upside opportunity than downside risk.  \n Now turning to robotics. The first quarter is typically quite weak for our robotics business, and this year is no exception. We were very pleased to see the team deliver on plan and are expecting sequential growth in the second quarter. We are executing a plan which we expect to deliver 10% to 20% growth in 2024. This plan includes three elements: first is SAM expansion through new offerings. Second is growing our OEM solution provider in large account channels. Third is building increased recurring revenue through service and software offerings.  \n In the first quarter, we made good progress in all of these areas. We executed on new SAM expanding initiatives with the announcement of UR's collaboration with NVIDIA and the new MiR1200 pallet jack. We grew our UR OEM business 58% year-on-year, and we received the single largest order in the history of MiR from a strategic customer.  \n Zooming out, we see AI as the transformational secular growth driver across all of our businesses. AI applications are already having a profound impact on the test market, but we are in the very early days of the growth trend that will play out over the coming years. Today, the profit pool generated from AI is concentrated in the build-out of cloud AI capabilities, especially for training LLMs on huge data sets. \n The hardware requirements for training are massive and include general purpose fine grain compute, high bandwidth memory, dense network interconnection, and mammoth amounts of power, all of which are driving our business today. However, these LLMs will only deliver a business impact when they're used to solve problems in the real world. In other words, through inference applications, both in the cloud and at the edge. \n This is the key opportunity that is driving vertically integrated producers to develop their own devices and will materially affect the complexity of edge processors in automotive, industrial and mobile applications.  \n While our business is benefiting today from the considerable AI-driven growth in memory, networking and a few early ramps of vertically integrated producers, our greatest opportunity lies ahead as inference applications and edge AI accelerates because of our strong position with many of the leading providers of mobile and embedding computing in industrial and ADAS applications.  \n AI will also have a profound impact on the robotics industry. Teradyne Robotics is focused on collaborative applications, where robots need to work safely and efficiently in complex environments. AI provides an opportunity to more easily deploy robots that understand and adapt to their surroundings, making them more resilient and expanding the range of problems that they can address. With our layered approach to safety, high product quality and an open platform ecosystem, UR and MiR, are positioned as the preferred robotics platforms for the development of AI manufacturing and logistics solutions.  \n Last month, we announced a collaboration with NVIDIA to utilize their robotics stack on UR hardware and demonstrated the power of that collaboration at GTC with a visual inspection application. Also in the first quarter, we announced the MiR1200 pallet jack, a new AI-powered solution that uses 3D Vision to identify, pick up and deliver pallets even in dynamic and complex environments, making it a valuable resource for autonomous material handling in factories and warehouses.  \n Advanced robotics is just one of the many early examples of Edge AI applications positively impacting our business. Others include advanced driver assistance systems and AI capabilities being added to premium tier mobile handsets. Edge AI is becoming a material driver of TAM growth for Semi Test, but we're in very early days. We expect AI will be an overarching growth driver for years to come in test as a primary demand driver and in robotics as a key enabler of market growth. We're positioned to benefit from this megatrend, and we're investing R&D and field resources to capture this opportunity.  \n Summing up the quarter, we're off to a strong start with Q1 results and our outlook for Q2 well ahead of our view just 3 months ago. The strength and test is focused on cloud and edge AI applications, while other parts of the semiconductor industry work through inventory. Calling the end of these corrections is a challenge. So we're being cautious about our second half outlook. That said, our flexible operations model will enable us to serve upside demand. We expect that industrial, automotive and mobile will rebound from their current low levels and entirely new demand drivers like AI are already contributing to our Test business. The industry's increase in WFE spend in 2024 and 2025 will drive unit volume and device complexity growth, reinforcing our confidence in our midterm outlook.  \n And with that, I'll turn the call over to Sanjay. Sanjay? \nSanjay Mehta: Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover the financial summary of Q1, provide our Q2 outlook and full year planning assumptions. Now to Q1. First quarter sales were $600 million, which was $10 million above the high end of our guidance with non-GAAP EPS of $0.51, which was above the high end of our guidance of $0.38. Non-GAAP gross margins were 56.6%, above our guidance due to favorable product mix, higher volumes and improved operational efficiencies. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $251 million, both flat year-over-year and up slightly compared to our fourth quarter. Non-GAAP operating profit was approximately 15%. \n Turning to our revenue breakdown in Q1. Semi Test revenue for the quarter was $412 million, with SOC revenue contributing $302 million and memory, $110 million. In memory, our sales were strongest in DRAM as AI-driven demand remains strong. Test for HBM is being prioritized by our customers, and we are seeing customers transition capital spending for testers away from flash to DRAM, in part due to HBM and the return of capacity adds and other DRAM test.  \n Historically, we've seen split between flash and DRAM markets be more balanced. In System Test group, Q1 revenue was $75 million, with $23 million in storage test on low SLT and HDD demand. Recall, SLT has high exposure to the smartphone market. And even as HDD end markets begin to recover, tester capacity utilization rates remain low. In Wireless Test, revenue was $25 million in Q1, reflecting continued weakness in PC and mobile markets. In Q2, we expect wireless test to improve due to gaming end market and are now beginning to see the ramp of WiFi 7.  \n Now to robotics. Revenue was $88 million as planned with UR contributing $68 million and MiR, $20 million. Shifting to some cash metrics. At a company level, our free cash flow was an outflow of $37 million in the quarter. We typically consume cash in the first quarter as we pay taxes and variable employee compensation. We repurchased $22 million of shares in the quarter and paid $18 million in dividends. We ended the quarter with $871 million in cash and marketable securities.  \n Some other financial information in Q1. We had one 10% customer in the quarter. The tax rate, excluding discrete items for the fourth quarter was 15% on a GAAP basis and 15.5% on a non-GAAP basis. In Q1, we incurred an FX loss on the fair value of the currency exchange hedge related to the expected investment in Technoprobe. This drove a larger than typical variance between our GAAP and non-GAAP earnings in the quarter.  \n Turning to our current operational environment. In Semi Test, supply lead times continue to decline as supply versus demand is more in line. Our lead times continue to hold at 1 to 2 quarters. However, in some cases, we have been able to service demand inside these lead times. As a result, our customers are moving back towards historical buying patterns with shorter lead times, thus yielding lower second half 2024 visibility consistent with the pre-pandemic environment. Robotics remains a quick turns business and our execution continues to deliver to these market conditions.  \n Now turning to our outlook for Q2. Q2 sales are expected to be between $665 million and $725 million with non-GAAP EPS in a range of $0.64 to $0.84 and 162 million diluted shares. The second quarter guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles and the anticipated gain on the expected sale of DIS, which is $0.29 in our GAAP forecast.  \n Some color around the forecasted increase to Q2 revenue versus our January view. The increase is driven by our Semi Test business where ADAS, compute networking and HBM demand has strengthened. As noted, this AI strength has continued into the second quarter and some orders initially scheduled for shipment in the third quarter have moved into the second quarter, improving our near-term outlook. Second quarter gross margins are estimated at 57% to 58%. OpEx is expected to run at 36% to 39% of second quarter sales, up modestly from Q1. Non-GAAP operating profit rate at the midpoint of our second quarter guidance is 20%.  \n A few points to assist you in modeling the rest of the year. I'll start with a few more details about the market estimates Greg provided. While our view of the SOC TAM is unchanged in total, under the cover, there are some puts and takes. Compute is up approximately $100 million, while mobile, auto and industrial are down a little over $100 million in aggregate. In anticipation of questions, let me provide the midpoint of our estimates by segment. Compute, $1.5 billion; mobile, $0.9 billion; auto MCU, $0.5 billion; Industrial, $0.3 billion; and service, $0.7 billion, summing up to $3.9 billion for SOC.  \n You'll notice the aggregate decline change has been allocated to the Industrial segment. Our memory estimate has increased $200 million with the midpoint of $1.25 billion. Please note, our final estimate for the 2023 SOC TAM is $4 billion, up $100 million in the Compute segment from our January view.  \n Back to revenue. We expect Q3 sales to be similar to Q2 and Q4 to improve from there. Note that our flattish sequential growth in Q3 does not assume any revenue from DIS. Excluding the impact of the anticipated divestiture, we would expect revenue to grow sequentially in Q3. Our expectation for revenue distribution for the full year is now less back half weighted than our view in January. We currently expect around 47% of the company revenue to be in the first half and 53% in the second half. We expect full year revenue to grow in the low single-digit range compared to 2023.  \n Now to gross margins. Gross margins are expected to continue to improve as we progress through the year and should be at our target gross margin model for the fourth quarter. Full year gross margins will likely be in the 58% to 59% range unchanged from our January outlook.  \n Regarding OpEx for the full year. We expect full year 2024 OpEx to grow 5% to 7%, consistent with prior guide as we continue to make engineering and go-to-market investments. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate, excluding discrete items, are forecasted to be 15% to 15.5%, respectively, in 2024.  \n A quick update on our previously announced strategic partnership with Technoprobe. As a reminder, the agreement has several key components. First, Technoprobe will purchase Teradyne's DIS business, which provides advanced interfaces that connect our testers to customers' chips for test. Second, Teradyne will make an equity investment in Technoprobe, acquiring 10% of the company. Third, Teradyne and Technoprobe will work together on a series of projects to expand the performance of semiconductor device interfaces to enable customers to realize the full performance of our test systems. We continue to expect the transactions to close in the second quarter.  \n DIS revenue contribution for the first quarter was approximately $21 million. Post closing, our cash position will decline as the transaction is expected to consume an estimated $440 million of net cash. We will continue to limit our share buybacks in 2024 to an amount necessary to offset dilutions from equity compensation and our employee share purchase program in order to build cash back to a minimum goal of $800 million.  \n Summing up, we delivered sales and earnings above the high end of our guidance range as memory and networking exceeded our plan in Semi Test, mainly driven by AI. The mobile, industrial and legacy auto markets remain soft. Our robotics team delivered to plan for the third consecutive quarter, as we continue to execute our new product development and go-to-market strategies. Overall, visibility beyond the second quarter is limited, given the increased level of turns business in Semi Test. Our first quarter performance and the improvement in our second quarter outlook elevates our confidence for the year. Midterm fundamentals remain intact, yielding continued optimism beyond 2024.  \n With that, I'll turn the call back to Traci. Traci? \nTraci Tsuchiguchi: Thanks. We will go ahead with questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. \nMehdi Hosseini: Yes. Two follow-up. It seems to me that despite the fact that you highlighted mobile as an area of weakness, it had already been dialed into your January guide or commentary for the full year. Would that be fair? \nSanjay Mehta: Yes, it would, Mehdi. \nMehdi Hosseini: Okay. And this brings up what I want to really ask you. When I look at TSMC, they just announced their annual report, and obviously, Apple's mix of revenue went up. And I'm using that as a kind of trying to better understand the dynamics. So if TSMC is running or generating more revenues, that means more chips for that particular customer is coming out. And at some point, utilization rate for those testers are going to hit that 85%, 90% threshold. And I'm trying to look beyond the next couple of quarters.  \n Are you also thinking that at some point in the next 2 to 4 quarters, those utilization rates are going to get to the point where even if that particular customer of TSM were to continue with kind of bifurcation of their technology node, they would still have to come back to the market and buy more testers? \nGregory Smith: Mehdi, this is Greg. I think you've got it right that utilization is continuing to increase. The equipment that is in place is being used quite efficiently through the year. So the loading is relatively constant. And we definitely believe that it's a matter of when, not if there's going to be a need for significant additional capacity to support that kind of product line. \nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. \nVivek Arya: On the compute TAM, the $1.5 billion, I think that's up roughly 15% from last year. When I look at the size of the accelerator market this year, it's supposed to double. So is that one kind of high-level way to look at how much the accelerator market is growing versus how much your tester compute TAM is growing? Or is there a different way? So for example if, let's say, the accelerated market grows 30% next year, what does that imply for your compute TAM? \nGregory Smith: Interesting question. Thinking about the TAM, that is the overall size of the market, so what we would get, what our competitor would get. And the size of the accelerator market has gone up a lot this year. Most of the testers to support this year's revenue in accelerators was put in place last year. So if the TAM that was supported last year supporting that sort of big growth that we've seen in the end market this year, what's going to happen this year, the $1.5 billion that we talked about is going to support a significant increase again next year. \n And this year, the primary beneficiary in terms of that end market is NVIDIA. What we're seeing now is that we are having some vertically integrated producers start to have significant ramps and they're already loading significant numbers of testers. The TAM in 2024 for compute is actually a little bit constrained below what it would otherwise be because these new entrants are actually able to work with their OSAT partners and convert idle testers that would have been in mobile into the compute space.  \n So right now, the loading of compute testers is higher than it was than what you'd see in terms of the buys in the market. As mobile starts to come back, that means that there's less idle capacity to fill. It also means that the compute market is going to be translated into more direct buys. \nSanjay Mehta: And if I could add just a quick comment. In my prepared remarks, we noted that the -- our estimate was revised for 2023 for the compute market. When I do the math of our midpoint of $1.5 billion in '24 versus our old, you do get a 15% increase, but we revised that in my prepared remarks, I noted to $1.4 billion. So I think the growth is 7% versus 15%. I just wanted to point that out. \nVivek Arya: And just a quick follow-up. A number of your WFE peers have started to see the benefits of 2-nanometer and gate-all-around. I'm wondering what does that mean for Teradyne? When will you start to see those benefits? And what does that mean for tester intensity? I assume that's more '25 or '26. Any color around that would be very useful. \nGregory Smith: Sure. So we are expecting to see some testers being used to support the engineering work in early parts in 2-nanometer probably towards the end of 2025. We don't expect any volume associated with 2-nanometer gate-all-around until 2026. And the way that we're looking at that right now is that there's nothing particularly idiosyncratic about that node in terms of tester demand.  \n So we're thinking of it primarily as an enabler to more complex parts. There are a lot of parts, for example, for cloud AI training that at this point are actually reticle limited, and so anything to allow increased complexity within the same die size is likely to be soaked up by AI. And so the faster that 2-nanometer comes online, the faster these more complex parts will be developed, and those will likely have longer test times, higher test intensity, which will drive the TAM. \nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. \nToshiya Hari: I had one question on memory and another one on your VIP business. On the memory side, you guys talked about a $1.25 billion TAM for '24. I was hoping you could provide a rough split between DRAM and NAND, how you're viewing the market, what the contribution could be from HBM, and if you can speak to your competitive position, your market share position within HBM, that would be helpful. \nSanjay Mehta: Sure. Why don't I take the numbers, and maybe the competitive position, Greg, if you want to take? So the range that we provided was $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, with the midpoint of $1.25 billion. And we think from a DRAM perspective, it's roughly 80% of that versus flash of 20%. Historically, I would say DRAM has been in the 40% and 50% of the overall memory market. So that's roughly the split. And then HBM we think is -- yes, we think that number is about $500 million. It's going to work upwards, but we think that number is above $500 million out of the $1.25 billion. \nGregory Smith: So in terms of competitive position, the share patterns that have existed for a few years are persisting. We have very high share in flash final test, we have strong share position in DRAM final test and we have a lower share position in both flat wafer sort and DRAM wafer sort. So what's happening in the memory market? Like last year, there was a lot of technology-driven buys that were pushing final test purchases. This year, the spark is coming back to the memory market, and that is driving the need for more capacity, and that is driving wafer sort purchases.  \n So there's no customer losses, but we are expecting to see our share come down a little bit this year as those wafer start capacity buys go in. Now the subtext underneath that is, HBM is a wafer-level technology, so all of the tests for HBM falls into that wafer sort space. And in HBM, last year, we had about 50% of the test TAM for HBM. This year, we're expecting that, that is going to come down modestly in terms of share. Our revenue is going to be up significantly, but the market is 5x bigger. So our share is probably going to float down a little bit as people begin to tool up next generation for the volume expansion in HBM.  \n At the same time, we think that our opportunities for share gain in terms of new test insertions for HBM are quite good. And so we're projecting that we're going to be penetrating new customers and new test steps for that this year. \nToshiya Hari: Great. And then as my follow-up on the VIP side, we've all seen quite a few announcements from the Googles, the Amazons, the Metas of the world in terms of what they're working on. I'm curious when those announcements kind of translate into revenue for you guys. I know it takes time for those projects to ramp. But I think you have pretty good visibility as a test provider, you're probably pulled into those projects early. So is it a '25 dynamic, is it '26? And how should we think about that contribution as some of those projects ramp? \nGregory Smith: Well, from a vertically integrated producer perspective, it really kind of started back in like 2022, 2023. In 2024, like right now, there are hundreds of testers that are being used to test VIP source parts for us. And probably a similar number from our competitor. So it has happened. The thing that hasn't happened because of the -- the low utilization driven by the mobile slowdown, that hasn't translated into as much new tester purchases as we would have expected in a stronger market. \n But we have multiple VIP sockets that are loading more than 50 testers each, and we have a pipeline of new design starts that we are plan of record for that will stretch out all the way into 2026. So this is real. It's happening now, but the impact on our financial results has been muted by the low utilization because of the mobile downturn. \nOperator: Next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. \nChristopher Muse: Yes. I guess first question, Greg, in your prepared remarks, you talked about cautiousness on the second half, though seeing better upside opportunity than downside risk. So I was hoping to dig deeper into that. If you could share what would be the end markets that could be upward [indiscernible] as we progress through the year. \nGregory Smith: So we have limited visibility, so just bear in mind that I'm going into the realm of speculation here. The things that could drive a higher second half is the leading edge of some sort of a recovery in mobile. Right now, we have a pretty low baseline baked into our plan. So essentially any capacity shortfalls would immediately turn into business.  \n And then the other is, we've seen such a dramatic strengthening in the Compute segment with very short lead times in Q1. So that's what really drove our increased outlook for Q2. So we didn't see it coming. We had hints that it was coming. We thought it would be further out and smaller. It has come in bigger and faster than we expected. If that trend were to continue, then we'd see continued strengthening in the compute space, and that's another thing that could drive a second half up.  \n The other way to think about that is we don't really think that industrial and automotive is going to significantly strengthen in the year. That's more of a 2025 thing. \nChristopher Muse: Very helpful. As a follow-up, you talked briefly on Edge AI. And so I was curious to hear your thoughts on how you see that play out in the smartphone arena. It sounds like this is a year where everyone is trying to see what sticks and what use cases and then maybe next year is the year. Would love to hear whether you agree with that assessment? When you think the earliest we could see increased content to support Edge AI and smartphones? And how you see that playing out and impact Teradyne's test business? \nGregory Smith: Yes. So that's a great question. We've been having very rich discussions internally about this to try and figure out when you consider a smartphone to be AI-enabled. And we're thinking about it in terms of the complexity of the processor that goes into the phone. There have been neural processing units and AI features in phones for years. But now, the AI opportunity, the edge AI opportunity is driving things towards pushing the amount of silicon area used for AI up towards like 50% or 1/3 of the silicon area going into that.  \n So those types of processors are just starting to hit the market now at the premium tier. And I think we've got about a year of people trying to figure out what kind of customer features will actually be compelling using that. And right now, there aren't that many of them. I think that, that's what's going to happen during the rest of 2024, that there's some premium smartphones and some people that are trying to innovate the things to do with them. I think the processer generation that's really going to start having enough power to do LLM stuff on a phone is probably the stuff that would ramp towards the end of 2025, and it would become much more mainstream in the generation of silicon coming out in '26. \nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan Chase. \nSamik Chatterjee: Maybe just to stick with the mobile ecosystem a bit. Any sort of change in your thinking about the primary smartphone customer there? I know you've said previously, it's less than 10% is what your expectation for this year is. Just checking in terms of how much of the sort of change in 2Q or sort of thinking about the back half, any changes in how you think about the cadence of purchases from the primary customer or any change in your overall taking for the year for that customer. \nGregory Smith: I hope I caught all of your question. If I didn't, then please correct me. We don't comment about specific customers. I will share that we don't expect that our historically largest customer will be a 10% customer this year. I'll also share that we think that there is more of -- that we've gotten sort of the bottom dialed into our plan, that there's definitely more upside to downside in terms of the plan associated with mobile in general. \nSamik Chatterjee: Got it. And you got that question. So for my follow-up, if I can ask on robotics. Can you give us some sense of how you're thinking about first half versus second half there? And what's the -- right now, any updated thinking on profitability for the year for the business? How do you track in 1Q and sort of how you're thinking about the full year for robotics. \nGregory Smith: So I'll start off with sort of a qualitative answer in terms of the drivers, but then I'll pass it off to Sanjay to give you more of the precise split first half, second half and the profitability. So what's going on right now is we have a plan for the year that's going to be essentially sequentially growing quarter by quarter. And the reason that the plan is laid out that way is because there are new growth drivers that are coming online throughout the year. There are drivers that are in place from last year in Q1, that's specifically the UR20 and UR30, the heavy payload cobots.  \n In Q1, we had the announcement of the MiR1200 pallet jack. That's going to start really impacting revenue in the back half, primarily in the fourth quarter, but we're already taking orders. We're building backlog for that product. We also announced the collaboration with NVIDIA. That's going to really drive business through our OEM solution channel. So we're going to be providing the platform tools to that channel, so that they can create stuff that goes to market. So that's stuff that will also be back half loaded.  \n The other thing that's driving through the year is we are continuing to build our OEM channel and our large accounts channel. So those are things that we started. We started OEMs back in '22, we started large accounts in '23, and they have a significant amount of gestation time before they deliver revenue. We're right at the point where OEMs are starting to really click. We talked about the 58% year-on-year increase in that space. I'm expecting to see growth above the aggregate growth for large accounts in 2024. So that's going to be a growth driver through the end of the year.  \n So with that, I'll pass it off to Sanjay to give you sort of the precise breakdowns. \nSanjay Mehta: So roughly the first half of the year -- well, first, as Greg noted, we expect to grow sequentially in Q2, and we expect to grow throughout the year for the reasons Greg just noted. But in the first half, we have 42%-ish plus or minus, and then 58% in the back half of the year. We do expect to be profitable this year. I would say, over the year, and I would say that, that would be single-digit profitability. I will comment, I think you asked about Q1. We were not profitable just given the seasonality of the quarter. That should give you the context, I think that you asked. \nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar with TD Cohen. \nSreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: I had a couple of them. First one, on the memory side, how much of your memory revenues were from HBM in the March quarter. And I think Sanjay, you mentioned HBM revenues could grow 5x this year. I'm kind of curious, are you over-indexed to 1 customer, because my understanding is of the 3 HBM customers, 1 of them in sources, and within other 2, can you just talk a little bit about your share position there? Then I have a follow-up. \nSanjay Mehta: I'll take the first one on the memory in the quarter. Yes. So I want to say roughly about 45% of the memory revenue that we had was tied in the first quarter to HBM. \nGregory Smith: Yes. So Krish, one quick comment. The 5x comment about HBM was referring to the market size for HBM memory. So last year was about $100 million of TAM for HBM. This year, we think it's about $500 million worth of TAM for HBM. Our revenue is not going to go up by a factor of 5. It's going to go up. It's going to go up significantly. But we're not going to be able to hold sort of the 50-ish percent share of HBM that we had last year. \n Are we over indexed to one customer? Well, the entire world is significantly over-indexed to one supplier in HBM. And that certainly has been driving our results to a great degree, both last year and will continue to drive our results this year. The other suppliers that are coming online. One of them is primarily internally based for test. We don't have any of that baked into our plan, although we think that they would be better off using our equipment, we haven't convinced them of that yet. And the other supplier in this space is a great customer of ours, although our share there is lower than our share in the leader in this space right now. So that's another reason that we expect to dilute our share a little bit this year.  \n The other point that I'll make is I was saying that we like our chances in terms of getting into new insertions for HBM memory this year. I think that, that's an important point. And we are hopeful that, that's going to be delivering significantly higher revenue for us through the midterm. \nSreekrishnan Sankarnarayanan: Very helpful, very helpful. And then just a quick follow-up. You spoke about your revenue trajectory for the year. You said September should be similar to June and then growth in 4Q. I was just curious because that seems to be against normal seasonality. So what's the deviation this year? \nSanjay Mehta: Yes. Interesting question. I'd say that I remember several years back when we talked about we were going into a downturn and that downturn was 4 to 6 quarters, and the downturn has gone a lot longer in the way of mobility. And as Greg noted, we believe that our forecast considers mobility at a point where we feel comfortable that it's going to be achieved. And so I think as things pick back up, the historical seasonality, I put it in the context of some segments are going to be recovering and we have some new segments that are -- or some segments that are growing fairly well. So I think the seasonality comment with regards to the test perspective, or test portfolio of businesses we have. It's a little bit off this year. \nGregory Smith: This is Greg. Just one additional bit of color. If you think about the seasonality pattern that we developed really for a decade, 2010 through 2021, that seasonality, if you looked at all of our segments with the exception of mobile, there wasn't a really marked seasonality. Like those automotive, compute, industrial, they kind of chugged along. The seasonality was really driven by the mobile TAM, and that was driven by consumer buying behavior, right, that you needed to have things for the holiday season and for Lunar New Year. All of that inventory needed to be built up. And so there was a concentration of capacity that would go in, in Q2 and Q3, with mobile not driving right now, the seasonality is very, very muted. So I would expect to see that the seasonality will return once the mobile market is stronger, but I don't think you can use normal patterns to predict the way things will look in '24. \nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. \nJoseph Moore: I wonder if you could talk to the smartphone issues that you just mentioned. Away from your biggest customer, you sort of saw the smartphone suppliers reduce balance sheet inventory by 15, 20 days in Q4. And they talked about doing that again in Q1. So I would expect you to have low visibility, but shouldn't you get some recovery as they stop depleting that much inventory? Is there any kind of nuance in terms of how much of that inventory has been tested already in die bank, things like that. But shouldn't we have some optimism that this is going to get better. \nGregory Smith: Well, I think we certainly have optimism that it can get better. And that's basically because we've dialed in the bottom. And the way we do this is we typically will look at tester utilization numbers. And frankly, those numbers are all over the map. Some indicators show that capacity is tightening. Other indicators are showing that it's relatively -- utilization is tightening. Others show that it's relatively flat. Our qualitative checks, when we are talking to people in the ecosystem, they are telling us that capacity -- that utilization is getting tighter and it's forecast to go up from there. \n So the thing that, that hasn't done is it hasn't turned into firm forecast for additional business. And there is a fair amount of -- I think the lack of visibility that we see, it runs all the way through the supply chain that people are wondering what's going to happen. People are wondering how well handset sales will recover? And I think it's really going to come down to the way that the holiday season demand is shaping up. That's the thing that's going to be the lever that either turns on some additional spot buys or we'll have people waiting until 2025. \nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Brian Chin with Stifel. \nBrian Chin: Just to clarify, maybe firstly, was the third quarter pull-in, was that for AI, for compute, or for memory, or for both? And just to be clear, your share of the $200 million memory TAM increase, should we think about that being closer to, say, 40% if the emphasis is on wafer sort. And kind of sorry one more part to this. But I didn't catch this earlier, but if HBM demand is biased to a single customer, do you expect memory sales to be lumpy this year kind of from a quarterly perspective? \nSanjay Mehta: Yes, I'll take the kind of the Q3 to Q2. It was, I'd say, mainly in compute and some ADAS that was accelerated and -- just looking up something. \nGregory Smith: Yes. So in terms of the TAM increase, we moved the TAM up by $200 million. And I think -- I think your guess of $40 million is a bit low. I think we'll be up a bit more than -- we'll get a larger chunk of that up than that, probably in line with our historical share level, kind of 35% to 40% of that TAM increase should probably go to us. In terms of lumpy sales, no, I think actually the memory business is driving -- we have deliveries that will be stretching out through the year. And I think the demand is relatively steady and potentially increasing. So I think on a quarterly basis, we don't expect a lot of memory variation. \nBrian Chin: Okay. That's helpful. And then switching gears to robotics. It seems like your omnichannel and new product focus is driving a lot of this improved momentum in that business. But can you also just touch on the broader environment you're seeing in robotics, and where, if any, you see sort of macro like headwinds or tailwinds? And last part of that, what vertical or application was that customer that placed the record MiR order? And did that include any of the MiR1200s? \nGregory Smith: Okay. So in terms of the macro environment, it's pretty weak. I mean it was weak throughout 2023, and we don't see a significant improvement right now in terms of the end market conditions. If you look at PMIs, some regions are clicking up slightly, but we haven't really seen that turned into like a hot market. Having said that, we're in a part of the robotics market that is very, very low penetration. And so we are not -- we have seen our business results vary with the macro conditions, and we think that, that is indicative of the -- that was one of the things that drove us to go and make the changes in terms of adding new products and driving channel development, because we think we're 5% of the way into something that could be huge.  \n And if that's the case, then we should be somewhat immune to these cycles. But we've been looking at like industrial robot competitors and their results this quarter have been pretty meager. Like especially if you look at their incoming order rates, which is more comparable, they have long lead times. We have short lead times. So it's better for us to compare their orders to our orders. We feel like we are doing far better than they are in these end market conditions. But we're really focused on kind of controlling our own destiny by finding the things that need support even when the end market is [indiscernible].  \n One thing that I'll say is looking at other sort of industrial analyst notes and talking to people in that space, they are expecting improved strength like they think that things are going to get better, not worse. So I'm optimistic that we're going to have some macro tailwinds in addition to the plan that we baked, that's kind of counting on things staying around where they are. \nOperator: Next question comes from the line of Gus Richard with Northland Capital. \nAuguste Richard: Congratulations on the results. On the Industrial Automation, you've got a partnership with NVIDIA on AI. And sort of one on the limiters to penetration is the lack of a VAR channel, having to have to work with people to implement this stuff. Does multimodal AI or AI in general sort of simplify the implementation? Can you simplify the programming and implementation of robotics with that infusion of AI? \nGregory Smith: Yes. So for sure, the great thing about AI, there are two primary benefits to AI. One is that it's far easier to design a solution that is able to deal with variation, whether it's part variation or location variation or other uncertainties that exist in normal manufacturing environments, the solutions end up being far more resilient. So that means that more people would be willing to adopt them. \n People don't want to put fragile things into production and AI will help make things more robust. The simplicity of developing things is definitely a huge benefit of AI. So the demonstration that we did at GTC was a pretty sophisticated visual inspection application. And because we were leveraging a really powerful AI stack from NVIDIA, we were able to put that together in less than 2 weeks. It was a very fast turnaround to be able to build that solution. And we expect that both customers and customers and especially solution providers are going to be able to leverage that and create solutions to categories of problems that will help drive growth. \nAuguste Richard: Got it. And then on the semi test side, you've got sort of -- it's going to be a while before we get to 2 nanometers, yields at 3. I don't think we're that great. And the AI accelerators are reticle limited. How are you seeing the expansion of use of chiplets sort of beyond AI accelerators and servers and FPGAs. Is that beginning to broaden out? \nGregory Smith: Not really. Well, one thing is that most of the advanced packaging capacity in the world has been consumed by the people who are doing cloud AI, high-performance computing. So there's more demand than there is supply for it. So I think that's limiting it to the markets that are willing to pay the most for the ability to do it. I think that it's possible that chiplet technology will migrate out of high-performance computing potentially -- I mean it could potentially migrate into some mobile applications. I think that's going to be a relatively slow process because the price points are very, very different.  \n And then I think for industrial and automotive AI applications, it's likely to be a long time before you see chiplet technology in there because of the reliability and temperature range questions. It's a much more challenging environment to try and put packages. But that's kind of my view. I think that there are people that have a more aggressive view in terms of where chiplets will go. \nOperator: We have time for one last question. The next question comes from the line of Steve Barger with KeyBanc Capital Markets. \nSteve Barger: I'll be quick. Greg, you said share gain opportunities in HBM are good. Is that primarily due to you having capacity to support a fast-growing addressable market, or is there something unique in your current or future testers that will make you a supplier of choice for some variations of HBM? \nGregory Smith: I think it's definitely the latter. So we believe we have a differentiated solution, both in terms of ability to support data rates out through HBM 4 and also in terms of being able to use same platform across multiple insertions. So we think that we have an ability to deliver more cost-effective performance test of HBM, and we believe that we're going to make some progress there. \nSteve Barger: Understood. And for the large account channel in robotics, you said there's a gestation time before revenue. Was this largest ever MiR order a function of work prior done to the pivot? Or did it come after? And then to your point about being more immune to cycles, is that just because large accounts are more likely to invest through cycles and are less swayed by near-term conditions? \nGregory Smith: Yes. So let me take the large account question first. And I need to apologize to Brian because I didn't answer his question before. So the largest order that we've ever gotten from MiR, it came from an automotive customer. And it is also our historically largest customer for MiR. By no coincidence, it's also a significantly large customer for UR. So we have been selling them robots for a long time. The one thing that has happened since we established our large account effort is that we've been applying many of the strategic account management techniques that we've been using for decades in semiconductor test towards addressing those accounts and really organizing ourselves around the way that those large accounts acquire new equipment and also how to take care of the equipment that they have. So I think it's certainly an account that predated that effort, but I think our ability to serve that account has improved with this effort. \nSteve Barger: And then just about being more immune to cycles, is that because large accounts will invest through cycles? And so that pivot will make you less cyclical yourself? \nGregory Smith: I think actually, the large accounts may be the segment that has -- that will continue to be sensitive to end market conditions, because large accounts will work off of budgets. And if they don't provide budgets for automation, then those purchases won't happen. The thing that we're really trying to do is make sure that we are adding enough new opportunities to drive growth even if end market conditions are weak.  \n So a key part of this is being able to find and serve customers that have these problems. We have 95% of this market that is as yet unserved. So there is plenty of opportunity. And the key thing that we're trying to do is to pick our shots, pick the specific industry verticals and the specific applications that are likely to be driving growth independent of the aggregate macro conditions. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor over to Traci Tsuchiguchi for closing comments. \nTraci Tsuchiguchi: Great. Thank you all for joining us this morning for our first quarter earnings call. We look forward to being in touch with you all through the course of the quarter. Thank you. Good day. \nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Gregory Smith",
            "content": "Thanks, Traci. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us this morning. Today, I will summarize our first quarter results and discuss some of the trends in the semiconductor industry and robotics that we believe position Teradyne for long-term growth. It is useful to comprehend these longer-term growth drivers because the industries in which we operate are inherently cyclical. Sanjay will then provide greater financial detail on our first quarter results, our current outlook and additional financial information. \n We delivered first quarter financial results above our revenue, gross margin and earnings guidance ranges. Memory and SOC delivered above our plan and showed strong performance in the quarter driven primarily by AI applications. The impact of AI on our business was seen in networking as well as in Edge AI applications like ADAS. Over 40% of our memory shipments in the first quarter were driven by AI applications.  \n As we expected, mobile continued to be soft in the first quarter. Our robotics business delivered to planned for the third consecutive quarter as their go-to-market execution continues to improve.  \n Moving on to Q2. The impact of AI on test demand we experienced in the first quarter is continuing into the second quarter, improving our outlook in memory and in compute. However, a meaningful upturn in mobile, legacy auto and industrial end markets may not occur until the 2025 time frame.  \n Looking ahead, within the semiconductor test market, we expect that the compute TAM, which includes networking in many vertically integrated producers to grow at a faster pace than previously expected. We now estimate the compute TAM in 2024 to be $1.5 billion, up from $1.4 billion. We have lowered our TAM estimates for auto, industrial and mobile markets as recovery in these end markets appears to be pushing out in time. With the combination of our stronger first half and limited visibility into the second half, our estimate of the 2024 SOC TAM remains unchanged at $3.6 billion to $4.2 billion.  \n In memory test, we are increasing our expectation TAM growth to $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion from our prior estimate of $1 billion to $1.1 billion, driven mainly by stronger demand for HBM, which we expect to grow 5x last year's level. As I'm sure you've noticed, our first quarter results and second quarter expectations are significantly above our view from January. For the full year, at the company level, we continue to expect low single-digit growth from 2023. \n In January, we are expecting the year to be back half loaded with mobile driving that recovery. We also shared that lead times were decreasing and our visibility was limited. The sustained strength and new demand in AI-driven applications are boosting our business in the first half. However, we are being cautious on the second half on what looks like continued weakness in the mobile market. Our operations team is continuing to enable us to pursue short lead time opportunities, so it certainly feels as if there's more upside opportunity than downside risk.  \n Now turning to robotics. The first quarter is typically quite weak for our robotics business, and this year is no exception. We were very pleased to see the team deliver on plan and are expecting sequential growth in the second quarter. We are executing a plan which we expect to deliver 10% to 20% growth in 2024. This plan includes three elements: first is SAM expansion through new offerings. Second is growing our OEM solution provider in large account channels. Third is building increased recurring revenue through service and software offerings.  \n In the first quarter, we made good progress in all of these areas. We executed on new SAM expanding initiatives with the announcement of UR's collaboration with NVIDIA and the new MiR1200 pallet jack. We grew our UR OEM business 58% year-on-year, and we received the single largest order in the history of MiR from a strategic customer.  \n Zooming out, we see AI as the transformational secular growth driver across all of our businesses. AI applications are already having a profound impact on the test market, but we are in the very early days of the growth trend that will play out over the coming years. Today, the profit pool generated from AI is concentrated in the build-out of cloud AI capabilities, especially for training LLMs on huge data sets. \n The hardware requirements for training are massive and include general purpose fine grain compute, high bandwidth memory, dense network interconnection, and mammoth amounts of power, all of which are driving our business today. However, these LLMs will only deliver a business impact when they're used to solve problems in the real world. In other words, through inference applications, both in the cloud and at the edge. \n This is the key opportunity that is driving vertically integrated producers to develop their own devices and will materially affect the complexity of edge processors in automotive, industrial and mobile applications.  \n While our business is benefiting today from the considerable AI-driven growth in memory, networking and a few early ramps of vertically integrated producers, our greatest opportunity lies ahead as inference applications and edge AI accelerates because of our strong position with many of the leading providers of mobile and embedding computing in industrial and ADAS applications.  \n AI will also have a profound impact on the robotics industry. Teradyne Robotics is focused on collaborative applications, where robots need to work safely and efficiently in complex environments. AI provides an opportunity to more easily deploy robots that understand and adapt to their surroundings, making them more resilient and expanding the range of problems that they can address. With our layered approach to safety, high product quality and an open platform ecosystem, UR and MiR, are positioned as the preferred robotics platforms for the development of AI manufacturing and logistics solutions.  \n Last month, we announced a collaboration with NVIDIA to utilize their robotics stack on UR hardware and demonstrated the power of that collaboration at GTC with a visual inspection application. Also in the first quarter, we announced the MiR1200 pallet jack, a new AI-powered solution that uses 3D Vision to identify, pick up and deliver pallets even in dynamic and complex environments, making it a valuable resource for autonomous material handling in factories and warehouses.  \n Advanced robotics is just one of the many early examples of Edge AI applications positively impacting our business. Others include advanced driver assistance systems and AI capabilities being added to premium tier mobile handsets. Edge AI is becoming a material driver of TAM growth for Semi Test, but we're in very early days. We expect AI will be an overarching growth driver for years to come in test as a primary demand driver and in robotics as a key enabler of market growth. We're positioned to benefit from this megatrend, and we're investing R&D and field resources to capture this opportunity.  \n Summing up the quarter, we're off to a strong start with Q1 results and our outlook for Q2 well ahead of our view just 3 months ago. The strength and test is focused on cloud and edge AI applications, while other parts of the semiconductor industry work through inventory. Calling the end of these corrections is a challenge. So we're being cautious about our second half outlook. That said, our flexible operations model will enable us to serve upside demand. We expect that industrial, automotive and mobile will rebound from their current low levels and entirely new demand drivers like AI are already contributing to our Test business. The industry's increase in WFE spend in 2024 and 2025 will drive unit volume and device complexity growth, reinforcing our confidence in our midterm outlook.  \n And with that, I'll turn the call over to Sanjay. Sanjay? Mehdi, this is Greg. I think you've got it right that utilization is continuing to increase. The equipment that is in place is being used quite efficiently through the year. So the loading is relatively constant. And we definitely believe that it's a matter of when, not if there's going to be a need for significant additional capacity to support that kind of product line. Interesting question. Thinking about the TAM, that is the overall size of the market, so what we would get, what our competitor would get. And the size of the accelerator market has gone up a lot this year. Most of the testers to support this year's revenue in accelerators was put in place last year. So if the TAM that was supported last year supporting that sort of big growth that we've seen in the end market this year, what's going to happen this year, the $1.5 billion that we talked about is going to support a significant increase again next year. \n And this year, the primary beneficiary in terms of that end market is NVIDIA. What we're seeing now is that we are having some vertically integrated producers start to have significant ramps and they're already loading significant numbers of testers. The TAM in 2024 for compute is actually a little bit constrained below what it would otherwise be because these new entrants are actually able to work with their OSAT partners and convert idle testers that would have been in mobile into the compute space.  \n So right now, the loading of compute testers is higher than it was than what you'd see in terms of the buys in the market. As mobile starts to come back, that means that there's less idle capacity to fill. It also means that the compute market is going to be translated into more direct buys. Sure. So we are expecting to see some testers being used to support the engineering work in early parts in 2-nanometer probably towards the end of 2025. We don't expect any volume associated with 2-nanometer gate-all-around until 2026. And the way that we're looking at that right now is that there's nothing particularly idiosyncratic about that node in terms of tester demand.  \n So we're thinking of it primarily as an enabler to more complex parts. There are a lot of parts, for example, for cloud AI training that at this point are actually reticle limited, and so anything to allow increased complexity within the same die size is likely to be soaked up by AI. And so the faster that 2-nanometer comes online, the faster these more complex parts will be developed, and those will likely have longer test times, higher test intensity, which will drive the TAM. So in terms of competitive position, the share patterns that have existed for a few years are persisting. We have very high share in flash final test, we have strong share position in DRAM final test and we have a lower share position in both flat wafer sort and DRAM wafer sort. So what's happening in the memory market? Like last year, there was a lot of technology-driven buys that were pushing final test purchases. This year, the spark is coming back to the memory market, and that is driving the need for more capacity, and that is driving wafer sort purchases.  \n So there's no customer losses, but we are expecting to see our share come down a little bit this year as those wafer start capacity buys go in. Now the subtext underneath that is, HBM is a wafer-level technology, so all of the tests for HBM falls into that wafer sort space. And in HBM, last year, we had about 50% of the test TAM for HBM. This year, we're expecting that, that is going to come down modestly in terms of share. Our revenue is going to be up significantly, but the market is 5x bigger. So our share is probably going to float down a little bit as people begin to tool up next generation for the volume expansion in HBM.  \n At the same time, we think that our opportunities for share gain in terms of new test insertions for HBM are quite good. And so we're projecting that we're going to be penetrating new customers and new test steps for that this year. Well, from a vertically integrated producer perspective, it really kind of started back in like 2022, 2023. In 2024, like right now, there are hundreds of testers that are being used to test VIP source parts for us. And probably a similar number from our competitor. So it has happened. The thing that hasn't happened because of the -- the low utilization driven by the mobile slowdown, that hasn't translated into as much new tester purchases as we would have expected in a stronger market. \n But we have multiple VIP sockets that are loading more than 50 testers each, and we have a pipeline of new design starts that we are plan of record for that will stretch out all the way into 2026. So this is real. It's happening now, but the impact on our financial results has been muted by the low utilization because of the mobile downturn. So we have limited visibility, so just bear in mind that I'm going into the realm of speculation here. The things that could drive a higher second half is the leading edge of some sort of a recovery in mobile. Right now, we have a pretty low baseline baked into our plan. So essentially any capacity shortfalls would immediately turn into business.  \n And then the other is, we've seen such a dramatic strengthening in the Compute segment with very short lead times in Q1. So that's what really drove our increased outlook for Q2. So we didn't see it coming. We had hints that it was coming. We thought it would be further out and smaller. It has come in bigger and faster than we expected. If that trend were to continue, then we'd see continued strengthening in the compute space, and that's another thing that could drive a second half up.  \n The other way to think about that is we don't really think that industrial and automotive is going to significantly strengthen in the year. That's more of a 2025 thing. Yes. So that's a great question. We've been having very rich discussions internally about this to try and figure out when you consider a smartphone to be AI-enabled. And we're thinking about it in terms of the complexity of the processor that goes into the phone. There have been neural processing units and AI features in phones for years. But now, the AI opportunity, the edge AI opportunity is driving things towards pushing the amount of silicon area used for AI up towards like 50% or 1/3 of the silicon area going into that.  \n So those types of processors are just starting to hit the market now at the premium tier. And I think we've got about a year of people trying to figure out what kind of customer features will actually be compelling using that. And right now, there aren't that many of them. I think that, that's what's going to happen during the rest of 2024, that there's some premium smartphones and some people that are trying to innovate the things to do with them. I think the processer generation that's really going to start having enough power to do LLM stuff on a phone is probably the stuff that would ramp towards the end of 2025, and it would become much more mainstream in the generation of silicon coming out in '26. I hope I caught all of your question. If I didn't, then please correct me. We don't comment about specific customers. I will share that we don't expect that our historically largest customer will be a 10% customer this year. I'll also share that we think that there is more of -- that we've gotten sort of the bottom dialed into our plan, that there's definitely more upside to downside in terms of the plan associated with mobile in general. So I'll start off with sort of a qualitative answer in terms of the drivers, but then I'll pass it off to Sanjay to give you more of the precise split first half, second half and the profitability. So what's going on right now is we have a plan for the year that's going to be essentially sequentially growing quarter by quarter. And the reason that the plan is laid out that way is because there are new growth drivers that are coming online throughout the year. There are drivers that are in place from last year in Q1, that's specifically the UR20 and UR30, the heavy payload cobots.  \n In Q1, we had the announcement of the MiR1200 pallet jack. That's going to start really impacting revenue in the back half, primarily in the fourth quarter, but we're already taking orders. We're building backlog for that product. We also announced the collaboration with NVIDIA. That's going to really drive business through our OEM solution channel. So we're going to be providing the platform tools to that channel, so that they can create stuff that goes to market. So that's stuff that will also be back half loaded.  \n The other thing that's driving through the year is we are continuing to build our OEM channel and our large accounts channel. So those are things that we started. We started OEMs back in '22, we started large accounts in '23, and they have a significant amount of gestation time before they deliver revenue. We're right at the point where OEMs are starting to really click. We talked about the 58% year-on-year increase in that space. I'm expecting to see growth above the aggregate growth for large accounts in 2024. So that's going to be a growth driver through the end of the year.  \n So with that, I'll pass it off to Sanjay to give you sort of the precise breakdowns. Yes. So Krish, one quick comment. The 5x comment about HBM was referring to the market size for HBM memory. So last year was about $100 million of TAM for HBM. This year, we think it's about $500 million worth of TAM for HBM. Our revenue is not going to go up by a factor of 5. It's going to go up. It's going to go up significantly. But we're not going to be able to hold sort of the 50-ish percent share of HBM that we had last year. \n Are we over indexed to one customer? Well, the entire world is significantly over-indexed to one supplier in HBM. And that certainly has been driving our results to a great degree, both last year and will continue to drive our results this year. The other suppliers that are coming online. One of them is primarily internally based for test. We don't have any of that baked into our plan, although we think that they would be better off using our equipment, we haven't convinced them of that yet. And the other supplier in this space is a great customer of ours, although our share there is lower than our share in the leader in this space right now. So that's another reason that we expect to dilute our share a little bit this year.  \n The other point that I'll make is I was saying that we like our chances in terms of getting into new insertions for HBM memory this year. I think that, that's an important point. And we are hopeful that, that's going to be delivering significantly higher revenue for us through the midterm. This is Greg. Just one additional bit of color. If you think about the seasonality pattern that we developed really for a decade, 2010 through 2021, that seasonality, if you looked at all of our segments with the exception of mobile, there wasn't a really marked seasonality. Like those automotive, compute, industrial, they kind of chugged along. The seasonality was really driven by the mobile TAM, and that was driven by consumer buying behavior, right, that you needed to have things for the holiday season and for Lunar New Year. All of that inventory needed to be built up. And so there was a concentration of capacity that would go in, in Q2 and Q3, with mobile not driving right now, the seasonality is very, very muted. So I would expect to see that the seasonality will return once the mobile market is stronger, but I don't think you can use normal patterns to predict the way things will look in '24. Well, I think we certainly have optimism that it can get better. And that's basically because we've dialed in the bottom. And the way we do this is we typically will look at tester utilization numbers. And frankly, those numbers are all over the map. Some indicators show that capacity is tightening. Other indicators are showing that it's relatively -- utilization is tightening. Others show that it's relatively flat. Our qualitative checks, when we are talking to people in the ecosystem, they are telling us that capacity -- that utilization is getting tighter and it's forecast to go up from there. \n So the thing that, that hasn't done is it hasn't turned into firm forecast for additional business. And there is a fair amount of -- I think the lack of visibility that we see, it runs all the way through the supply chain that people are wondering what's going to happen. People are wondering how well handset sales will recover? And I think it's really going to come down to the way that the holiday season demand is shaping up. That's the thing that's going to be the lever that either turns on some additional spot buys or we'll have people waiting until 2025. Yes. So in terms of the TAM increase, we moved the TAM up by $200 million. And I think -- I think your guess of $40 million is a bit low. I think we'll be up a bit more than -- we'll get a larger chunk of that up than that, probably in line with our historical share level, kind of 35% to 40% of that TAM increase should probably go to us. In terms of lumpy sales, no, I think actually the memory business is driving -- we have deliveries that will be stretching out through the year. And I think the demand is relatively steady and potentially increasing. So I think on a quarterly basis, we don't expect a lot of memory variation. Okay. So in terms of the macro environment, it's pretty weak. I mean it was weak throughout 2023, and we don't see a significant improvement right now in terms of the end market conditions. If you look at PMIs, some regions are clicking up slightly, but we haven't really seen that turned into like a hot market. Having said that, we're in a part of the robotics market that is very, very low penetration. And so we are not -- we have seen our business results vary with the macro conditions, and we think that, that is indicative of the -- that was one of the things that drove us to go and make the changes in terms of adding new products and driving channel development, because we think we're 5% of the way into something that could be huge.  \n And if that's the case, then we should be somewhat immune to these cycles. But we've been looking at like industrial robot competitors and their results this quarter have been pretty meager. Like especially if you look at their incoming order rates, which is more comparable, they have long lead times. We have short lead times. So it's better for us to compare their orders to our orders. We feel like we are doing far better than they are in these end market conditions. But we're really focused on kind of controlling our own destiny by finding the things that need support even when the end market is [indiscernible].  \n One thing that I'll say is looking at other sort of industrial analyst notes and talking to people in that space, they are expecting improved strength like they think that things are going to get better, not worse. So I'm optimistic that we're going to have some macro tailwinds in addition to the plan that we baked, that's kind of counting on things staying around where they are. Yes. So for sure, the great thing about AI, there are two primary benefits to AI. One is that it's far easier to design a solution that is able to deal with variation, whether it's part variation or location variation or other uncertainties that exist in normal manufacturing environments, the solutions end up being far more resilient. So that means that more people would be willing to adopt them. \n People don't want to put fragile things into production and AI will help make things more robust. The simplicity of developing things is definitely a huge benefit of AI. So the demonstration that we did at GTC was a pretty sophisticated visual inspection application. And because we were leveraging a really powerful AI stack from NVIDIA, we were able to put that together in less than 2 weeks. It was a very fast turnaround to be able to build that solution. And we expect that both customers and customers and especially solution providers are going to be able to leverage that and create solutions to categories of problems that will help drive growth. Not really. Well, one thing is that most of the advanced packaging capacity in the world has been consumed by the people who are doing cloud AI, high-performance computing. So there's more demand than there is supply for it. So I think that's limiting it to the markets that are willing to pay the most for the ability to do it. I think that it's possible that chiplet technology will migrate out of high-performance computing potentially -- I mean it could potentially migrate into some mobile applications. I think that's going to be a relatively slow process because the price points are very, very different.  \n And then I think for industrial and automotive AI applications, it's likely to be a long time before you see chiplet technology in there because of the reliability and temperature range questions. It's a much more challenging environment to try and put packages. But that's kind of my view. I think that there are people that have a more aggressive view in terms of where chiplets will go. I think it's definitely the latter. So we believe we have a differentiated solution, both in terms of ability to support data rates out through HBM 4 and also in terms of being able to use same platform across multiple insertions. So we think that we have an ability to deliver more cost-effective performance test of HBM, and we believe that we're going to make some progress there. Yes. So let me take the large account question first. And I need to apologize to Brian because I didn't answer his question before. So the largest order that we've ever gotten from MiR, it came from an automotive customer. And it is also our historically largest customer for MiR. By no coincidence, it's also a significantly large customer for UR. So we have been selling them robots for a long time. The one thing that has happened since we established our large account effort is that we've been applying many of the strategic account management techniques that we've been using for decades in semiconductor test towards addressing those accounts and really organizing ourselves around the way that those large accounts acquire new equipment and also how to take care of the equipment that they have. So I think it's certainly an account that predated that effort, but I think our ability to serve that account has improved with this effort. I think actually, the large accounts may be the segment that has -- that will continue to be sensitive to end market conditions, because large accounts will work off of budgets. And if they don't provide budgets for automation, then those purchases won't happen. The thing that we're really trying to do is make sure that we are adding enough new opportunities to drive growth even if end market conditions are weak.  \n So a key part of this is being able to find and serve customers that have these problems. We have 95% of this market that is as yet unserved. So there is plenty of opportunity. And the key thing that we're trying to do is to pick our shots, pick the specific industry verticals and the specific applications that are likely to be driving growth independent of the aggregate macro conditions."

            "content": "Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll cover the financial summary of Q1, provide our Q2 outlook and full year planning assumptions. Now to Q1. First quarter sales were $600 million, which was $10 million above the high end of our guidance with non-GAAP EPS of $0.51, which was above the high end of our guidance of $0.38. Non-GAAP gross margins were 56.6%, above our guidance due to favorable product mix, higher volumes and improved operational efficiencies. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $251 million, both flat year-over-year and up slightly compared to our fourth quarter. Non-GAAP operating profit was approximately 15%. \n Turning to our revenue breakdown in Q1. Semi Test revenue for the quarter was $412 million, with SOC revenue contributing $302 million and memory, $110 million. In memory, our sales were strongest in DRAM as AI-driven demand remains strong. Test for HBM is being prioritized by our customers, and we are seeing customers transition capital spending for testers away from flash to DRAM, in part due to HBM and the return of capacity adds and other DRAM test.  \n Historically, we've seen split between flash and DRAM markets be more balanced. In System Test group, Q1 revenue was $75 million, with $23 million in storage test on low SLT and HDD demand. Recall, SLT has high exposure to the smartphone market. And even as HDD end markets begin to recover, tester capacity utilization rates remain low. In Wireless Test, revenue was $25 million in Q1, reflecting continued weakness in PC and mobile markets. In Q2, we expect wireless test to improve due to gaming end market and are now beginning to see the ramp of WiFi 7.  \n Now to robotics. Revenue was $88 million as planned with UR contributing $68 million and MiR, $20 million. Shifting to some cash metrics. At a company level, our free cash flow was an outflow of $37 million in the quarter. We typically consume cash in the first quarter as we pay taxes and variable employee compensation. We repurchased $22 million of shares in the quarter and paid $18 million in dividends. We ended the quarter with $871 million in cash and marketable securities.  \n Some other financial information in Q1. We had one 10% customer in the quarter. The tax rate, excluding discrete items for the fourth quarter was 15% on a GAAP basis and 15.5% on a non-GAAP basis. In Q1, we incurred an FX loss on the fair value of the currency exchange hedge related to the expected investment in Technoprobe. This drove a larger than typical variance between our GAAP and non-GAAP earnings in the quarter.  \n Turning to our current operational environment. In Semi Test, supply lead times continue to decline as supply versus demand is more in line. Our lead times continue to hold at 1 to 2 quarters. However, in some cases, we have been able to service demand inside these lead times. As a result, our customers are moving back towards historical buying patterns with shorter lead times, thus yielding lower second half 2024 visibility consistent with the pre-pandemic environment. Robotics remains a quick turns business and our execution continues to deliver to these market conditions.  \n Now turning to our outlook for Q2. Q2 sales are expected to be between $665 million and $725 million with non-GAAP EPS in a range of $0.64 to $0.84 and 162 million diluted shares. The second quarter guidance excludes the amortization of acquired intangibles and the anticipated gain on the expected sale of DIS, which is $0.29 in our GAAP forecast.  \n Some color around the forecasted increase to Q2 revenue versus our January view. The increase is driven by our Semi Test business where ADAS, compute networking and HBM demand has strengthened. As noted, this AI strength has continued into the second quarter and some orders initially scheduled for shipment in the third quarter have moved into the second quarter, improving our near-term outlook. Second quarter gross margins are estimated at 57% to 58%. OpEx is expected to run at 36% to 39% of second quarter sales, up modestly from Q1. Non-GAAP operating profit rate at the midpoint of our second quarter guidance is 20%.  \n A few points to assist you in modeling the rest of the year. I'll start with a few more details about the market estimates Greg provided. While our view of the SOC TAM is unchanged in total, under the cover, there are some puts and takes. Compute is up approximately $100 million, while mobile, auto and industrial are down a little over $100 million in aggregate. In anticipation of questions, let me provide the midpoint of our estimates by segment. Compute, $1.5 billion; mobile, $0.9 billion; auto MCU, $0.5 billion; Industrial, $0.3 billion; and service, $0.7 billion, summing up to $3.9 billion for SOC.  \n You'll notice the aggregate decline change has been allocated to the Industrial segment. Our memory estimate has increased $200 million with the midpoint of $1.25 billion. Please note, our final estimate for the 2023 SOC TAM is $4 billion, up $100 million in the Compute segment from our January view.  \n Back to revenue. We expect Q3 sales to be similar to Q2 and Q4 to improve from there. Note that our flattish sequential growth in Q3 does not assume any revenue from DIS. Excluding the impact of the anticipated divestiture, we would expect revenue to grow sequentially in Q3. Our expectation for revenue distribution for the full year is now less back half weighted than our view in January. We currently expect around 47% of the company revenue to be in the first half and 53% in the second half. We expect full year revenue to grow in the low single-digit range compared to 2023.  \n Now to gross margins. Gross margins are expected to continue to improve as we progress through the year and should be at our target gross margin model for the fourth quarter. Full year gross margins will likely be in the 58% to 59% range unchanged from our January outlook.  \n Regarding OpEx for the full year. We expect full year 2024 OpEx to grow 5% to 7%, consistent with prior guide as we continue to make engineering and go-to-market investments. Our GAAP and non-GAAP tax rate, excluding discrete items, are forecasted to be 15% to 15.5%, respectively, in 2024.  \n A quick update on our previously announced strategic partnership with Technoprobe. As a reminder, the agreement has several key components. First, Technoprobe will purchase Teradyne's DIS business, which provides advanced interfaces that connect our testers to customers' chips for test. Second, Teradyne will make an equity investment in Technoprobe, acquiring 10% of the company. Third, Teradyne and Technoprobe will work together on a series of projects to expand the performance of semiconductor device interfaces to enable customers to realize the full performance of our test systems. We continue to expect the transactions to close in the second quarter.  \n DIS revenue contribution for the first quarter was approximately $21 million. Post closing, our cash position will decline as the transaction is expected to consume an estimated $440 million of net cash. We will continue to limit our share buybacks in 2024 to an amount necessary to offset dilutions from equity compensation and our employee share purchase program in order to build cash back to a minimum goal of $800 million.  \n Summing up, we delivered sales and earnings above the high end of our guidance range as memory and networking exceeded our plan in Semi Test, mainly driven by AI. The mobile, industrial and legacy auto markets remain soft. Our robotics team delivered to plan for the third consecutive quarter, as we continue to execute our new product development and go-to-market strategies. Overall, visibility beyond the second quarter is limited, given the increased level of turns business in Semi Test. Our first quarter performance and the improvement in our second quarter outlook elevates our confidence for the year. Midterm fundamentals remain intact, yielding continued optimism beyond 2024.  \n With that, I'll turn the call back to Traci. Traci? Yes, it would, Mehdi. And if I could add just a quick comment. In my prepared remarks, we noted that the -- our estimate was revised for 2023 for the compute market. When I do the math of our midpoint of $1.5 billion in '24 versus our old, you do get a 15% increase, but we revised that in my prepared remarks, I noted to $1.4 billion. So I think the growth is 7% versus 15%. I just wanted to point that out. Sure. Why don't I take the numbers, and maybe the competitive position, Greg, if you want to take? So the range that we provided was $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, with the midpoint of $1.25 billion. And we think from a DRAM perspective, it's roughly 80% of that versus flash of 20%. Historically, I would say DRAM has been in the 40% and 50% of the overall memory market. So that's roughly the split. And then HBM we think is -- yes, we think that number is about $500 million. It's going to work upwards, but we think that number is above $500 million out of the $1.25 billion. So roughly the first half of the year -- well, first, as Greg noted, we expect to grow sequentially in Q2, and we expect to grow throughout the year for the reasons Greg just noted. But in the first half, we have 42%-ish plus or minus, and then 58% in the back half of the year. We do expect to be profitable this year. I would say, over the year, and I would say that, that would be single-digit profitability. I will comment, I think you asked about Q1. We were not profitable just given the seasonality of the quarter. That should give you the context, I think that you asked. I'll take the first one on the memory in the quarter. Yes. So I want to say roughly about 45% of the memory revenue that we had was tied in the first quarter to HBM. Yes. Interesting question. I'd say that I remember several years back when we talked about we were going into a downturn and that downturn was 4 to 6 quarters, and the downturn has gone a lot longer in the way of mobility. And as Greg noted, we believe that our forecast considers mobility at a point where we feel comfortable that it's going to be achieved. And so I think as things pick back up, the historical seasonality, I put it in the context of some segments are going to be recovering and we have some new segments that are -- or some segments that are growing fairly well. So I think the seasonality comment with regards to the test perspective, or test portfolio of businesses we have. It's a little bit off this year. Yes, I'll take the kind of the Q3 to Q2. It was, I'd say, mainly in compute and some ADAS that was accelerated and -- just looking up something."
