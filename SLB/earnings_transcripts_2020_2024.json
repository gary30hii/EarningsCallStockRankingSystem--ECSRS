Later, there will be an opportunity for your questions. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations ND Maduemezia. Please go ahead. \nND Maduemezia: Thanks, Lea. Good morning. And welcome to the Schlumberger Limited Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2020 Earnings Call. Today's call is being hosted from Houston, following the Schlumberger Limited Board meeting held earlier this week. Joining us on the call are Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Executive Officer; and Stephane Biguet, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind all participants that some of the statements we will be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially, from those projected, in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and our other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our fourth-quarter press release, which is on our website. With that, I will turn the call over to Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, ND. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us on the call. In my prepared remarks today, I will cover three topics, starting with our fourth quarter performance and my perspectives on what we accomplished in 2020. Thereafter, I will share our view of the 2021 outlook and the ambition we have set at the start of a new growth cycle. Stephane will then give more details on our financial results and we will open the floor to questions. First, let me start by thanking the women and men of Schlumberger for their resilience and outstanding performance in an exceptional year. The Schlumberger team significantly improved both, safety and service quality, two strong foundations of our performance strategy, despite COVID-19 adversity. In fact, this performance proved to be a critical differentiator for our customers, allowing us to strengthen our market position. This contributed to ending the year on a very strong note, and I am extremely proud of the results in the fourth quarter and our momentum headed into the New Year. In the fourth quarter, we delivered solid sequential revenue growth in both North America and the international markets and in all the four Divisions. We also recorded another quarter of sequential margin expansion, and cash flow from operation before severance was more than $1 billion. The recovery in the international markets and offshore, particularly deepwater, has commenced and was broad, with more than half of our international business units posting sequential growth, including most in MEA region. Our offshore long-cycle exposure and favorable positions in the short-cycle markets combined to deliver this peer-leading sequential international growth, ahead of rig activity. In North America, we posted strong double-digit revenue growth and sequential margin expansion, both onshore and offshore. Notably on land, our well construction and surface systems growth exceeded pressure pumping and outpaced rig count. This underscores the strength of our market position and breadth of services supporting shale activity and complementing our partnership with Liberty going forward. All-in-all, this was a very strong fourth quarter where we demonstrated the scale of our market exposure, the strength of our international franchise, the reset of our earnings power, and a very solid free cash flow conversion. Now, let me give you my perspective on what we had achieved last year. First, in line with our returns-focused strategy and as a response to the unique crisis, we restructured the Company globally, and in North America, we scaled to fit and high graded our portfolio. Internationally, we organized around key basins, addressed underperforming business units and contracts, and divested our Argentina APS asset. These actions have reset our operating leverage, and we exited 2020 with EBITDA margins restored to 2019 levels. Through 2021, we will build on this earnings power and visibly expand our margins. Second, we capitalized on growth drivers for the future, positioning our new Divisions ahead of the recovery cycle, aligned with our customers\u2019 workflows and key drivers in the new industry landscape, the digital transformation imperative, the mandate for sustainable and lower carbon operations, and the priorities for step change in Production & Recovery, maximizing reservoir performance, and well construction integration and efficiency. On digital, I am particularly proud of our achievements in 2020, both internally and externally. Through our industry digital platform strategy, we are enabling digital transformation at scale, unlocking significant value and leading innovation across the digital domain in our industry. This is further demonstrated by the highlights in our release this morning, which include enterprise-wide deployments, AI partnership, and expanding use cases of our digital platform. As a result, digital was the most resilient of our businesses during 2020, only second to subsea long-cycle, and is set to initiate an accretive growth cycle from 2021. Third, we launched Schlumberger New Energy to establish market positions and develop differentiated groundbreaking technology in multiple low or zero-carbon energy ventures. Our New Energy portfolio is very diverse and includes ventures in hydrogen, CCUS, lithium, geothermal, and geo-energy. As you have seen in this morning\u2019s earnings release, we announced significant progress with Celsius Energy and Genvia. In fact, we have made progress in every New Energy venture in 2020, enabling us to scale or to prepare entering commercial agreements for these ventures during 2021, an essential step in our clear ambition to position Schlumberger at the forefront of new and sustainable energy technology in the coming years. New Energy is a platform for long-term growth, and we will be making more announcements on these ventures over the coming weeks and months. Finally, last year, we accelerated our engagement with customers to provide solutions for the decarbonization of oil and gas operations and reinforced our commitment to improving our ESG performance. Specifically, we progressed on the adoption of both TCFD and SASB frameworks to increase the transparency of our environmental disclosures, resulting into the high-grading of our rating in the CDP Climate Change Program assessment to a peer-leading A minus. We also delivered a 15% reduction of our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions intensity within one year, well on our path to our stated 2025 emissions reduction goal. Now, I\u2019d like to share some of our views on the 2021 outlook. Absent of a new setback in the pandemic control and economic recovery, we see constructive macro drivers developing through the course of the year. In the near-term, disciplined OPEC+ supply actions are supporting oil prices well above crisis levels, while demand is projected to build up throughout the year. The exact magnitude and scale of demand inflection will be driven by the pace of global vaccine rollouts, easing of lockdowns, and coordinated economic stimulus through 2021. In North America, we anticipate continued momentum and a strong start to 2021 in land markets as activity continues to build up towards maintenance levels, both in well construction and completions. However, U.S. production will still be visibly below previous production levels, as continued capital discipline and the impacts of consolidations will cap the spending level, and rate of growth may slow in the second half due to budget exhaustion. As a consequence, we anticipate growth in NAM to be in the mid-teens when contrasted with the run-rate of the second half of 2020, excluding OneStim. In this scenario and as the market starts to rebalance, the call on international supply will increase, and we do expect to see an acceleration of the international recovery, both short and long-cycle, after the seasonal dip in the first quarter. Thus, in 2021 we anticipate the international activity to build up from the second quarter and in the second half of the year to exceed second half of 2020 by double digits. This macro backdrop is very favorable to Schlumberger both in North America and internationally. We expect all Divisions, including Reservoir Performance on a pro forma basis excluding OneStim to post full-year incremental growth compared to the second half of 2020 with the growth trajectory across the different Divisions shaped by the NAM-international mix and the relative exposure to short and long-cycle markets. Building on this combined NAM and international activity recovery, our new operating leverage will support a very significant EBITDA margin expansion in 2021 with an ambition to achieve 250 to 300 bps improvement versus full-year 2020, and consequently visibly above 2019 margins. In North America, this ambition will be supported by restoring double-digit margins in 2021 as a result of our strategic actions combined with the strength of our offering outside of pressure pumping and strong contribution from the offshore business unit. Internationally, with more than 80% of revenue coming from markets that will experience activity momentum, we see the combination of a favorable long and short-cycle mix, the breadth of our market exposure, and our unique fit-for-basin technology as key drivers for margin expansion throughout 2021. I will now pass on to Stephane to discuss our financial results in greater detail. Stephane?\nStephane Biguet: Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Fourth quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.22. This represents an increase of $0.06 sequentially and a decrease of $0.17 when compared to the same quarter of last year. Overall, our fourth-quarter revenue of $5.5 billion increased 5% sequentially. This revenue growth was equally driven by our North America and international businesses. The sequential international growth of 3% is especially notable, considering the seasonality effects we experienced in Russia in the fourth quarter. We indeed saw tangible signs of recovery in several key offshore markets. Companywide adjusted EBITDA margins for the fourth quarter increased 73 basis points sequentially to 20.1%, which is back to our full-year 2019 level. We have reached this milestone earlier than what we had previously committed to. This performance translated into sequential incremental EBITDA margin of 34%, which illustrates our improved operating leverage following the restructuring of the Company. During the fourth quarter, we completed two key previously announced transactions, the divestiture of our North America low-flow business and the contribution of our OneStim North America pressure pumping business to Liberty Oilfield Services. We look forward to working alongside Liberty to maximize the value of our partnership as the activity in North America land rebounds. As of year-end, we have completed more than 90% of our ongoing restructuring program that will permanently remove $1.5 billion of fixed cash costs on an annual basis. The early signs of recovery in the international offshore markets, combined with the high-grading of our North America portfolio and the near completion of our restructuring efforts, will all support strong margin expansion in the future as the industry recovery unfolds. In particular, we can count on the strength of our international business, which despite a very challenging macro backdrop in 2020, generated EBITDA margins of close to 24% on a full-year basis. These margins are set to improve going forward. Let me now go through the fourth quarter results for each division. Fourth quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $833 million increased 13% sequentially while margins increased 507 basis points to 32.4%. These increases were driven by strong APS results in Ecuador, as well as higher digital solutions and multi-client sales internationally. Reservoir Performance revenue of $1.2 billion increased 3% sequentially. This increase was driven by higher OneStim activity in North America. OneStim revenue during the fourth quarter of $274 million increased 25% sequentially. This increase was partially offset by seasonality in Russia and lower activity in the Middle East & Asia. Despite the improved North America revenue, margins decreased 84 basis points to 8%, largely driven by Russia. While OneStim\u2019s margins did improve in the fourth quarter, they were still highly dilutive to both our North America and our Reservoir Performance margins. In fact, our fourth quarter Reservoir Performance margins would have been approximately 400 basis points higher, excluding OneStim. Well Construction revenue of $1.9 billion increased 2% and margins increased 42 basis points to 10% due to increased activity in North America, Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East & Asia, partially offset by seasonality in Russia. Finally, Production Systems revenue of $1.6 billion increased 8% sequentially as international and North America revenues increased 7% and 11%, respectively. Margins increased 82 basis points to 9% due to higher revenue contribution from subsea and improved profitability in surface production systems. Now turning to our liquidity. During the quarter, we generated $878 million of cash flow from operations and $554 million of free cash flow, despite making $144 million of severance payments. Excluding the significant severance payments we made, our full-year 2020 free cash flow margin is very close to double-digits. This gives us the confidence that we will achieve our ambition of double-digit free cash flow margin in 2021, and in turn, begin deleveraging the balance sheet, which is a top priority for us. For the sake of clarity, this double-digit ambition includes the effects of changes in working capital as well as any severance. Our net debt improved sequentially by $46 million, despite an unfavorable currency impact of $223 million. Net debt at the end of the year was $13.9 billion, a year-on-year increase of $753 million. Approximately $600 million of this increase is due to changes in exchange rates that impacted our foreign currency denominated debt. These currency movements are fully hedged and therefore will not result into any incremental net cash outflow. During the quarter, we made capital investments of $324 million. This amount includes CapEx, investments in APS projects, and multi-client. For the full-year 2020, we spent $1.5 billion on capital investments. In line with our capital stewardship program, for 2021, we are expecting to spend between $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion on capital investments. The CapEx portion of these investments is expected to be towards the lower end of our previous guidance of 5% to 7% of revenue. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Stephane. I think, we are ready for taking the questions from all of you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nJames West: Hey. Good morning, guys. So, Olivier, international seems to me like it\u2019s accelerated maybe a bit faster than we had talked about previously. And it sounds like you\u2019re growing more optimistic on the outlook for the second half and certainly for \u201822 and \u201823, based on probably what you\u2019re seeing with tenders. And you guys have just a truly differentiated position in the international market. So, maybe could you touch on both, your differentiated position, but also kind of what you\u2019re seeing in terms of potential growth profiles over the next several years in international?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, James. So indeed, I think as you have seen, we reminded everyone that we will see -- we will have seen the trough for international markets in the third quarter, and we expect this to start to rebound in the fourth which is what we have delivered. This was against a rig count that actually went down, and I think we here used the breadth of our offering, both short and long-cycle, the exposure we have which is very broad, very diverse to offset some of the rig contraction in some part of the international markets and realize some gain, occasionally [ph] our market position to offset and realize what we have delivered. So, we believe that first and foremost, the breadth of our offering, short and long-cycle, our performance, which is acknowledged by customers and giving us opportunity to encroach or gain share when activity comes back are the fundamentals of our market position internationally. Finally, we believe that our technology offering, fit-for-basin technology, digital are unique attributes that customers recognize and are ready to allocate share to have access to this technology and to leverage and to gain efficiency going forward. So, when you look now going forward on the long-term outlook, we have indeed -- we see that the market will accelerate beyond the inflection point that we see in the first quarter. That is a seasonal dip. And then we expect and anticipate that we could reach or exceed double digits on H2 to H2 on an exit-to-exit growth rate. And then, we anticipate that this will continue and even be strengthening in \u201822 and \u201823.\nJames West: Right. Okay, very good. And then, Olivier, a big uptick in -- a big surge in digital margins sequentially, is that something that -- is that kind of market profile expected to continue or is that kind of a blow off the top fourth quarter sales and things like that, and it might moderate going forward? I mean it\u2019s already a really high-margin business and a great business for you guys, but how should we think about that margin profile going forward?\nOlivier Le Peuch: No. First, I think, let me comment briefly on the fourth quarter results. Indeed, the fourth quarter result of the Digital & Integration division was a combination of very strong APS execution, multi-client sales that came from the seasonal effect of multi-client sales during the fourth quarter and international sales and success in our digital business. Going forward, we see beyond this exceptional performance. We still are confident that we\u2019ll be able to maintain on a full year basis the 30% or so margins for the division of integration and digital going forward.\nOperator: And next, we have a question from David Anderson from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nDavid Anderson: Hi. Good morning, Olivier. So, sort of a slight difference from the way James kind of asked the question on the international side. So, if we think that 2023, we\u2019re going to see global oil demand largely recover, just kind curious how you see the cadence of the different international markets? Each market is a little bit different. I\u2019m just wondering how you see -- which ones do you think come up first, which ones come back a little bit later? Could you just sort of maybe just provide a little color around the different regions as you see it from here?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think, it\u2019s difficult to decipher this or to bring granularity out to 2023 on how the market will recover per region. But globally speaking, I think, there will be an element of short and long cycle. So, we believe first that the region that were the most impacted and Latin America is one, will have recovery growth that will come maybe first because it\u2019s a combination of short and long cycle. We believe that the short cycle that exists in Middle East would favor that region both in short and midterm. We believe that Russia and Asia as well will benefit. And we believe that later in the cycle, from the second half of this year and later, the offshore market at large will start to benefit from long growth, but I think it\u2019s very difficult to give a granular view of this. I think the short-cycle will benefit from sometime later this year, and the long cycle will be accelerating, we believe, in \u201822 and \u201823.\nDavid Anderson: Okay, understood. And on the digital side, you talked about digital being a core part of your growth strategy in the next couple of years. You talked about digital solutions and software increased internationally. I\u2019m just curious as to what type of demand pull you\u2019re getting from customers? Is this further penetration of DELFI in terms of getting the platform to customers or is this new applications? You had mentioned a number of countries in which I do normally think about in terms of digital adoption, Russia, Scandinavia, and the like. Can you just kind of talk about what that customer pull is these days on digital, and maybe how you think that could evolve over the next couple of years?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Very good question, Dave. I think, the pull is multi-faceted, I would say. There is pull from customers that are willing to step change the efficiency of their own workflows and hence gain productivity into their planning, field development, and evaluation of reservoir potential. And this is creating a pull for our workflow solutions with customers, which -- where we\u2019re building on our desktop solution and then creating a transition to the cloud to gain scalability, productivity, and collaboration. So, that\u2019s the first pull. The second pull is around unlocking the data. Customers are looking at ways to extract more value from the data that they own. And hence, they are looking for exploiting AI/ML tools that the industry can provide them. For this, there is this OSDU platform that the industry has adopted for which we contributed ourselves, the design of this ecosystem, and we are getting customers to pull us, and you have seen one example into our release this morning with AIQ in Middle East where the goal is to create AI solution for -- and with ADNOC and with Group 42 to deploy in the cloud in the region for ADNOC to benefit for this data insight. And finally, we see customers pulling into digital operation and trying to create step change into the way they execute their drilling, well construction or the existing extracting efficiency from their existing assets. So, these are the three pulls we see, and we have offerings that correspond to each. And you have seen that the OMV announcement this morning is mostly on the first and the second, on the workflows and the data, and you have seen some announcement we did last quarter and this quarter onto the digital operation. So, we see customers in all regions having an interest into expanding from the desktop to the cloud for their workflow, unlocking the value of that data through the cloud and through new digital solutions, including OSDU, and reaching out to operation and unlocking through edge application, the automation and application of AI to operation. So, we see this across multiple regions and all the customer type.\nOperator: And our next question is from the line of Angie Sedita with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAngie Sedita: So, nice to see the strong incremental margins in Q4 with really digital being an impressive contributor. Also appreciate the guidance around margins for \u201821. I thought you said 250 to 300 basis-point margin expansion in \u201821 versus \u201820 I believe is the comment. And maybe you could just discuss that or pull that apart a little bit on the biggest drivers of this expansion, is it digital predominantly or other divisions, and maybe thoughts across the divisions as far as margins? And then, around North American margins, timing of when you think potentially you could reach that double-digit level?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yes. Good question, Angie. Let me bring clarification back on what we said this morning in the prepared remarks. So, ambition for 2021 is to expand margin by 250 to 300 bps or higher, if the market conditions allow us, between 2021 and full-year 2020. And this will exceed vis-\u00e0-vis the 2019 margins on a full year basis. So, we see this will be driven by three factors. First, the full benefit of our restructuring efforts where we have realized at the end of 2020 more than 90% of our 1.5 permanent structural cost reduction; secondly, the impact of our portfolio high-grading in North America that will actually allow us in the current market condition to reach or exceed double digit in North America in 2021; and finally, from the incremental margins from our international franchise, where we expect the combination of efficiency measure, including digital, digital operation for our own operation, the combination of the firewall market mix, if I may, and the strength for fit-for-basin technology to differentiate and give us the edge and hence, the growth of our margin internationally. So, when you combine all of this, this will give us this margin -- visible margin expansion year-on-year of 250 to 300 bps or above visibly the 2019, despite being significantly down on top-line. So, Division per Division, we anticipate actually, from the run rate of -- for the full year, we expect all Division to actually expand margins on a full year basis. And I think this is not only digital. I think, Reservoir Performance by the exit of OneStim we\u2019ll, as Stephane did comment in his prepared remarks, get the benefit from that as a margin mix and will further expand, Well Construction due to efficiency and market growth we\u2019ll also get benefits on incremental. And production and digital, as I commented before, will establish itself at a high 20% or 30% margin for the full year. So, I hope it does clarify for you the margin mix and rationale and the drivers for this expansion.\nAngie Sedita: No, that\u2019s very helpful. I really appreciate the detail, Olivier. So, maybe we could talk a little bit about New Energy. Obviously, you have a lot of initiatives that are currently announced and apparently more to come. But, maybe you could specifically talk about the Genvia and hydrogen and the opportunity around electrolyzer and then geothermal energy and maybe the timeline and where the biggest opportunity set is amongst the two.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Okay. So, I\u2019m not sure that I will have -- I will take the time to comment on each and every one of these. So, let me comment briefly on the Genvia. So, indeed, Genvia is a venture we have created with partners, including research arms of the -- in France to indeed industrialize, commercialize solid-oxide electrolyzer technology that is set to be changing a bit the usual efficiency of this electrolyzer use for green hydrogen production. The market towards 2030, to give you a sense, is expected to be about 70 gigawatts of installed capacity of electrolyzer that needs to be installed in the world globally. We\u2019ve obviously ambition to be participating into that market and create and capture share of that market through our solution. Our solution will be to deliver this electrolyzer capacity to the market, sometimes used in -- for reversibility in fuel cells, and most of the time used to produce hydrogen. So, ambition indeed is to develop this across the next few years. Our milestones, speaking about this, will be to technically demonstrate this in the coming quarters and deliver some prototypes to our partners that will use it in fuel cell or in hydrogen production. And from that point on, in the next two or three years, make a decision, a critical decision to build and expand into large-scale manufacturing to respond and take share into this market. So, each of these ventures that we are entering into is using the same multi-steps approach where we invest in technology, we test the market with partners, and we then derisk, commercialize and ready ourselves for scale. So, that\u2019s the approach we are having, not entering into large capital-intensive project, but leveraging our domain, subsurface domain expertise that is very applicable for CCS, very applicable for geothermal, leveraging our technology, industrialization capability that is very applicable for all of this venture, and finally, leveraging our global footprint so that we can work with partners everywhere in the world and respond to the energy transition on a global basis.\nOperator: Our next question is from Scott Gruber from Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nScott Gruber: So, I wanted to come back to the international recovery question and ask it a slightly different way. When I think about the U.S., the U.S. has transitioned from gross mode, to call it, maintenance plus mode. But, when I think about the rest of the world, most markets abroad were closer to that maintenance mode pre-pandemic with a few exceptions in there. But Olivier, how do you think about what this means for recovery potential on a multiyear basis? Over the next few years, how close could the activity set abroad get to the pre-pandemic level just given kind of the starting point where we were kind of from more of a maintenance mode in many of these countries pre-pandemic?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yes. Thank you, Scott. I think, if we assume and take the hypothesis that the market indeed will converge towards maintenance mode in the U.S., we have to remember that through this crisis, the U.S. production has gone down by 2 million barrel. And if we assume that the next two or three years will not give us the activity, intensity and investment to recover this 2 million barrel, what will happen is that this 2 million barrel will have to be supplied internationally. Hence, the market share of supply will change in favor of international market. When you equate this and assume that the oil demand will go back to the 2019 level by 2023, and some are predicting earlier by 2022, I think, this will create the condition to -- for the budget spend internationally to actually match the 2019 by the 2023, 2025 latest horizon. Hence, it matches our hypothesis that we can return EBITDA of 2019 in the period of 2023 to 2025 as we\u2019ll benefit from this market rebound international from now to 2023. So, that\u2019s our hypothesis going forward is that the market supply share will rebalance slightly, will favor international and will, as a consequence, pull international activity to 100% or more in the next two or three years.\nScott Gruber: That makes a lot of sense. And maybe just a little bit of color on working capital in \u201821, should be somewhat of a headwind, not necessarily a bad thing as it reflects demand recovery. But just how should we think about it, either in terms of an aggregate number or on an intensity basis, if you want to give us some color on days outstanding for the key items?\nStephane Biguet: Scott, I\u2019ll take this, -- Stephane. If you look at 2020 actually, our cash flows only benefited from a very modest working capital release. So, conversely, if you look at growth in 2021, we don\u2019t see a big working capital increase. There will be some as activity grows, but our working capital intensity is not that high. So, we will try to keep this to a minimum. And at the same time, we will benefit from the full-year effects of our cost-out program, which are all cost savings and the discipline on CapEx. So, we don\u2019t see working cap as a big headwind. We will be able to offset this with the underlying cash flow performance and get, for sure, to this double-digit free cash flow margin within the -- in 2021.\nOperator: And our next question is from Sean Meakim with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nSean Meakim: So, back to D&I margins, if you don\u2019t mind. A lot of moving parts here in 2020 given what happened in Ecuador. You touched on some of the drivers of the sequential improvement in 4Q. It was also up 900 basis points year-on-year. So, could you maybe just unpack which of the drivers were the biggest components of that delta? Was it digital? Was it APS efficiencies and streamlining? I was just asking for help in squaring the difference between historicals and now the expected plus 30% trajectory going forward.\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think, it\u2019s a mix of both. I think, you pointed out to the components. I think, we expect going forward that the contribution of EPS operating at -- with very strong performance. We have improved our performance significantly in that -- in this. We are increasing back the digital as a component of this going forward. We expect contribution of this maintaining EPS performance to the level that we have seen in the last two quarters. We divested some investment in APS as well. That has helped us improve the margin of APS. And the future growth, anticipated growth and margin accretion from digital will combine to maintain this at the level that I mentioned here, the high-20s or 30s.\nSean Meakim: And if we just think about the drivers of the 250 to 300 basis points of improvement in margin year-on-year in \u201821, how much will be attributed to pulling out OneStim, and then divestments and just year-on-year improvement of, let\u2019s say, a full year of production in Ecuador, so that\u2019s the impact of APS. If we take those two components out, how much enhancement is there for the rest of the portfolio? I know that may not be a calculation you have necessarily offhand. But trying to think about, aside from those two big items, trying to see how much of the rest of the portfolio is improving on a margin basis, thanks to the rest of the cost efforts.\nStephane Biguet: So, Sean, actually, the few items you mentioned, they do of course help the margin. But, when you look at the global margin, taken together, those three items are not that material. So, the margin tailwind is mostly from the cost-out program actually, optimizing and resetting our earnings power. And from the incrementals on the international activity and the mix you\u2019ve seen on our international margins, even on a full-year \u201820 basis, which was not the best, the best are pretty high. So, most of the margin expansion come from there and cost-out program with a little bit of help from the factors you mentioned, on a global basis.\nOperator: Next we go to Kurt Hallead with RBC. Please go ahead.\nKurt Hallead: Thank you for all the color so far. So, Olivier, the question I have for follow-up is again on the international front, since it\u2019s a major point of emphasis. It seems like your commentary with respect to the offshore recovery is notable in the context that other peers didn\u2019t really explicitly referenced that. So, two things. I\u2019m kind of curious as to what you are seeing from the customer base that\u2019s giving you that level of conviction to specifically highlight that? And then, second, given the fact that your peers haven\u2019t really explicitly stated it, it would lead, at least me to believe that you have some unique opportunities that your peers may not.\nOlivier Le Peuch: No. Thank you. I think, let me first comment on the actual results. And I think the actual results indeed, if you look at the very specific country, the very specific basin where we have growth to sort of the GeoUnits, as we call them, that had growth in the fourth quarter sequentially, where offshore GeoUnits from Guyana to Brazil, from the other around the world where we had -- and West Africa, did grow. So, that is a fact. And indeed, we can attribute this to market position and our market share that we have and benefit from in those markets clearly. And I think we had even a couple of them, including Guyana that were year-on-year growing from Q4 2019. So, we had some indeed traction into these. And I think that came from the market that did rebound in deepwater. Deepwater was in Q4 higher than in Q3 in term of actual rig count. It was offset by some other rig activity going down or slowing down in the fourth quarter. But, I think the offshore deepwater specifically was up. Now, going forward, we don\u2019t see a setback to that trend. And aside from the deep seasonal effect into the first quarter, we see that this will grow going forward. If we look at our projection, deepwater is actually a gain. The rig that will benefit the most in 2021 going forward into the teens in term of year-on-year projection by contrast with shallow that will only see single-digit as well as land. So, when you combine all of this, that give us the -- our market position established and demonstrated during the fourth quarter. And our anticipated rebound for long-cycle that we see in the contract out there for the deepwater give us the confidence that offshore will contribute meaningfully to our international rebound in second half.\nKurt Hallead: Okay. That\u2019s great. That\u2019s great color. And then, my follow-up is going to be on the New Energy front. You were very informative about the things that you have going on right now. I\u2019m kind of curious, right, as investors look at opportunities to participate in the energy transition and companies like yourselves look to participate in that energy transition, I just wondering if you can give us some general sense as to what you think the total addressable market could be for the services and technology and the partnerships that you are currently involved in, say, over the course of the next three to five years? Any insights on that would be really helpful.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yes. I think, I will -- to give granular view per venture, I think, we will give ourselves the next few weeks and months to prepare communication to all of you on that front. And for sure, before the mid-year, I think, we will come with a much better view for all of you on where we participate. But needless to say, that each and every one of the ventures we participate has a very significant potential on total addressable market. I think, we are here having the ambition a create a Division that will supplement the four Divisions that we currently have within the decade. And we believe that the market for each of hydrogen, CCUS, geothermal, geo-energy or lithium, is very significant. So, I don\u2019t want to go into any detail. But, I think I just mentioned and give you the example of the 70-gigawatt of electrolyzer capacity that will have to be installed within the next 10 years. That gives you a sense of what is happening. There will be 800 million tons of CCS that will have to be captured between now and the end of the decade in projects that will work with emitters to create conditions to capture and sequestrate this carbon, and lithium oxide as well for the high-density battery will grow significantly in the decade to come. So, each and every of this venture has a unique and fast-growing TAM. Now, the reason why we are maybe unique in our position into this. First, we have a domain that is relevant in experience into this, particularly in CCS and in geothermal. Second, I think, we have a track record of industrialization and development of technology at scale. And third, I think, we know how to partner and deliver technology and deploy technology and solution everywhere in the world with any partners. And you will see announcement coming in the next few weeks and few months as we\u2019ll illustrate that at scale.\nOperator: And our next question is from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nChase Mulvehill: I guess, if we could kind of talk about 1Q a little bit, and kind of maybe give us some color, maybe directionally, or if you want to quantify maybe what you think kind of North America revenues would be up or down if you back out OneStim? And then, maybe some color around international revenues, and then, maybe the margin progression. Obviously, you\u2019re pulling out OneStim, but then you put in the equity income from Liberty, so just trying to help us maybe directionally on EBIT margins as well.\nStephane Biguet: So, if I understand your question correctly, Chase, you are asking for the first quarter, some colors on the first quarter. I think, we have mentioned in our prepared remarks and in our earnings release that we anticipate after a strong quarter, the usual seasonal dip, partly international market. We see that every year, and we have seen it for the last 10 years. We don\u2019t see it different this year. I think, we don\u2019t see it as a pronounced dip. But we see it at a usual, what we say, seasonal effect that we see affecting Russia, affecting some of the China or offshore market in the first quarter. When it comes to North America, I will again differentiate between offshore, that will transition from a quarter where we delivered some subsea and some multi-client, significant impact on the third quarter -- on the fourth quarter from -- into the first quarter. Whereas in the land market activity, as we mentioned, we foresee a continuity of activity pickup that will transition from the growth rate we have seen in the last part of last year, and that will continue. And we see this growing at the same rate, both on rig and on completion activity.\nChase Mulvehill: Okay. And then on the margin side, as you pull OneStim out, do you think that margins can hold flat or be higher on a quarter-over-quarter basis?\nStephane Biguet: The margin there will see the -- on the revenue dips, you will have, of course, a bit of decremental. But it will not be as pronounced as we have normally indeed because of the OneStim effect going into Q1, particularly for NAM. So, the NAM margin of course will not decrease. And overall, we should be able to maintain overall the same level of margin.\nChase Mulvehill: Okay. And then, pre-COVID, you were talking about divestitures. You were working on land rigs. And then you messaged that APS in Canada would be entertained over the medium term. So, now that macro conditions are getting a little bit better, could you kind of update us on your view on some of these divestitures?\nStephane Biguet: We are, of course, pretty much still working on these fronts and other. On the rigs, we have -- we are still looking at transactions in Australia. And then, in the Middle East, we have some progress there, but nothing to disclose at this stage. It\u2019s a bit of a different format than what we had looked at before, but it\u2019s still on the books. Regarding Canada, our APS project there, called Palliser, the macro environment is indeed getting quite better when looking at this asset. And we are -- we have a lot of interest building up. So, we think there is value to be extracted there. And I think, we\u2019ll be in a position even probably to launch a formal process sometime in the next few months. So, lots of interest in Canada and hopefully, it will result into something good happening this year.\nOperator: Our next question is from Marc Bianchi with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nMarc Bianchi: Maybe just circling back to the line of questioning around the first quarter. A lot of moving pieces with OneStim and such. Could you maybe comment on how you see first quarter shaping up relative to consensus? I see EBITDA of about $1 billion right now for consensus.\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think we -- as we said, I think we see the seasonal impact affecting international. We see the effect and positive effect of the non-effect on OneStim. And overall, I think we looked at the full year more than the first quarter. We are confident that the margin from operating margin will be steady as we transition the first quarter despite a minimum dip from seasonal effect, international, offset partially by North America.\nMarc Bianchi: Okay. Thanks for that, Olivier. The other thing that struck me was CapEx. So, you mentioned the CapEx would be at the low end of the 5% to 7% range, but on an absolute basis, the midpoint is up a bit, but your overall revenue is down a bit. I understand there is APS and multi-client. Maybe you could break those out for us and expand a little bit more on how you see CapEx shaping up over the course of the year.\nStephane Biguet: Sure. So really, as a reminder, we are really looking at the capital investments altogether, right, the CapEx portion, as you mentioned, APS and multi-client. And there, in 2020, we spent $1.5 billion. It was quite a reduction from 2019, a 45% reduction, more than what the revenue reduced actually, so the intensity reduced in 2020. So, we start from a very low base. We may maintain it around the $1.5 billion, but we want to leave ourselves a little bit of room to capture the growth we are starting to see, particularly in the international market. We want to be ready to deploy CapEx in the most lucrative markets, and we don\u2019t want to miss the opportunity. So, we will monitor and modulate accordingly, but we will stay within the $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion. As it relates to CapEx only, yes, I think, it will be closer to 5% with the current equipment, the capacity we have and the capital efficiencies we have realized. But we leave a bit of flexibility. We\u2019ll monitor, but we\u2019ll stay within the range we stated for total capital investments.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yes. We will continue exert capital discipline, as you know. So, we\u2019ll make -- we want to give ourselves optionality, hence, our guidance. But we\u2019ll keep agility and extracting efficiency from our existing fleet to make sure we minimize the capital spend going forward. And we are here We are indeed very firm on to our being on the low end of our 5% to 7% for the CapEx aspect of our capital.\nOperator: And our next question is from Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nConnor Lynagh: Yes. Thanks. I kind of wanted to return to the digital integration business a little bit. So, hey, very much appreciated that you disclosed the value of the OMV contract, I think a lot of people are trying to figure out how to think about the market for this business. I guess, what I\u2019m wondering if you could frame is, given that size of the contract, is this a small contract relative to the opportunities that you\u2019re looking at? Is it mid-sized contract? Is it a large contract? How should we think about if you continue to expand your customer base, how that can roll through? And then, are there additional [Technical Difficulty]\nOlivier Le Peuch: Go ahead. Go ahead, sorry. We got an interruption here. Go ahead, please, Connor.\nConnor Lynagh: Yes. I\u2019m sorry. Can you hear me now?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yes, we could hear you until this point. Go ahead.\nConnor Lynagh: Okay. Thank you. So basically, the question is, can you frame the size of the OMV contract? I\u2019m curious, relative to the size that you\u2019ve disclosed there, how significant is this contract relative to the opportunities that you\u2019re looking at? And can you help us understand the life cycle of a typical contract with a customer in Digital & Integration? Is this a relationship that evolves and grows over time? And can you quantify maybe how significant that opportunity could be?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Great question, Connor. I think, obviously, we are very proud of this large enterprise deployment contract that we have earned with OMV, and we will work with them over the next few quarters to roll out our solution and create unique AI workloads that will accelerate and step change their positive efficiency for their own operation. But, this -- I think, to realize that this is a large contract is just also to compare the scale of some of our customers we\u2019re working for. The contract size can be much more significant than the one we have just announced. So, I think, the rates and the range of contract we\u2019ll -- we are engaged with our customers is very broad from customers that are willing to get access on demand to some simulation compute, or the customers are willing to do a full transition of all of their workflows, data and enterprise solution to the cloud, similar to what OMV is engaging with us is a broad portfolio of what we are engaging with customers. So, to give you an example, I don\u2019t think there is more than -- there is many more than one example, and it will go from single million dollar investment to a large multi-hundred million dollar over long-term contract. So, the typical engagement includes a transition engagement that will transition the data, transition the workflows, and then includes a transition to the SaaS model, Software-as-a-Service, or Data-as-a-Service for the long run. So, these typical contracts are 5 or 10 years and include a transition and then an exploitation part of the contract.\nConnor Lynagh: That\u2019s very helpful. And I guess, maybe you could help us understand, I think, typically, these types of contracts have maybe relatively breakeven or at least lower margin profiles at the beginning and then expand over time. Should we think about that for you guys? I mean, if we\u2019re in sort of early days for some of these digital initiatives, is there a margin tailwind that we should expect?\nOlivier Le Peuch: No, I will not comment that way. I think, it depends on every contract on the commercial condition we negotiate with the customer. There is always obviously a technology investment that we have been doing for the last five years. And we continue to invest in technology. And every project and every commercial engagement is different. So, it\u2019s very difficult to make any projection or any trends. I believe that we gave a little bit of indication of the highly accretive margins, and we believe that this is true and holding true for the entire portfolio we have and would not want to comment project or contract by contract.\nConnor Lynagh: Okay, okay, understood. Maybe just to sneak one more in here. Just to continue to enhance your digital initiatives, do you feel that you need to step up your capital expenditure or your research and development at this point to achieve some of the goals that you\u2019ve laid out, specifically the doubling of that business over time?\nOlivier Le Peuch: No, we believe that we have created a very significant investment in the last five years when we created a foundation of this DELFI, Agora, OSDU foundation. We are working with partners to augment the capability of this foundation as per the announcement we made with IBM and the collaboration we have with Google and Microsoft. And we\u2019ll continue to work with partners, continue to spend and allocate a large portion of our engineering effort into this. And we believe that we are well covered to create the growth pattern that we have announced going forward.\nConnor Lynagh: Thanks very much.\nOlivier Le Peuch: You\u2019re welcome, Connor. So, I believe that it\u2019s time to start to close. I think we are running out of time at the clock. So, thank you, everyone. And I think to conclude, I would like to offer three takeaways. First, the strength of our results during the first quarter-- the last quarter, built on a very broad performance improvement across divisions, both in North America and internationally, speaks volumes about our market positioning and the effectiveness of our strategic execution during the year. We are starting 2021 from a position of strength, having reset our earnings power and return potential. Second, with a gradual return of demand throughout 2021, we anticipate North America activity to continue consolidating towards sustaining production, and international activity rebounds to broaden and accelerate in the second half. This aligns very well with the evolution of our portfolio in North America and with our established international market positions and should lead all Divisions to post incremental growth in 2021 when contrasted to the second half of 2020, and for the company to expand full-year margins significantly above 2020 and visibly ahead of 2019. Third, our strategic execution has created a platform to capitalize on growth drivers in the new landscape, as we witnessed the beginning of a new chapter in our industry, a chapter where digital is an imperative for industry efficiency; a chapter where innovation and technology will impact field development, asset performance, and production & recovery; and a chapter where industry resilience will be defined by sustainability and lower carbon footprint. We are prioritizing our investment towards these growth drivers and at the same time, will continue to accelerate our expansion into New Energy venture to prepare for the future. Ladies and gentlemen, we are reinventing ourselves and are delivering financial results ahead of our stated ambition. Our company is on a new performance journey with attractive, yet resilient return, and very exciting growth prospects in and beyond our core industry. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T TeleConference Service. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Stephane Biguet",
            "content": "Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Fourth quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.22. This represents an increase of $0.06 sequentially and a decrease of $0.17 when compared to the same quarter of last year. Overall, our fourth-quarter revenue of $5.5 billion increased 5% sequentially. This revenue growth was equally driven by our North America and international businesses. The sequential international growth of 3% is especially notable, considering the seasonality effects we experienced in Russia in the fourth quarter. We indeed saw tangible signs of recovery in several key offshore markets. Companywide adjusted EBITDA margins for the fourth quarter increased 73 basis points sequentially to 20.1%, which is back to our full-year 2019 level. We have reached this milestone earlier than what we had previously committed to. This performance translated into sequential incremental EBITDA margin of 34%, which illustrates our improved operating leverage following the restructuring of the Company. During the fourth quarter, we completed two key previously announced transactions, the divestiture of our North America low-flow business and the contribution of our OneStim North America pressure pumping business to Liberty Oilfield Services. We look forward to working alongside Liberty to maximize the value of our partnership as the activity in North America land rebounds. As of year-end, we have completed more than 90% of our ongoing restructuring program that will permanently remove $1.5 billion of fixed cash costs on an annual basis. The early signs of recovery in the international offshore markets, combined with the high-grading of our North America portfolio and the near completion of our restructuring efforts, will all support strong margin expansion in the future as the industry recovery unfolds. In particular, we can count on the strength of our international business, which despite a very challenging macro backdrop in 2020, generated EBITDA margins of close to 24% on a full-year basis. These margins are set to improve going forward. Let me now go through the fourth quarter results for each division. Fourth quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $833 million increased 13% sequentially while margins increased 507 basis points to 32.4%. These increases were driven by strong APS results in Ecuador, as well as higher digital solutions and multi-client sales internationally. Reservoir Performance revenue of $1.2 billion increased 3% sequentially. This increase was driven by higher OneStim activity in North America. OneStim revenue during the fourth quarter of $274 million increased 25% sequentially. This increase was partially offset by seasonality in Russia and lower activity in the Middle East & Asia. Despite the improved North America revenue, margins decreased 84 basis points to 8%, largely driven by Russia. While OneStim's margins did improve in the fourth quarter, they were still highly dilutive to both our North America and our Reservoir Performance margins. In fact, our fourth quarter Reservoir Performance margins would have been approximately 400 basis points higher, excluding OneStim. Well Construction revenue of $1.9 billion increased 2% and margins increased 42 basis points to 10% due to increased activity in North America, Latin America, Africa, and the Middle East & Asia, partially offset by seasonality in Russia. Finally, Production Systems revenue of $1.6 billion increased 8% sequentially as international and North America revenues increased 7% and 11%, respectively. Margins increased 82 basis points to 9% due to higher revenue contribution from subsea and improved profitability in surface production systems. Now turning to our liquidity. During the quarter, we generated $878 million of cash flow from operations and $554 million of free cash flow, despite making $144 million of severance payments. Excluding the significant severance payments we made, our full-year 2020 free cash flow margin is very close to double-digits. This gives us the confidence that we will achieve our ambition of double-digit free cash flow margin in 2021, and in turn, begin deleveraging the balance sheet, which is a top priority for us. For the sake of clarity, this double-digit ambition includes the effects of changes in working capital as well as any severance. Our net debt improved sequentially by $46 million, despite an unfavorable currency impact of $223 million. Net debt at the end of the year was $13.9 billion, a year-on-year increase of $753 million. Approximately $600 million of this increase is due to changes in exchange rates that impacted our foreign currency denominated debt. These currency movements are fully hedged and therefore will not result into any incremental net cash outflow. During the quarter, we made capital investments of $324 million. This amount includes CapEx, investments in APS projects, and multi-client. For the full-year 2020, we spent $1.5 billion on capital investments. In line with our capital stewardship program, for 2021, we are expecting to spend between $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion on capital investments. The CapEx portion of these investments is expected to be towards the lower end of our previous guidance of 5% to 7% of revenue. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier. Scott, I'll take this, -- Stephane. If you look at 2020 actually, our cash flows only benefited from a very modest working capital release. So, conversely, if you look at growth in 2021, we don't see a big working capital increase. There will be some as activity grows, but our working capital intensity is not that high. So, we will try to keep this to a minimum. And at the same time, we will benefit from the full-year effects of our cost-out program, which are all cost savings and the discipline on CapEx. So, we don't see working cap as a big headwind. We will be able to offset this with the underlying cash flow performance and get, for sure, to this double-digit free cash flow margin within the -- in 2021. So, Sean, actually, the few items you mentioned, they do of course help the margin. But, when you look at the global margin, taken together, those three items are not that material. So, the margin tailwind is mostly from the cost-out program actually, optimizing and resetting our earnings power. And from the incrementals on the international activity and the mix you've seen on our international margins, even on a full-year \u201820 basis, which was not the best, the best are pretty high. So, most of the margin expansion come from there and cost-out program with a little bit of help from the factors you mentioned, on a global basis. So, if I understand your question correctly, Chase, you are asking for the first quarter, some colors on the first quarter. I think, we have mentioned in our prepared remarks and in our earnings release that we anticipate after a strong quarter, the usual seasonal dip, partly international market. We see that every year, and we have seen it for the last 10 years. We don't see it different this year. I think, we don't see it as a pronounced dip. But we see it at a usual, what we say, seasonal effect that we see affecting Russia, affecting some of the China or offshore market in the first quarter.

Whereas in the land market activity, as we mentioned, we foresee a continuity of activity pickup that will transition from the growth rate we have seen in the last part of last year, and that will continue. And we see this growing at the same rate, both on rig and on completion activity. The margin there will see the -- on the revenue dips, you will have, of course, a bit of decremental. But it will not be as pronounced as we have normally indeed because of the OneStim effect going into Q1, particularly for NAM. So, the NAM margin of course will not decrease. And overall, we should be able to maintain overall the same level of margin. We are, of course, pretty much still working on these fronts and other. On the rigs, we have -- we are still looking at transactions in Australia. And then, in the Middle East, we have some progress there, but nothing to disclose at this stage. It's a bit of a different format than what we had looked at before, but it's still on the books. Regarding Canada, our APS project there, called Palliser, the macro environment is indeed getting quite better when looking at this asset. And we are -- we have a lot of interest building up. So, we think there is value to be extracted there. And I think, we'll be in a position even probably to launch a formal process sometime in the next few months. So, lots of interest in Canada and hopefully, it will result into something good happening this year. Sure. So really, as a reminder, we are really looking at the capital investments altogether, right, the CapEx portion, as you mentioned, APS and multi-client. And there, in 2020, we spent $1.5 billion. It was quite a reduction from 2019, a 45% reduction, more than what the revenue reduced actually, so the intensity reduced in 2020. So, we start from a very low base.

We'll monitor, but we'll stay within the range we stated for total capital investments."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Olivier Le Peuch",
            "content": "Thank you, ND. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us on the call. In my prepared remarks today, I will cover three topics, starting with our fourth quarter performance and my perspectives on what we accomplished in 2020. Thereafter, I will share our view of the 2021 outlook and the ambition we have set at the start of a new growth cycle. Stephane will then give more details on our financial results and we will open the floor to questions. First, let me start by thanking the women and men of Schlumberger for their resilience and outstanding performance in an exceptional year. The Schlumberger team significantly improved both, safety and service quality, two strong foundations of our performance strategy, despite COVID-19 adversity. In fact, this performance proved to be a critical differentiator for our customers, allowing us to strengthen our market position. This contributed to ending the year on a very strong note, and I am extremely proud of the results in the fourth quarter and our momentum headed into the New Year. In the fourth quarter, we delivered solid sequential revenue growth in both North America and the international markets and in all the four Divisions. We also recorded another quarter of sequential margin expansion, and cash flow from operation before severance was more than $1 billion. The recovery in the international markets and offshore, particularly deepwater, has commenced and was broad, with more than half of our international business units posting sequential growth, including most in MEA region. Our offshore long-cycle exposure and favorable positions in the short-cycle markets combined to deliver this peer-leading sequential international growth, ahead of rig activity. In North America, we posted strong double-digit revenue growth and sequential margin expansion, both onshore and offshore. Notably on land, our well construction and surface systems growth exceeded pressure pumping and outpaced rig count. This underscores the strength of our market position and breadth of services supporting shale activity and complementing our partnership with Liberty going forward. All-in-all, this was a very strong fourth quarter where we demonstrated the scale of our market exposure, the strength of our international franchise, the reset of our earnings power, and a very solid free cash flow conversion. Now, let me give you my perspective on what we had achieved last year. First, in line with our returns-focused strategy and as a response to the unique crisis, we restructured the Company globally, and in North America, we scaled to fit and high graded our portfolio. Internationally, we organized around key basins, addressed underperforming business units and contracts, and divested our Argentina APS asset. These actions have reset our operating leverage, and we exited 2020 with EBITDA margins restored to 2019 levels. Through 2021, we will build on this earnings power and visibly expand our margins. Second, we capitalized on growth drivers for the future, positioning our new Divisions ahead of the recovery cycle, aligned with our customers' workflows and key drivers in the new industry landscape, the digital transformation imperative, the mandate for sustainable and lower carbon operations, and the priorities for step change in Production & Recovery, maximizing reservoir performance, and well construction integration and efficiency. On digital, I am particularly proud of our achievements in 2020, both internally and externally. Through our industry digital platform strategy, we are enabling digital transformation at scale, unlocking significant value and leading innovation across the digital domain in our industry. This is further demonstrated by the highlights in our release this morning, which include enterprise-wide deployments, AI partnership, and expanding use cases of our digital platform. As a result, digital was the most resilient of our businesses during 2020, only second to subsea long-cycle, and is set to initiate an accretive growth cycle from 2021. Third, we launched Schlumberger New Energy to establish market positions and develop differentiated groundbreaking technology in multiple low or zero-carbon energy ventures. Our New Energy portfolio is very diverse and includes ventures in hydrogen, CCUS, lithium, geothermal, and geo-energy. As you have seen in this morning's earnings release, we announced significant progress with Celsius Energy and Genvia. In fact, we have made progress in every New Energy venture in 2020, enabling us to scale or to prepare entering commercial agreements for these ventures during 2021, an essential step in our clear ambition to position Schlumberger at the forefront of new and sustainable energy technology in the coming years. New Energy is a platform for long-term growth, and we will be making more announcements on these ventures over the coming weeks and months. Finally, last year, we accelerated our engagement with customers to provide solutions for the decarbonization of oil and gas operations and reinforced our commitment to improving our ESG performance. Specifically, we progressed on the adoption of both TCFD and SASB frameworks to increase the transparency of our environmental disclosures, resulting into the high-grading of our rating in the CDP Climate Change Program assessment to a peer-leading A minus. We also delivered a 15% reduction of our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions intensity within one year, well on our path to our stated 2025 emissions reduction goal. Now, I'd like to share some of our views on the 2021 outlook. Absent of a new setback in the pandemic control and economic recovery, we see constructive macro drivers developing through the course of the year. In the near-term, disciplined OPEC+ supply actions are supporting oil prices well above crisis levels, while demand is projected to build up throughout the year. The exact magnitude and scale of demand inflection will be driven by the pace of global vaccine rollouts, easing of lockdowns, and coordinated economic stimulus through 2021. In North America, we anticipate continued momentum and a strong start to 2021 in land markets as activity continues to build up towards maintenance levels, both in well construction and completions. However, U.S. production will still be visibly below previous production levels, as continued capital discipline and the impacts of consolidations will cap the spending level, and rate of growth may slow in the second half due to budget exhaustion. As a consequence, we anticipate growth in NAM to be in the mid-teens when contrasted with the run-rate of the second half of 2020, excluding OneStim. In this scenario and as the market starts to rebalance, the call on international supply will increase, and we do expect to see an acceleration of the international recovery, both short and long-cycle, after the seasonal dip in the first quarter. Thus, in 2021 we anticipate the international activity to build up from the second quarter and in the second half of the year to exceed second half of 2020 by double digits. This macro backdrop is very favorable to Schlumberger both in North America and internationally. We expect all Divisions, including Reservoir Performance on a pro forma basis excluding OneStim to post full-year incremental growth compared to the second half of 2020 with the growth trajectory across the different Divisions shaped by the NAM-international mix and the relative exposure to short and long-cycle markets. Building on this combined NAM and international activity recovery, our new operating leverage will support a very significant EBITDA margin expansion in 2021 with an ambition to achieve 250 to 300 bps improvement versus full-year 2020, and consequently visibly above 2019 margins. In North America, this ambition will be supported by restoring double-digit margins in 2021 as a result of our strategic actions combined with the strength of our offering outside of pressure pumping and strong contribution from the offshore business unit. Internationally, with more than 80% of revenue coming from markets that will experience activity momentum, we see the combination of a favorable long and short-cycle mix, the breadth of our market exposure, and our unique fit-for-basin technology as key drivers for margin expansion throughout 2021. I will now pass on to Stephane to discuss our financial results in greater detail. Stephane? Thank you, Stephane. I think, we are ready for taking the questions from all of you. Thank you, James. So indeed, I think as you have seen, we reminded everyone that we will see -- we will have seen the trough for international markets in the third quarter, and we expect this to start to rebound in the fourth which is what we have delivered. This was against a rig count that actually went down, and I think we here used the breadth of our offering, both short and long-cycle, the exposure we have which is very broad, very diverse to offset some of the rig contraction in some part of the international markets and realize some gain, occasionally [ph] our market position to offset and realize what we have delivered. So, we believe that first and foremost, the breadth of our offering, short and long-cycle, our performance, which is acknowledged by customers and giving us opportunity to encroach or gain share when activity comes back are the fundamentals of our market position internationally. Finally, we believe that our technology offering, fit-for-basin technology, digital are unique attributes that customers recognize and are ready to allocate share to have access to this technology and to leverage and to gain efficiency going forward. So, when you look now going forward on the long-term outlook, we have indeed -- we see that the market will accelerate beyond the inflection point that we see in the first quarter. That is a seasonal dip. And then we expect and anticipate that we could reach or exceed double digits on H2 to H2 on an exit-to-exit growth rate. And then, we anticipate that this will continue and even be strengthening in \u201822 and \u201823. No. First, I think, let me comment briefly on the fourth quarter results. Indeed, the fourth quarter result of the Digital & Integration division was a combination of very strong APS execution, multi-client sales that came from the seasonal effect of multi-client sales during the fourth quarter and international sales and success in our digital business. Going forward, we see beyond this exceptional performance. We still are confident that we'll be able to maintain on a full year basis the 30% or so margins for the division of integration and digital going forward. I think, it's difficult to decipher this or to bring granularity out to 2023 on how the market will recover per region. But globally speaking, I think, there will be an element of short and long cycle. So, we believe first that the region that were the most impacted and Latin America is one, will have recovery growth that will come maybe first because it's a combination of short and long cycle. We believe that the short cycle that exists in Middle East would favor that region both in short and midterm. We believe that Russia and Asia as well will benefit. And we believe that later in the cycle, from the second half of this year and later, the offshore market at large will start to benefit from long growth, but I think it's very difficult to give a granular view of this. I think the short-cycle will benefit from sometime later this year, and the long cycle will be accelerating, we believe, in \u201822 and \u201823. Very good question, Dave. I think, the pull is multi-faceted, I would say. There is pull from customers that are willing to step change the efficiency of their own workflows and hence gain productivity into their planning, field development, and evaluation of reservoir potential. And this is creating a pull for our workflow solutions with customers, which -- where we're building on our desktop solution and then creating a transition to the cloud to gain scalability, productivity, and collaboration. So, that's the first pull. The second pull is around unlocking the data. Customers are looking at ways to extract more value from the data that they own. And hence, they are looking for exploiting AI/ML tools that the industry can provide them. For this, there is this OSDU platform that the industry has adopted for which we contributed ourselves, the design of this ecosystem, and we are getting customers to pull us, and you have seen one example into our release this morning with AIQ in Middle East where the goal is to create AI solution for -- and with ADNOC and with Group 42 to deploy in the cloud in the region for ADNOC to benefit for this data insight. And finally, we see customers pulling into digital operation and trying to create step change into the way they execute their drilling, well construction or the existing extracting efficiency from their existing assets. So, these are the three pulls we see, and we have offerings that correspond to each. And you have seen that the OMV announcement this morning is mostly on the first and the second, on the workflows and the data, and you have seen some announcement we did last quarter and this quarter onto the digital operation. So, we see customers in all regions having an interest into expanding from the desktop to the cloud for their workflow, unlocking the value of that data through the cloud and through new digital solutions, including OSDU, and reaching out to operation and unlocking through edge application, the automation and application of AI to operation. So, we see this across multiple regions and all the customer type. Yes. Good question, Angie. Let me bring clarification back on what we said this morning in the prepared remarks. So, ambition for 2021 is to expand margin by 250 to 300 bps or higher, if the market conditions allow us, between 2021 and full-year 2020. And this will exceed vis-a\u0300-vis the 2019 margins on a full year basis. So, we see this will be driven by three factors. First, the full benefit of our restructuring efforts where we have realized at the end of 2020 more than 90% of our 1.5 permanent structural cost reduction; secondly, the impact of our portfolio high-grading in North America that will actually allow us in the current market condition to reach or exceed double digit in North America in 2021; and finally, from the incremental margins from our international franchise, where we expect the combination of efficiency measure, including digital, digital operation for our own operation, the combination of the firewall market mix, if I may, and the strength for fit-for-basin technology to differentiate and give us the edge and hence, the growth of our margin internationally. So, when you combine all of this, this will give us this margin -- visible margin expansion year-on-year of 250 to 300 bps or above visibly the 2019, despite being significantly down on top-line. So, Division per Division, we anticipate actually, from the run rate of -- for the full year, we expect all Division to actually expand margins on a full year basis. And I think this is not only digital. I think, Reservoir Performance by the exit of OneStim we'll, as Stephane did comment in his prepared remarks, get the benefit from that as a margin mix and will further expand, Well Construction due to efficiency and market growth we'll also get benefits on incremental. And production and digital, as I commented before, will establish itself at a high 20% or 30% margin for the full year. So, I hope it does clarify for you the margin mix and rationale and the drivers for this expansion. Okay. So, I'm not sure that I will have -- I will take the time to comment on each and every one of these. So, let me comment briefly on the Genvia. So, indeed, Genvia is a venture we have created with partners, including research arms of the -- in France to indeed industrialize, commercialize solid-oxide electrolyzer technology that is set to be changing a bit the usual efficiency of this electrolyzer use for green hydrogen production. The market towards 2030, to give you a sense, is expected to be about 70 gigawatts of installed capacity of electrolyzer that needs to be installed in the world globally. We've obviously ambition to be participating into that market and create and capture share of that market through our solution. Our solution will be to deliver this electrolyzer capacity to the market, sometimes used in -- for reversibility in fuel cells, and most of the time used to produce hydrogen. So, ambition indeed is to develop this across the next few years. Our milestones, speaking about this, will be to technically demonstrate this in the coming quarters and deliver some prototypes to our partners that will use it in fuel cell or in hydrogen production. And from that point on, in the next two or three years, make a decision, a critical decision to build and expand into large-scale manufacturing to respond and take share into this market. So, each of these ventures that we are entering into is using the same multi-steps approach where we invest in technology, we test the market with partners, and we then derisk, commercialize and ready ourselves for scale. So, that's the approach we are having, not entering into large capital-intensive project, but leveraging our domain, subsurface domain expertise that is very applicable for CCS, very applicable for geothermal, leveraging our technology, industrialization capability that is very applicable for all of this venture, and finally, leveraging our global footprint so that we can work with partners everywhere in the world and respond to the energy transition on a global basis. Yes. Thank you, Scott. I think, if we assume and take the hypothesis that the market indeed will converge towards maintenance mode in the U.S., we have to remember that through this crisis, the U.S. production has gone down by 2 million barrel. And if we assume that the next two or three years will not give us the activity, intensity and investment to recover this 2 million barrel, what will happen is that this 2 million barrel will have to be supplied internationally. Hence, the market share of supply will change in favor of international market. When you equate this and assume that the oil demand will go back to the 2019 level by 2023, and some are predicting earlier by 2022, I think, this will create the condition to -- for the budget spend internationally to actually match the 2019 by the 2023, 2025 latest horizon. Hence, it matches our hypothesis that we can return EBITDA of 2019 in the period of 2023 to 2025 as we'll benefit from this market rebound international from now to 2023. So, that's our hypothesis going forward is that the market supply share will rebalance slightly, will favor international and will, as a consequence, pull international activity to 100% or more in the next two or three years. I think, it's a mix of both. I think, you pointed out to the components. I think, we expect going forward that the contribution of EPS operating at -- with very strong performance. We have improved our performance significantly in that -- in this. We are increasing back the digital as a component of this going forward. We expect contribution of this maintaining EPS performance to the level that we have seen in the last two quarters. We divested some investment in APS as well. That has helped us improve the margin of APS. And the future growth, anticipated growth and margin accretion from digital will combine to maintain this at the level that I mentioned here, the high-20s or 30s. No. Thank you. I think, let me first comment on the actual results. And I think the actual results indeed, if you look at the very specific country, the very specific basin where we have growth to sort of the GeoUnits, as we call them, that had growth in the fourth quarter sequentially, where offshore GeoUnits from Guyana to Brazil, from the other around the world where we had -- and West Africa, did grow. So, that is a fact. And indeed, we can attribute this to market position and our market share that we have and benefit from in those markets clearly. And I think we had even a couple of them, including Guyana that were year-on-year growing from Q4 2019. So, we had some indeed traction into these. And I think that came from the market that did rebound in deepwater. Deepwater was in Q4 higher than in Q3 in term of actual rig count. It was offset by some other rig activity going down or slowing down in the fourth quarter. But, I think the offshore deepwater specifically was up. Now, going forward, we don't see a setback to that trend. And aside from the deep seasonal effect into the first quarter, we see that this will grow going forward. If we look at our projection, deepwater is actually a gain. The rig that will benefit the most in 2021 going forward into the teens in term of year-on-year projection by contrast with shallow that will only see single-digit as well as land. So, when you combine all of this, that give us the -- our market position established and demonstrated during the fourth quarter. And our anticipated rebound for long-cycle that we see in the contract out there for the deepwater give us the confidence that offshore will contribute meaningfully to our international rebound in second half. Yes. I think, I will -- to give granular view per venture, I think, we will give ourselves the next few weeks and months to prepare communication to all of you on that front. And for sure, before the mid-year, I think, we will come with a much better view for all of you on where we participate. But needless to say, that each and every one of the ventures we participate has a very significant potential on total addressable market. I think, we are here having the ambition a create a Division that will supplement the four Divisions that we currently have within the decade. And we believe that the market for each of hydrogen, CCUS, geothermal, geo-energy or lithium, is very significant. So, I don't want to go into any detail. But, I think I just mentioned and give you the example of the 70-gigawatt of electrolyzer capacity that will have to be installed within the next 10 years. That gives you a sense of what is happening. There will be 800 million tons of CCS that will have to be captured between now and the end of the decade in projects that will work with emitters to create conditions to capture and sequestrate this carbon, and lithium oxide as well for the high-density battery will grow significantly in the decade to come. So, each and every of this venture has a unique and fast-growing TAM. Now, the reason why we are maybe unique in our position into this. First, we have a domain that is relevant in experience into this, particularly in CCS and in geothermal. Second, I think, we have a track record of industrialization and development of technology at scale. And third, I think, we know how to partner and deliver technology and deploy technology and solution everywhere in the world with any partners. And you will see announcement coming in the next few weeks and few months as we'll illustrate that at scale. I think we -- as we said, I think we see the seasonal impact affecting international. We see the effect and positive effect of the non-effect on OneStim. And overall, I think we looked at the full year more than the first quarter. We are confident that the margin from operating margin will be steady as we transition the first quarter despite a minimum dip from seasonal effect, international, offset partially by North America. Yes. We will continue exert capital discipline, as you know. So, we'll make -- we want to give ourselves optionality, hence, our guidance. But we'll keep agility and extracting efficiency from our existing fleet to make sure we minimize the capital spend going forward. And we are here We are indeed very firm on to our being on the low end of our 5% to 7% for the CapEx aspect of our capital. Go ahead. Go ahead, sorry. We got an interruption here. Go ahead, please, Connor. Yes, we could hear you until this point. Go ahead. Great question, Connor. I think, obviously, we are very proud of this large enterprise deployment contract that we have earned with OMV, and we will work with them over the next few quarters to roll out our solution and create unique AI workloads that will accelerate and step change their positive efficiency for their own operation. But, this -- I think, to realize that this is a large contract is just also to compare the scale of some of our customers we're working for. The contract size can be much more significant than the one we have just announced. So, I think, the rates and the range of contract we'll -- we are engaged with our customers is very broad from customers that are willing to get access on demand to some simulation compute, or the customers are willing to do a full transition of all of their workflows, data and enterprise solution to the cloud, similar to what OMV is engaging with us is a broad portfolio of what we are engaging with customers. So, to give you an example, I don't think there is more than -- there is many more than one example, and it will go from single million dollar investment to a large multi-hundred million dollar over long-term contract. So, the typical engagement includes a transition engagement that will transition the data, transition the workflows, and then includes a transition to the SaaS model, Software-as-a-Service, or Data-as-a-Service for the long run. So, these typical contracts are 5 or 10 years and include a transition and then an exploitation part of the contract. No, I will not comment that way. I think, it depends on every contract on the commercial condition we negotiate with the customer. There is always obviously a technology investment that we have been doing for the last five years. And we continue to invest in technology. And every project and every commercial engagement is different. So, it's very difficult to make any projection or any trends. I believe that we gave a little bit of indication of the highly accretive margins, and we believe that this is true and holding true for the entire portfolio we have and would not want to comment project or contract by contract. No, we believe that we have created a very significant investment in the last five years when we created a foundation of this DELFI, Agora, OSDU foundation. We are working with partners to augment the capability of this foundation as per the announcement we made with IBM and the collaboration we have with Google and Microsoft. And we'll continue to work with partners, continue to spend and allocate a large portion of our engineering effort into this. And we believe that we are well covered to create the growth pattern that we have announced going forward. You're welcome, Connor. So, I believe that it's time to start to close. I think we are running out of time at the clock. So, thank you, everyone. And I think to conclude, I would like to offer three takeaways. First, the strength of our results during the first quarter-- the last quarter, built on a very broad performance improvement across divisions, both in North America and internationally, speaks volumes about our market positioning and the effectiveness of our strategic execution during the year. We are starting 2021 from a position of strength, having reset our earnings power and return potential. Second, with a gradual return of demand throughout 2021, we anticipate North America activity to continue consolidating towards sustaining production, and international activity rebounds to broaden and accelerate in the second half. This aligns very well with the evolution of our portfolio in North America and with our established international market positions and should lead all Divisions to post incremental growth in 2021 when contrasted to the second half of 2020, and for the company to expand full-year margins significantly above 2020 and visibly ahead of 2019. Third, our strategic execution has created a platform to capitalize on growth drivers in the new landscape, as we witnessed the beginning of a new chapter in our industry, a chapter where digital is an imperative for industry efficiency; a chapter where innovation and technology will impact field development, asset performance, and production & recovery; and a chapter where industry resilience will be defined by sustainability and lower carbon footprint. We are prioritizing our investment towards these growth drivers and at the same time, will continue to accelerate our expansion into New Energy venture to prepare for the future. Ladies and gentlemen, we are reinventing ourselves and are delivering financial results ahead of our stated ambition. Our company is on a new performance journey with attractive, yet resilient return, and very exciting growth prospects in and beyond our core industry. Thank you very much."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. And welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for your questions. As a reminder, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Vice President of Investor Relations, ND Maduemezia. Please go ahead.\nND Maduemezia: Thank you, Cynthia. Good morning, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited Third-Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Today\u2019s call is being hosted from Houston following the Schlumberger Limited Board meeting held earlier this week. Joining us on the call are Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Executive Officer; and Stephane Biguet, Chief Financial Officer. For today\u2019s agenda, Olivier will start the call with his perspective on the quarter and our updated view of the industry macro after which Stephane will give more detail on our financial results. Then we will open for questions. Before we begin, I would like to remind all participants that some of the statements we will be making today are forward looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and our other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our third-quarter press release. With that, I will turn the call over to Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, ND. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning. Thank you for joining us on the call today. In my opening remarks, I would like to focus my commentary on three parts: first, our third-quarter operational and financial performance; next, progress with the implementation of our strategy; and third, our updated view on the near-term business outlook. After this, Stephane will provide greater details on our financial results. In the third quarter, we had an opportunity to demonstrate the significance of the measures we have taken over the last few months and set a marker of outperformance\u2014through top-line resilience, margin expansion, and by maintaining our strong cash generation track record. In an ongoing activity trough, our third-quarter sequential performance was exceptionally strong. Yet again, we continued to maintain benchmarks of safety and service quality in our operations. Sequential margin expansion rebounded by more than 300 basis points for both IBT and EBITDA, and free cash flow was solidly positive. The strength of our margin expansion and free cash flow performance is even more impactful in the context of a slight topline decline and the exceptional items during the quarter. I would like to thank the entire Schlumberger team for this remarkable performance and for excellence in execution. These results represent a defining step in the reset of our earnings power at the trough of the cycle and set the stage for our long-term outperformance. Starting with operations, in the third quarter, we maintained benchmark integrity performance, with year-over-year improvements at 30% in HSE incident frequency and 34% in reliability. Operations integrity remains an area of strength for Schlumberger and the foundation of our performance strategy; our consistent service delivery earned several letters of commendation from our customers and is the basis of multiple new contract awards recorded in the quarter. Financially, we posted higher sequential pretax operating margins, more than 20% EBITDA growth and positive free cash flow\u2014despite the severance payments and reduced working capital release versus the prior quarter. These results clearly set us on the path to our intermediate goal of restoring 2019 EBITDA margins before the end of 2021. Now, let me turn to our strategy. First, our restructuring program is progressing well and we are on track to realize most of our permanent structural cost savings as we exit this year. We also began the transition to our leaner customer-aligned structure comprised of Divisions and Basins, designed to support the basin-specific innovation that will solidify Schlumberger\u2019s position as the performance partner of choice. Next, in North America, we achieved key milestones on our scale-to-fit strategy with two transactions that advance the high-grading of our portfolio, while lowering capital intensity and volatility\u2014the Liberty transaction and the low-flow divestiture. The closing of these transactions will not only enhance our EBITDA margin at the global level but will further support lower capital intensity and an accelerated path to our financial goals for North America. Looking ahead at the benefits of this strategy execution, we are set to significantly improve the company\u2019s future operating leverage. And as the market activity recovers from the current trough, we have the potential to restore EBITDA to the 2019 mark of $6.6 billion by recovering only half of the year-on-year revenue decline. Our performance strategy also focuses on new horizons of growth, which includes Digital and Production & Recovery. The industry is rapidly embracing digital enablement and shifting capital investment toward maximizing production and recovery from existing assets. Where these two industry shifts converge in essence, where digital intersects with production and recovery, Schlumberger has a unique opportunity to deploy the full power of our industry digital platform and domain expertise, spanning reservoir and production for the benefit of our customers. The best example of this was the application of our Agora* edge AI and IoT solutions on our APS project in Ecuador. By connecting field equipment to the cloud and running predictive AI at the edge, we boosted production 30% on Agora-connected wells while significantly reducing field crew visits to these wells and, as such, cutting HSE exposure and environmental impacts. This created revenue and margin on an APS project where we captured the value directly, and is just an example of what is possible at scale when we use the power of the industry digital platform to blend hardware and software to enable people\u2014wherever they are located\u2014to make performance impacts with digital. In addition, we continued to expand the reach of our digital platform, as demonstrated by the IBM Red Hat OpenShift agreement, further enabling adoption of our platform around the world, and particularly, with NOCs. In the quarter, we have also secured notable subsea and artificial lift contracts in the Gulf of Mexico and in the Middle East, which will result in the growth of our installed base and greater exposure to Production & Recovery CapEx and OpEx\u2014a strong platform for the future. Finally, we continue to develop our New Energy portfolio with progress in our hydrogen technology venture, Genvia, and the creation of a geothermal project development company, which complements our low-heat geothermal venture, Celsius Energy. These exciting ventures represent a mix of unique opportunities for Schlumberger to create a differentiated market position through the energy transition. In parallel, we continue to develop avenues to contribute to the decarbonization of oil and gas operations, leveraging our technology, expertise, and execution platform to reduce our environmental impact while helping our customers reach their environmental goals. Let me take a few moments now to talk about the outlook. In the short- to mid-term horizon, the market uncertainties persist as the economic recovery remains fragile. The pace of demand recovery could possibly slow or pause as a result of a second wave of pandemic outbreaks or heightened pandemic control measures. Similarly to the third quarter, we also face risks of lingering COVID-19 operational disruptions internationally as we enter the winter season. In this context, we will continue to focus on what we can control and react promptly if necessary. Now, absent of a pause in demand recovery or higher COVID-19 disruption, the fourth quarter activity will likely extend the trends experienced as we close the third quarter, with the continuation of a modest activity uptake in North America and the stabilization towards a steady activity internationally\u2014albeit with visible seasonal variations, the combination of which resulting into an about flat outlook overall for the quarter. Looking out further, the prevailing uncertainties make it much too early to call. However, directionally, and absent of a slowdown in the pace of economic recovery, we anticipate the overall activity to consolidate gradually during 2021. In line with the most recent IEA projections, we see that the conditions still exist to rebalance demand and supply with improving demand recovery supported by economic stimulus measures and continued supply discipline from the major producers, ultimately resulting into a visible activity rebound. North America land is expected to continue its subdued recovery in frac and drilling activity towards production maintenance levels. Internationally, as demand recovers, a pull on short-cycle supply will result in an activity inflection, this being anticipated by most operators currently evaluating options to restore activity. Having shared our view on the outlook, let me now hand over to Stephane who will talk more about our financial results.\nStephane Biguet: Thank you, Olivier, and good morning ladies and gentlemen. Third-quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.16. This represents an increase of $0.11 sequentially and a decrease of $0.27 when compared to the same quarter of last year. During the quarter, we recorded $350 million of pretax restructuring charges. These charges primarily relate to facility exit costs, as we continue to rationalize our real estate footprint. As a result of these charges, our pretax operating income will increase by approximately $15 million per quarter going forward due to reduced lease and depreciation expenses. Overall, our third-quarter revenue of $5.3 billion decreased 2% sequentially. Pretax segment operating margins increased 355 basis points to 10.9%. More importantly, company-wide adjusted EBITDA margins increased 371 basis points to 19.4%. As a reminder, our full-year 2019 adjusted EBITDA margin was 20.2%. In other words, we are well on our way to restoring our precrisis EBITDA margins of 2019, despite the severe revenue reduction we have experienced. This will be achieved through the combination of our restructuring actions and the high-grading of our portfolio. As a reminder, our restructuring program will permanently remove $1.5 billion of fixed costs on an annual basis. We have achieved more than 80% of these cash savings as of the end of the third quarter. We expect to complete most of the remaining actions as we exit the fourth quarter. As it relates to the high-grading of our portfolio, we achieved two significant milestones this quarter with the signing of an agreement to divest our North American low-flow artificial lift business in a cash transaction, followed by an agreement to contribute our OneStim\u00ae pressure pumping business to Liberty Oilfield Services in exchange for a 37% equity interest in Liberty. We received antitrust clearance for both transactions and we anticipate each of the closings to occur before the end of the year. It is worth noting that both transactions will be accretive to our earnings in 2021. Let me now go through the third quarter results for each segment. Third-quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $1 billion decreased 4% sequentially, while margins decreased 90 basis points to 16.7%. These decreases were primarily due to lower sales of WesternGeco multiclient seismic licenses in North America offshore. Drilling revenue of $1.5 billion decreased 12% sequentially while margins were essentially flat at 9.5%. The revenue decrease was driven by an activity decline in US land where the rig count dropped significantly combined with COVID disruptions and customer budget adjustments in several international GeoMarkets. Despite the revenue drop, margins were resilient as a result of cost reduction measures. Production revenue of $1.8 billion increased 12% sequentially and margins increased 11 percentage points to 12.6%. These increases were largely the result of a resumption of activity in our APS projects in Ecuador, following last quarter\u2019s production interruption caused by a major landslide. OneStim also increased on higher fleet utilization, while profitability improved across each of our Completions, Artificial Lift, and Well Services product lines due to cost reduction measures. Cameron revenue of $1 billion decreased 5% while margins decreased by 162 basis points to 6.3% on lower OneSubsea\u00ae revenue in Asia and Europe, as well as lower Surface Systems equipment sales in North America. Now turning to our liquidity. I was again very pleased with our cash flow generation. During the quarter, we generated $479 million of cash flow from operations and $226 million of free cash flow, despite making $273 million of severance payments. This performance confirms that our cash flow generation capabilities remain intact. As a result, we will generate excess cash once our restructuring efforts are complete and, therefore, be in a position to deleverage the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with total cash and investments of $3.8 billion. Our net debt at the end of the quarter was$13.9 billion, an increase of $149 million compared to last quarter, but down almost half a billion when compared to the same time last year. During the quarter, we spent $200 million on CapEx and invested $28 million in APS projects. Our total capital spend for 2020, including APS and multiclient, is still expected to be approximately $1.5 billion. This represents 45% decrease as compared to 2019, mostly coming from lower CapEx in North America and reduced investments in APS projects. We took further steps to strengthen the balance sheet during the quarter. We issued $500 million of 1.400% Notes due 2025. The proceeds will be used to repay 2.200% Notes that mature in November. We also issued 350 million of 2.650% Notes due 2030. The proceeds were used to pay down commercial paper borrowings. Finally, we ended the quarter with available liquidity of $10.8 billion. Before I conclude, and just as a reminder, due to our corporate reorganization we will report our results on the basis of the four new Divisions starting in the fourth quarter. We are working to provide historical restated financial information based upon the new Division structure and expect to publish this in November. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Stephane. Ladies and gentlemen, I think we are ready to open the call for the questions.\nOperator: Thank you [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. And your line is open.\nJames West: First, just a statement from me. I really appreciate you clearly stating the goal of returns above your cost of capital, or value creation as we see it, because most of the industry has lacked that progress in the last decade or so. So thank you for stating that as a clear goal of Schlumberger. The first question I have for you is you've taken several defining steps towards the reinvention of Schlumberger so far, using this crisis to your somewhat advantage. Could you talk maybe about the steps taken, and then what we should expect going forward?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Great question, James. So thanks again. Indeed, we are set to continue to execute our strategy for improving our return above cost of capital. That's the foundation, okay. And we'll do that in several ways, cash flow, margins and discipline on capital, obviously. So you have seen that we have not wasted the crisis, as we could say, taking the opportunity to restructure our organization to reset to the new -- what we expect in normal. And I think we have done that in anticipating that the market will be structurally smaller, albeit it will be defined by new attributes. One of them is the basin attributes where we believe regionalization will become more critical, hence the creation of our Basin structure to support our clients in the basin to outperform in every basin, and that's the fit-for-basin strategy that is in light there. The second, obviously, transition is digital. I think digital is happening everywhere, in the office, in operation, in all aspects of our workflows, and we believe that this is a transformative step that we are ready to support. And last, I would say at a very high level, I believe that Production & Recovery will become more critical going forward as the mature assets will have to be -- the return on mature assets will have to be improved. And at the same time, energy transition from gas technology up to midstream as well as transition to new energy. I think this will give us the digital, the production recovery, the energy transition starting with gas, will give us the element of growth that will then leverage our new operating platform with the division basin as you have seen restructured to give us the opportunity to much expand our margins and reach and exceed our return above cost of capital. That's what we are set to achieving, James.\nJames West: And then on the margin expansion comment, you're sticking to the getting back to '19 EBITDA margins by the end of '21. What needs to happen to drive that? Do we need market growth? Is it the cost-outs you've already taken? What are the kind of key things we should be looking for to ensure that, that happens?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think there are three elements. I think the first and foremost and the one that have the most impact to date in our quarter results is the restructuring we have done when we adjusted our permanent structure and variable costs to the new normal and to the new level of activity as we foresee. And I think this has a significant amplifying impact on our return to margin expansion. So the second factor is a continuation of our strategic action in North America that aims at high-grading our portfolio and taking step to make sure that we retain and continue to invest in portfolio where we believe we can differentiate and create return above our threshold. And third is the leverage of our international footprint. So when you combine the core [inaudible] and structural adjustments that we have done to lift and reset our earnings power, the action we have taken to enhance significantly our margins in North America, our play in North America and international mix leverage, all of this will combine to elevate and gradually build our EBITDA margin to the 20% of EBITDA of 2019. And we don't need much growth to achieve this.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Angeline Sedita. And your line is open.\nAngeline Sedita: So a little bit to James' question around the 2019 EBITDA margins. And would you say, number one, that digital is further accretive to that 20% margin and the return to that 20% margin that you saw in 2019? And do you think those margins are as normalized for Schlumberger this cycle, or could it be better? And then finally on that as you said in your remarks, $6.6 billion in EBITDA on half the revenue, that's certainly above consensus estimates for '21 and '22. Can you give us further color there and a time line?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Okay, a comprehensive question, Angie. Thank you. So first on digital, is it accretive? Absolutely. It's accretive today. It's accretive tomorrow. I think it will be accretive in the future, at a step that is certainly pulling our margins up. And I think what we are looking for to accelerate is our growth CAGR, so that it is accretive not in the future at a larger scale. So digital is and will be accretive on the way forward. Absolutely. The second question you asked is on the EBITDA of 2019, if I understand correctly, what you asked for, Angie, to reiterate. So yes, I think we are clear on our ability to deliver this EBITDA margin improvement to 20% above in the short term. And the mix we need, as I said and commented with James, is very clear. It's a combination of international, our restructuring and the international exposure that we have that are greatly accretive to this. Finally, you asked a question about when and how we will go beyond this. Our mid-cycle margin ambition is above that level. We are at a trough, at operating already very close to this 2019, having operated-- or reset of our margins. Our expectation is continuing to grow and expand, again, building our international franchise, building and accelerating our digital and being the full proof on this, but also continue to execute on our capital discipline, capital stewardship that will high grade our portfolio and will resolve some of the still outstanding underperforming business units. So, you combine growth internationally, the power of digital and our discipline on capital stewardship and addressing our underperforming contract, you have the recipe to expand the margin beyond this 20%. And you can make the math. I think we would expect indeed that with half the revenue coming back from 2019, we will expect to be in a position to reach or exceed this dollar EBITDA contribution. So, I think when is this happening, some time in the future, not 2021 clearly. 2022 will be the beginning of a cycle of international expansion, that's very likely. And after that, there will be some time but we believe this is in sight and that's what we are working to towards.\nAngeline Sedita: So one more on Liberty. Maybe you could talk about the transaction in a little bit more detail, the magnitude of the accretion opportunity, the access to the customer and well site without having frac and the determination of when you'll exit Liberty? Are you a medium-term owner or a long-term owner of those shares?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I'll let Stephane answer some, and I will answer on the customer engagement. Please, Stephane, on the transaction.\nStephane Biguet: Yes, sure, Angie. We are actually progressing quite well on our integration planning. The good news, we are identifying, through this process, additional synergies and opportunities for our technology collaboration that makes this combination even more compelling than we initially contemplated. So we are quite happy with partnering with Liberty. We believe there's quite a lot of upside potential in the combined company as the company -- as the synergies are realized and the market starts to recover. So we will benefit from the North American unconventional recovery as our equity stake will continue to appreciate and we will also leverage our technology alliance with Liberty. So, it is premature in that context to talk about monetization, considering where we stand in the cycle. But that will, of course, remain an option over the longer term. We have not set a timeline for this. We have not set a target price. But it will always remain an option. In terms of accretion, we've stated it will be accretive from day one. So, going into 2021, it will be positive for sure on our EPS, EBITDA and margins overall.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yes, I can only reinforce that I think our value proposition, the value proposition of Liberty on the market with our existing customer, I think, is undoubtful very strong with this platform, as you pure play-- the largest pure-play frac company. But we are putting in place the contract and service-level agreements across both companies to cross-license technology and to create pull-through so that we can extend the Liberty workflow and the value proposition of well site, and we can pull them on some of the contract we have on well construction, over contract to where we participate across and around the frac operation. So clearly, for both the -- beneficiary on both.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of David Anderson with Barclays.\nDavid Anderson: So digital, you've talked about digital being a core part of Schlumberger's growth strategy, and you stated the goal to double the revenue in the medium term. Curious kind of where acquisitions fit in that part as part of the goal. I asked this back in the '90s, of course, Petrel and ECLIPSE were crucial to your success that followed the 2000s, and it's still a big part of your offering. But more recently, you've announced kind of partnerships and venture-backed companies you're involved in. I just like to understand a little bit more about your digital growth strategy as you build this business out.\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think first and foremost, our strategy will evolve around a digital platform, establishing a digital platform for industry, both from the -- in the geoscience subsurface side, building on our desktop offering today and building up on our market strengths and establishing with what we did with OSDU, an open-platform foundation with data ecosystem shared with the industry and offering industry as the foundation for this. So we believe that this transition to the cloud will cement our desktop leadership position we have today and expand and create growth opportunity with new transition similar to the Chevron, similar to the Suncor, similar to the Woodside transition that we are doing with the DELFI core expanding into the cloud. So this alone is a growth avenue. The second one is digital operation, as I will call it. And I think it extends DELFI to the drilling or to the production space. But also, we have been extending and using the concept of digital platform to also introduce what we call Agora, a gateway and a platform that offers opportunity to plug AI or edge application on equipment. And I think you have seen two examples of which we described into the press release earlier today and I think this is an expansion. So that's the second axis of expanding beyond the core or beyond geosciences and expanding into operation. And the third, I think, is the domain of AI and of offering services for our customers to extract more from their workflow across and using an element of our platform, not necessarily the application but using the platform as a basis for creating value to their own IP, to their own integration capability and where we act as a system integrator and we act as a support for their workflow. So these are the avenue of growth. So we'll continue to make partnership as a basis for building these platform stacks. And we will, and when as appropriate, we believe that we have -- if we believe we have gaps into our offering and in operation, or in geosciences or in AI, we will make bolt-on acquisition, as we'll call it, to supplement or to complement this so that we better respond to this and expand in New Energy or expand into the gas midstream, for example, using the same platform.\nDavid Anderson: So Olivier, I think one of the struggles for investors is taking digital from a conceptual idea into real-life practice. And you mentioned Agora several times in the release today. And I was wondering if you could talk about two things. If you can talk about Agora and the IBM Red Hat agreement, kind of two separate things here. Agora being more edge computing-driven, maybe you could just talk about kind of what is the best application? Where do you see that fitting in terms of your business? Like what's the most obvious application of where you can really make a difference? And secondarily, on the IBM Red Hat, you've targeted NOCs as being the customer. So what is that bringing to the NOC customer?\nOlivier Le Peuch: So first, Agora. Simply said, Agora brings us ability to bring on every piece of equipment on the platform, on the rig, an ability to connect this piece of equipment to the cloud and to our platform and yet offering at this point, at this edge, an open platform where partners can provide and can plug their application, AI application typically, that will add value to this data feed. The perfect example is what you have seen on the PETRONAS application, where we have not been developing this video spacing analysis tool. One of our partners have just deployed their video tool on to our platform and connected to the camera and we served as a gateway back to the cloud. So we just provide a platform that our customer are licensing and installing on their equipment. And then their own partners, our partners, are creating value with AI routines or AI application at the edge that connects to the cloud. That's what people like in a secure way. Red Hat Openshift, simply said, is an ability to provide multiplicity of options for cloud deployment for our customers that offer hybrid cloud deployments on-premise and public and address the concern that some of our customers in some countries were facing that they cannot export their data to the public cloud, because it is -- data is present -- data residency issue, or they believe they need to control and have in-house premise cloud infrastructure. For these two solutions, we provide through OpenShift an ability to deploy DELFI on on-premise cloud infrastructure or on cloud that are not public cloud, hence addressing a market that we cannot address today. It's about 50% of the market today, 50% of the country that don't have or do not prefer to use public cloud for their hosting their data that we're unlocking through this. So, we are unlocking a significant part of market.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC. Your line is open.\nKurt Hallead: So, Olivier, I just wanted to congratulate you and your team on a very fast pivot through an extremely difficult situation. I know you highlighted Digital way back when you first joined in September and then reiterated it in January, and it sounds like it's already paying dividends for you. So, kudos on that quick pivot. My question for you, Olivier, is we've seen a lot of recent commentary out of the major oil companies about their shift to budget from intensive fossil fuel dynamics to more green -- renewables and so on and so forth, with BP probably being the most radical in that process. Trying to connect the dots here, but it seems like with the clean energy business that you established back in the spring, it set Schlumberger up to be very well positioned in line with the potential future spending plans of some of your existing customers. So, I was just wondering if you could give us a little bit more insights on how you view potentially the clean energy business evolving over time?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think, obviously, we see it's not only a trend that we want to capture with our existing customers. I think, obviously, some of our customer segments are transitioning into a different role as energy company and want to add to that portfolio beyond oil and gas, including some technology and some renewables in which we also have interest. And I think at large, what we have realized is that we have a technology platform. We have an ability to deploy at scale technology. We have a subsurface knowledge. When you combine all of this, we believe that we have market position that we can take, develop into the New Energy business, be it on renewable, be it on the energy storage or be it on hydrogen. And I think this is where we are developing our venture today. We are developing it in geothermal, both low-heat and deep geothermal. That's very adjacent to our business because it exploits our subsurface knowledge, our drilling, well construction, and our ability to manage heat flows from subsurface to surface and provide digital platform to control it. So that's where we're heading. The hydrogen is very, very interesting for us because it's a huge opportunity, partially led by EU, with Green Deal and there are two avenues there. One avenue is the green hydrogen or electrolyzer where we believe we, with our new venture, Genvia, are in a position to create differentiated offering in the market to provide the market with higher efficiency and more versatile electrolyzer that can feed this 40-gigawatt capacity that EU is planning for 2030. And finally, I think we will continue to also look into CCS, which is again close to our core. But not CCS application for oil and gas, but CCS application to decarbonize the hard-to-abate sector, ammonia or SMR for hydrogen production through gas. And these are the sector that outside of our oil and gas customer, that's where we believe we can add value. And when you combine all of this, this is a very exciting future with New Energy, and we are taking position today for the long run.\nKurt Hallead: My follow-up question would be, Olivier, you mentioned the prospect for short-cycle projects to accelerate, especially in the international markets when heading out into 2022. And I know you don't want to get pinned down to any kind of specifics, but I'm just kind of curious how you would think about the magnitude of rebound. And again, you don't have to get too specific here, but just wondering how sharp of a rebound you would expect and maybe what geographic regions you would think would lead the way.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yes. I think what we see is that, clearly, I think the level of investment that's currently going into international is not sustainable, I think for two reason. I think that the demand/supply will rebalance and will create a pull on supply worldwide, and I think this will be pulling on international as well as the U.S. The North America has suffered from a setback that is creating a gap in the future supply. [Technical Difficulty] So I think short cycle is set to come back first, and then long cycle. The timing of this and the magnitude, I think, will depend on the -- obviously, on the demand -- oil demand pace, recovery pace. But what we can say is that customers are already engaging and are asking us to be ready for mobilization, be it in short or midterm, to make sure that we're not getting in the wrong direction to cut capacity beyond what they will need in the short to mid-term. So, I will expect the low-cost producer country on the core of OPEC plus to be the first to react and to rebound when the market will be there. So that includes Middle East, that includes Russia, obviously. Beyond that, I think we will see short cycle everywhere. China will continue to be executing on their energy strategy, so I don't expect this to be slowing down. And then we will see gradually infield drilling. We will see the shallow water coming back. And there's a lot of FID ready to be approved that will then accelerate back to the border. So, I think there will be a sequence in this, but short-cycle will come back, both onshore and offshore, and will come back certainly sometime in 2021 and clearly, in 2022.\nOperator: Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. And your line is open.\nScott Gruber: Olivier, I want to come back to the renewables question. You highlight several interesting initiatives. Do you have an aspiration for renewables to be a certain percentage of revenues by, pick your year, 2025, 2030? And just given your scale, what does this mean for CapEx spend, R&D spend? And overall, how do you think about balancing a desire to see, what I believe would be your desire to see a measurable portion of your revenue stream becoming leveraged to renewables while also continuing to drive improved financial performance?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yes, absolutely. I think it's too early to quote a number. I think it's something that we are working, and we are continuing to develop our strategy. But I think I will not call it renewable. I think it's more than renewable. And it's not--intersects renewable, but I think it's the technology approach we have and it's not necessarily -- don't expect us to buy wind farms and go after capital projects. So that's not our intent. Our intent is to continue to play and build on our strengths, strength being our technology, being a technology partner for a renewable company, being technology partner for some of our current existing customers and being technology partner for addressing a new economy, such as hydrogen economy. I think this is where we want to be. Obviously, I want this to be meaningful. I want to be at scale in the next decade for sure, because I think at that time, we want to be in a position where we believe we will be diversifying our portfolio and building and leveraging the growth that is existing in these to make sure that we are having a diversified portfolio, but still a technology portfolio and a service and technology offering with solution to this market. So again, it's a long-term ambition with short-term investments that are helping us to create market position that are unique, that will gradually being reinforced. And we'll take a bigger position on the one we believe have the most potential in the coming years.\nScott Gruber: And I just want to circle back on the 20% EBITDA margin target for next year. You did about 19% in 3Q and what I imagine is likely close to 20% ex the to-be-divested businesses. It just seems that 20% is easily achievable, if not beatable, next year. But what am I missing? Is there still some concern around pricing as contracts roll into next year? Is there some concern that maybe customer spending abroad won't lift that much over the course of '21? So why shouldn't we consider the 20% EBITDA margin a relatively low bar, just given your 3Q performance?\nOlivier Le Peuch: No. First, the way we define it is a full-year target we are taking. It will happen before the end of 2021. We believe the trajectory of the year with a gradual recovery will give us the opportunity to create a full year target that will be set at this level, or exceed. Do we anticipate and see more pricing? No. I think the pricing has been -- the pricing pressure has been with us for the last six years. I think, as I commented before, I think we have been giving away and the industry at large have been under pressure for this. The industry now is realizing that there's so much we can give, and we are working more collaboratively with our customers to find solutions to eliminate waste. Now obviously, large integrated contracts are still competitively priced, but we see that through performance, through technology, and through smart engagement and alignment with our customer, we're able to offset those pricing and competitive pressure and realize margin resilience. So pricing is and will remain with us in these years to come, possible headwinds but mostly on large integrated contracts. And I believe that when activity will come back, we\u2019ll get opportunity to get back pricing in the right market.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sean Meakim with JPMorgan.\nSean Meakim: So, Olivier, I think the energy transition topic naturally kind of begs the question about the outlook for international E&P spending in the coming cycle. I appreciate your earlier comments on the cadence of how work will come back, say, next year. But what's also going to be different in this cycle is that your customers have additional calls on their cash flow that are being prioritized before upstream spending, right? IOCs are diverting more capital towards renewables, that's the plan. Independents have a first call on their cash to their balance sheets. I'm just curious how those factors influence your expectation around the international spending cycle and specifically offshore, as IOCs control most of the, specifically deepwater, acreage globally.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yes, that's a correct assumption. And I think we believe that what will happen is that the market will consolidate around basin's position that each of the major and large independent will concentrate on their basin plays and other strengths. And we-- I believe that we have to be smart about aligning with our customers in those key basins, be it around their core assets, such as Exxon in Guyana, such as some other IOCs in Brazil or in East Africa. We will make sure that we align ourselves with those so that we maximize the uptake of market position in those basins and continue to execute our fit-for-basin and engagement with customers to make sure we maximize those position. So that's the first thing we want to do. Next, I will comment that the national oil company are part of the mix, and I think the deepwater is indeed more domain where international companies dominate. And I think we have there a very strong position. But from shallow to land, there is a lot of activity that is pulled, both short and long cycle, by national company. And in Middle East, most of the offshore activity, if not all of the offshore activity, is led by national oil company and is growing fairly well and has been more resilient than the land activity. So we will hold on those positions and make sure we continue, as we have seen some contracts have been awarded in this domain continue to post this. So we understand that the market will be structurally different than what we could have anticipated five years ago. But we believe that the position around key basins of strength from our customers and aligning ourselves with this will provide us the opportunity to capture most of this international growth coming back.\nSean Meakim: And then I want to touch on Reservoir Characterization as well, and that segment has experienced a lot of volatility in its margins the last couple of quarters, much more than we've seen historically. I'm just curious how you'd characterize the gravitational center for those margins once the business has cost reductions impacted, et cetera. How do you think that business looks like on a full year basis once we get it through these near-term challenges?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think the comment I will offer on this is that this market is a market where the exploration market sits. And the exploration market is set from discretionary spend and it includes the multi-cloud sales that historically have been a little bit of a swing that depends on the season and depends also on the exploration discretionary budget that is available for our customers to invest in future exploration acreage. So that has left a little bit of variability. The variability has been bigger in recent times because the proportionate scale of exploration has reduced. Hence, when exploration campaign comes back, which happens every other season, and when the discretionary spend on exploration through multi clients this combines to create a very strong quarter. But at the base, the related testing, wire line and digital are still performing very well. Software was growing this quarter, one of the very few product line that did grow quarter-on-quarter and did grow as an example. So, expect this to be the consequence of most of the exposure we have on discretionary exploration spend and the exploration campaign viability that we see quarter-on-quarter. This is the most of the rationale for this more than any core issue we will have in any of the product lines that are there. Now commenting on the future, we will not comment anymore on Reservoir Characterization, as we'll comment on the new Divisions that we are setting in place. And part of it will be in digital, part of it will be in Reservoir Performance Division. So, you will get more detail on this in the coming months.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Voie with Wells Fargo. And your line is open.\nChris Voie: First question, just a little bit of a clarification, sorry if I missed this. But I believe your opening remarks on the outlook suggested flat quarter-to-quarter in the fourth quarter. Is it fair to assume that, that applies at the EBITDA line, so just north of $1 billion?\nOlivier Le Peuch: That's a fair assumption. I think we have some favorable and unfavorable play that we believe will balance out, and the ambition will be indeed to maintain roughly both the margins and the dollar, on an all about flat.\nChris Voie: And then secondly, I wonder if you could just give a little more detail on the progression for the cost savings. I guess you're exiting about 80% in the third quarter. It should be almost done in the fourth quarter, that's maybe $60-ish million incremental. Should we think there's much left in 2021 from that and is that international or, I imagine that's mostly international basis? But is there any progress there in North America as well?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Stephane?\nStephane Biguet: Yes, I'll take this, Chris. There is -- yes, we were above -- quite a bit above 80%. So, there is a bit left. There will be still a bit left going into Q1. It is mostly on the international, the tail end of it. And North America is mostly complete. So, you will see a bit more push from this in Q4, but some remainder are going into the first half next year. Does this answer your question?\nChris Voie: And just to finish up on that restructuring. So, the cost of those savings is pretty light compared to expectations in the third quarter, around [$273 million]. Do you think those costs would be higher in the fourth quarter? I think expectations are near $1 billion for the second half. So, will the cost of savings be much higher in the fourth quarter?\nStephane Biguet: Yes. It's not an exact science there, to be honest. The cash outlays, they get spread out. It could be a little bit higher in the fourth quarter. However, the cash flow from operations, traditionally in the fourth quarter, also increases. So, I think we could very well end up with free cash flow, including severance, still quite positive. And if everything goes well, it could even be higher than in Q3, even though we have higher severance potentially.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Bill Herbert with Simmons Energy. And your line is open.\nBill Herbert: At this point based upon the dialogue that you're having with your international customers, of course, international on a pro forma basis is going to be 80% of revenues once we consummate OneStim. But you mentioned strong customer engagement with regard to the dialogue that you're having for international. At this point, do you think international revenues in 2021 are up year-over-year?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think the way you look at -- we look at it, is to look at the current level of activity. And we use more or less the second half of this year as a baseline. Because I think the reset for international oil company has happened in the second quarter, for independent has happened in the second and the third and for national oil company has happened in the third. So, the reset of activity has happened in the last six months. Now we believe that we have stabilized, and we have seen it in the last few weeks, and we don't believe that, aside from seasonal impact, we don't believe that there will be structural adjustment in the short term. And that's our baseline. So, from that baseline, we will anticipate this to get an upside from that baseline and to gradually recover from that baseline [of work]. Now to compare it year-on-year, including the first quarter of this year up to the mix international second quarter, including the significant effort in Middle East to increase supply early Q2, I don't think it's realistic. We have to take a baseline of the second half of this year and project forward. And from that base build back a recovery.\nBill Herbert: Fair, but the COVID related disruptions that you witnessed in Q3, I would assume, hopefully, are not going to be as acute in 2021. But moving on, with regard to your high-grading of your portfolio, we have announced OneStim and low flow. I'm just curious in terms of what are the most tangible high grading opportunities remaining in your portfolio.\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think we'll continue to focus on each and every business line we have operating in North America. We have already made effort to rationalize and to make sure that we operate in the basin of North America, where we believe we can sustain a differentiation and participate fully going forward. We have made a choice to accelerate some technology access and fit-for-basin in some part of our portfolio to high-grade their performance. So, I will say that all of our portfolio the entire business line, I would say, has opportunity to improve their returns by tuning. And I think what we have done on structural reset is lifting. And the business line have improved this quarter beyond OneStim, the performance of North America business line this quarter have improved. So, we have a way to go to further improve this and to target our recovery of margin in North America. And I will say that we do that on both the growth for the market where we have strong alignment, the well construction, the production recovery, the digital and we do that on the bottom line, where we continue to use technology access or restructuring to make sure that we execute with the return we desire in this North America. So, we'll continue to gradually improve the performance, that's our goal.\nBill Herbert: What I meant by high grading, though, was additional disposition opportunities in your portfolio.\nOlivier Le Peuch: I will not comment on that. I think we continue to look at every portfolio and we look at it from the light of does it bring us the growth and accretive return opportunity in the long run, or do we have a better way to monetize and to be occasionally opportunistic about this portfolio? So this is true for those portfolio there and as well as in other markets. But we'll continue to look at it and we will be disciplined to making the right decision for the shareholder here.\nOperator: Thank you. We have time for one final question, and that will be from the line of Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley. And your line is open, please go ahead.\nConnor Lynagh: I was wondering, maybe a higher level one to close it out here. So, we're about to get to look at your new reporting structure. And I know that Digital & Integration is probably the one that you have the most excitement about growing and improving earnings from. But if we remove that from the equation, when we take a look at what you guys are doing in, say the third quarter in the Reservoir Performance, Well Construction, Production Systems, et cetera. Where would you sort of point us to in the near term? And by near term I mean over the next 12 to 18 months here. Where would you see the greatest opportunities for improvement in earnings? And would you say that, that is more driven by costs or more driven by select growth opportunities in those portfolios?\nOlivier Le Peuch: No, setting aside D&I, which have both a margin expansion opportunity and growth on the back of digital, indeed, I think we can look at it from Well Construction, where we believe that our market position will benefit from the return of meters drilled worldwide. And efficiency, efficiency of our platform, efficiency of our integration capability that we have formed by putting this Well Construction. So, this has an opportunity to solidify our market leadership position and expand and get the benefit of scale. The Reservoir Performance is where we combine our subsurface and our unique service that exploits both in exploration, in development and in production intervention, the power of our service connected to the reservoir and to the unique domain knowledge. So I think here, we have unique technology, a differentiation and unique domain knowledge that when the market will need to extract and be more efficient on existing assets to find the next tieback opportunity, or to exploit an existing asset to the next life extension, we have fantastic reservoir performance technology. And last is Production System. I think here this is a story of growth. This is a story of expanding horizon beyond what we have today, which is from-- and beyond, and into the midstream. This is a story of addressing the gas market opportunity and connecting the well to the subsea to the surface, and creating unique integration, integrated production system with digital as a unique element. So, recovery through Production Systems and Reservoir Performance is what we want to propose to the market.\nConnor Lynagh: All right, that\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you very much, Connor. So, thank you, everyone, for having attended this call. So, before we end this call, I would like to leave you with four key takeaways. Third quarter was another quarter of operational and financial outperformance, made possible by discipline in execution. We made significant progress on the execution of our strategy, with key milestones in restructuring, North America strategy, and expanding the reach of our digital platform. The reset of our earnings power is progressing very well. We anticipate significantly improved operational leverage when we put the trough behind us and activity rebounds, providing us with a platform to materially expand our EBITDA margins and earnings. The quarter was another strong free cash flow performance in the cycle trough, a meaningful step closer to our double-digit free cash flow ambition that will support our priority on deleveraging our balance sheet. Lastly, the deployment of our new customer-focused organization and our fit-for-basin approach provide us with a great platform to capitalize on the market recovery and deliver on this path. In conclusion, we are executing our performance strategy and our determined to continue taking bold actions to secure resilience and reposition ourselves as clear leaders\u2014both in performance measured by our customers and in returns measured by our shareholders. Thank you.\nND Maduemezia: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our call. Operator, you may now disconnect.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference Service. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Olivier, and good morning ladies and gentlemen. Third-quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.16. This represents an increase of $0.11 sequentially and a decrease of $0.27 when compared to the same quarter of last year. During the quarter, we recorded $350 million of pretax restructuring charges. These charges primarily relate to facility exit costs, as we continue to rationalize our real estate footprint. As a result of these charges, our pretax operating income will increase by approximately $15 million per quarter going forward due to reduced lease and depreciation expenses. Overall, our third-quarter revenue of $5.3 billion decreased 2% sequentially. Pretax segment operating margins increased 355 basis points to 10.9%. More importantly, company-wide adjusted EBITDA margins increased 371 basis points to 19.4%. As a reminder, our full-year 2019 adjusted EBITDA margin was 20.2%. In other words, we are well on our way to restoring our precrisis EBITDA margins of 2019, despite the severe revenue reduction we have experienced. This will be achieved through the combination of our restructuring actions and the high-grading of our portfolio. As a reminder, our restructuring program will permanently remove $1.5 billion of fixed costs on an annual basis. We have achieved more than 80% of these cash savings as of the end of the third quarter. We expect to complete most of the remaining actions as we exit the fourth quarter. As it relates to the high-grading of our portfolio, we achieved two significant milestones this quarter with the signing of an agreement to divest our North American low-flow artificial lift business in a cash transaction, followed by an agreement to contribute our OneStim\u00ae pressure pumping business to Liberty Oilfield Services in exchange for a 37% equity interest in Liberty. We received antitrust clearance for both transactions and we anticipate each of the closings to occur before the end of the year. It is worth noting that both transactions will be accretive to our earnings in 2021. Let me now go through the third quarter results for each segment. Third-quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $1 billion decreased 4% sequentially, while margins decreased 90 basis points to 16.7%. These decreases were primarily due to lower sales of WesternGeco multiclient seismic licenses in North America offshore. Drilling revenue of $1.5 billion decreased 12% sequentially while margins were essentially flat at 9.5%. The revenue decrease was driven by an activity decline in US land where the rig count dropped significantly combined with COVID disruptions and customer budget adjustments in several international GeoMarkets. Despite the revenue drop, margins were resilient as a result of cost reduction measures. Production revenue of $1.8 billion increased 12% sequentially and margins increased 11 percentage points to 12.6%. These increases were largely the result of a resumption of activity in our APS projects in Ecuador, following last quarter's production interruption caused by a major landslide. OneStim also increased on higher fleet utilization, while profitability improved across each of our Completions, Artificial Lift, and Well Services product lines due to cost reduction measures. Cameron revenue of $1 billion decreased 5% while margins decreased by 162 basis points to 6.3% on lower OneSubsea\u00ae revenue in Asia and Europe, as well as lower Surface Systems equipment sales in North America. Now turning to our liquidity. I was again very pleased with our cash flow generation. During the quarter, we generated $479 million of cash flow from operations and $226 million of free cash flow, despite making $273 million of severance payments. This performance confirms that our cash flow generation capabilities remain intact. As a result, we will generate excess cash once our restructuring efforts are complete and, therefore, be in a position to deleverage the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with total cash and investments of $3.8 billion. Our net debt at the end of the quarter was$13.9 billion, an increase of $149 million compared to last quarter, but down almost half a billion when compared to the same time last year. During the quarter, we spent $200 million on CapEx and invested $28 million in APS projects. Our total capital spend for 2020, including APS and multiclient, is still expected to be approximately $1.5 billion. This represents 45% decrease as compared to 2019, mostly coming from lower CapEx in North America and reduced investments in APS projects. We took further steps to strengthen the balance sheet during the quarter. We issued $500 million of 1.400% Notes due 2025. The proceeds will be used to repay 2.200% Notes that mature in November. We also issued 350 million of 2.650% Notes due 2030. The proceeds were used to pay down commercial paper borrowings. Finally, we ended the quarter with available liquidity of $10.8 billion. Before I conclude, and just as a reminder, due to our corporate reorganization we will report our results on the basis of the four new Divisions starting in the fourth quarter. We are working to provide historical restated financial information based upon the new Division structure and expect to publish this in November. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier. Yes, sure, Angie. We are actually progressing quite well on our integration planning. The good news, we are identifying, through this process, additional synergies and opportunities for our technology collaboration that makes this combination even more compelling than we initially contemplated. So we are quite happy with partnering with Liberty. We believe there's quite a lot of upside potential in the combined company as the company -- as the synergies are realized and the market starts to recover. So we will benefit from the North American unconventional recovery as our equity stake will continue to appreciate and we will also leverage our technology alliance with Liberty. So, it is premature in that context to talk about monetization, considering where we stand in the cycle. But that will, of course, remain an option over the longer term. We have not set a timeline for this. We have not set a target price. But it will always remain an option. In terms of accretion, we've stated it will be accretive from day one. So, going into 2021, it will be positive for sure on our EPS, EBITDA and margins overall. Yes, I'll take this, Chris. There is -- yes, we were above -- quite a bit above 80%. So, there is a bit left. There will be still a bit left going into Q1. It is mostly on the international, the tail end of it. And North America is mostly complete. So, you will see a bit more push from this in Q4, but some remainder are going into the first half next year. Does this answer your question? Yes. It's not an exact science there, to be honest. The cash outlays, they get spread out. It could be a little bit higher in the fourth quarter. However, the cash flow from operations, traditionally in the fourth quarter, also increases. So, I think we could very well end up with free cash flow, including severance, still quite positive. And if everything goes well, it could even be higher than in Q3, even though we have higher severance potentially."

            "name": "Olivier Le Peuch",
            "content": "Thank you, ND. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning. Thank you for joining us on the call today. In my opening remarks, I would like to focus my commentary on three parts: first, our third-quarter operational and financial performance; next, progress with the implementation of our strategy; and third, our updated view on the near-term business outlook. After this, Stephane will provide greater details on our financial results. In the third quarter, we had an opportunity to demonstrate the significance of the measures we have taken over the last few months and set a marker of outperformance\u2014through top-line resilience, margin expansion, and by maintaining our strong cash generation track record. In an ongoing activity trough, our third-quarter sequential performance was exceptionally strong. Yet again, we continued to maintain benchmarks of safety and service quality in our operations. Sequential margin expansion rebounded by more than 300 basis points for both IBT and EBITDA, and free cash flow was solidly positive. The strength of our margin expansion and free cash flow performance is even more impactful in the context of a slight topline decline and the exceptional items during the quarter. I would like to thank the entire Schlumberger team for this remarkable performance and for excellence in execution. These results represent a defining step in the reset of our earnings power at the trough of the cycle and set the stage for our long-term outperformance. Starting with operations, in the third quarter, we maintained benchmark integrity performance, with year-over-year improvements at 30% in HSE incident frequency and 34% in reliability. Operations integrity remains an area of strength for Schlumberger and the foundation of our performance strategy; our consistent service delivery earned several letters of commendation from our customers and is the basis of multiple new contract awards recorded in the quarter. Financially, we posted higher sequential pretax operating margins, more than 20% EBITDA growth and positive free cash flow\u2014despite the severance payments and reduced working capital release versus the prior quarter. These results clearly set us on the path to our intermediate goal of restoring 2019 EBITDA margins before the end of 2021. Now, let me turn to our strategy. First, our restructuring program is progressing well and we are on track to realize most of our permanent structural cost savings as we exit this year. We also began the transition to our leaner customer-aligned structure comprised of Divisions and Basins, designed to support the basin-specific innovation that will solidify Schlumberger's position as the performance partner of choice. Next, in North America, we achieved key milestones on our scale-to-fit strategy with two transactions that advance the high-grading of our portfolio, while lowering capital intensity and volatility\u2014the Liberty transaction and the low-flow divestiture. The closing of these transactions will not only enhance our EBITDA margin at the global level but will further support lower capital intensity and an accelerated path to our financial goals for North America. Looking ahead at the benefits of this strategy execution, we are set to significantly improve the company's future operating leverage. And as the market activity recovers from the current trough, we have the potential to restore EBITDA to the 2019 mark of $6.6 billion by recovering only half of the year-on-year revenue decline. Our performance strategy also focuses on new horizons of growth, which includes Digital and Production & Recovery. The industry is rapidly embracing digital enablement and shifting capital investment toward maximizing production and recovery from existing assets. Where these two industry shifts converge in essence, where digital intersects with production and recovery, Schlumberger has a unique opportunity to deploy the full power of our industry digital platform and domain expertise, spanning reservoir and production for the benefit of our customers. The best example of this was the application of our Agora* edge AI and IoT solutions on our APS project in Ecuador. By connecting field equipment to the cloud and running predictive AI at the edge, we boosted production 30% on Agora-connected wells while significantly reducing field crew visits to these wells and, as such, cutting HSE exposure and environmental impacts. This created revenue and margin on an APS project where we captured the value directly, and is just an example of what is possible at scale when we use the power of the industry digital platform to blend hardware and software to enable people\u2014wherever they are located\u2014to make performance impacts with digital. In addition, we continued to expand the reach of our digital platform, as demonstrated by the IBM Red Hat OpenShift agreement, further enabling adoption of our platform around the world, and particularly, with NOCs. In the quarter, we have also secured notable subsea and artificial lift contracts in the Gulf of Mexico and in the Middle East, which will result in the growth of our installed base and greater exposure to Production & Recovery CapEx and OpEx\u2014a strong platform for the future. Finally, we continue to develop our New Energy portfolio with progress in our hydrogen technology venture, Genvia, and the creation of a geothermal project development company, which complements our low-heat geothermal venture, Celsius Energy. These exciting ventures represent a mix of unique opportunities for Schlumberger to create a differentiated market position through the energy transition. In parallel, we continue to develop avenues to contribute to the decarbonization of oil and gas operations, leveraging our technology, expertise, and execution platform to reduce our environmental impact while helping our customers reach their environmental goals. Let me take a few moments now to talk about the outlook. In the short- to mid-term horizon, the market uncertainties persist as the economic recovery remains fragile. The pace of demand recovery could possibly slow or pause as a result of a second wave of pandemic outbreaks or heightened pandemic control measures. Similarly to the third quarter, we also face risks of lingering COVID-19 operational disruptions internationally as we enter the winter season. In this context, we will continue to focus on what we can control and react promptly if necessary. Now, absent of a pause in demand recovery or higher COVID-19 disruption, the fourth quarter activity will likely extend the trends experienced as we close the third quarter, with the continuation of a modest activity uptake in North America and the stabilization towards a steady activity internationally\u2014albeit with visible seasonal variations, the combination of which resulting into an about flat outlook overall for the quarter. Looking out further, the prevailing uncertainties make it much too early to call. However, directionally, and absent of a slowdown in the pace of economic recovery, we anticipate the overall activity to consolidate gradually during 2021. In line with the most recent IEA projections, we see that the conditions still exist to rebalance demand and supply with improving demand recovery supported by economic stimulus measures and continued supply discipline from the major producers, ultimately resulting into a visible activity rebound. North America land is expected to continue its subdued recovery in frac and drilling activity towards production maintenance levels. Internationally, as demand recovers, a pull on short-cycle supply will result in an activity inflection, this being anticipated by most operators currently evaluating options to restore activity. Having shared our view on the outlook, let me now hand over to Stephane who will talk more about our financial results. Thank you, Stephane. Ladies and gentlemen, I think we are ready to open the call for the questions. Great question, James. So thanks again. Indeed, we are set to continue to execute our strategy for improving our return above cost of capital. That's the foundation, okay. And we'll do that in several ways, cash flow, margins and discipline on capital, obviously. So you have seen that we have not wasted the crisis, as we could say, taking the opportunity to restructure our organization to reset to the new -- what we expect in normal. And I think we have done that in anticipating that the market will be structurally smaller, albeit it will be defined by new attributes. One of them is the basin attributes where we believe regionalization will become more critical, hence the creation of our Basin structure to support our clients in the basin to outperform in every basin, and that's the fit-for-basin strategy that is in light there. The second, obviously, transition is digital. I think digital is happening everywhere, in the office, in operation, in all aspects of our workflows, and we believe that this is a transformative step that we are ready to support. And last, I would say at a very high level, I believe that Production & Recovery will become more critical going forward as the mature assets will have to be -- the return on mature assets will have to be improved. And at the same time, energy transition from gas technology up to midstream as well as transition to new energy. I think this will give us the digital, the production recovery, the energy transition starting with gas, will give us the element of growth that will then leverage our new operating platform with the division basin as you have seen restructured to give us the opportunity to much expand our margins and reach and exceed our return above cost of capital. That's what we are set to achieving, James. I think there are three elements. I think the first and foremost and the one that have the most impact to date in our quarter results is the restructuring we have done when we adjusted our permanent structure and variable costs to the new normal and to the new level of activity as we foresee. And I think this has a significant amplifying impact on our return to margin expansion. So the second factor is a continuation of our strategic action in North America that aims at high-grading our portfolio and taking step to make sure that we retain and continue to invest in portfolio where we believe we can differentiate and create return above our threshold. And third is the leverage of our international footprint. So when you combine the core [inaudible] and structural adjustments that we have done to lift and reset our earnings power, the action we have taken to enhance significantly our margins in North America, our play in North America and international mix leverage, all of this will combine to elevate and gradually build our EBITDA margin to the 20% of EBITDA of 2019. And we don't need much growth to achieve this. Okay, a comprehensive question, Angie. Thank you. So first on digital, is it accretive? Absolutely. It's accretive today. It's accretive tomorrow. I think it will be accretive in the future, at a step that is certainly pulling our margins up. And I think what we are looking for to accelerate is our growth CAGR, so that it is accretive not in the future at a larger scale. So digital is and will be accretive on the way forward. Absolutely. The second question you asked is on the EBITDA of 2019, if I understand correctly, what you asked for, Angie, to reiterate. So yes, I think we are clear on our ability to deliver this EBITDA margin improvement to 20% above in the short term. And the mix we need, as I said and commented with James, is very clear. It's a combination of international, our restructuring and the international exposure that we have that are greatly accretive to this. Finally, you asked a question about when and how we will go beyond this. Our mid-cycle margin ambition is above that level. We are at a trough, at operating already very close to this 2019, having operated-- or reset of our margins. Our expectation is continuing to grow and expand, again, building our international franchise, building and accelerating our digital and being the full proof on this, but also continue to execute on our capital discipline, capital stewardship that will high grade our portfolio and will resolve some of the still outstanding underperforming business units. So, you combine growth internationally, the power of digital and our discipline on capital stewardship and addressing our underperforming contract, you have the recipe to expand the margin beyond this 20%. And you can make the math. I think we would expect indeed that with half the revenue coming back from 2019, we will expect to be in a position to reach or exceed this dollar EBITDA contribution. So, I think when is this happening, some time in the future, not 2021 clearly. 2022 will be the beginning of a cycle of international expansion, that's very likely. And after that, there will be some time but we believe this is in sight and that's what we are working to towards. I'll let Stephane answer some, and I will answer on the customer engagement. Please, Stephane, on the transaction. Yes, I can only reinforce that I think our value proposition, the value proposition of Liberty on the market with our existing customer, I think, is undoubtful very strong with this platform, as you pure play-- the largest pure-play frac company. But we are putting in place the contract and service-level agreements across both companies to cross-license technology and to create pull-through so that we can extend the Liberty workflow and the value proposition of well site, and we can pull them on some of the contract we have on well construction, over contract to where we participate across and around the frac operation. So clearly, for both the -- beneficiary on both. I think first and foremost, our strategy will evolve around a digital platform, establishing a digital platform for industry, both from the -- in the geoscience subsurface side, building on our desktop offering today and building up on our market strengths and establishing with what we did with OSDU, an open-platform foundation with data ecosystem shared with the industry and offering industry as the foundation for this. So we believe that this transition to the cloud will cement our desktop leadership position we have today and expand and create growth opportunity with new transition similar to the Chevron, similar to the Suncor, similar to the Woodside transition that we are doing with the DELFI core expanding into the cloud. So this alone is a growth avenue. The second one is digital operation, as I will call it. And I think it extends DELFI to the drilling or to the production space. But also, we have been extending and using the concept of digital platform to also introduce what we call Agora, a gateway and a platform that offers opportunity to plug AI or edge application on equipment. And I think you have seen two examples of which we described into the press release earlier today and I think this is an expansion. So that's the second axis of expanding beyond the core or beyond geosciences and expanding into operation. And the third, I think, is the domain of AI and of offering services for our customers to extract more from their workflow across and using an element of our platform, not necessarily the application but using the platform as a basis for creating value to their own IP, to their own integration capability and where we act as a system integrator and we act as a support for their workflow. So these are the avenue of growth. So we'll continue to make partnership as a basis for building these platform stacks. And we will, and when as appropriate, we believe that we have -- if we believe we have gaps into our offering and in operation, or in geosciences or in AI, we will make bolt-on acquisition, as we'll call it, to supplement or to complement this so that we better respond to this and expand in New Energy or expand into the gas midstream, for example, using the same platform. So first, Agora. Simply said, Agora brings us ability to bring on every piece of equipment on the platform, on the rig, an ability to connect this piece of equipment to the cloud and to our platform and yet offering at this point, at this edge, an open platform where partners can provide and can plug their application, AI application typically, that will add value to this data feed. The perfect example is what you have seen on the PETRONAS application, where we have not been developing this video spacing analysis tool. One of our partners have just deployed their video tool on to our platform and connected to the camera and we served as a gateway back to the cloud. So we just provide a platform that our customer are licensing and installing on their equipment. And then their own partners, our partners, are creating value with AI routines or AI application at the edge that connects to the cloud. That's what people like in a secure way. Red Hat Openshift, simply said, is an ability to provide multiplicity of options for cloud deployment for our customers that offer hybrid cloud deployments on-premise and public and address the concern that some of our customers in some countries were facing that they cannot export their data to the public cloud, because it is -- data is present -- data residency issue, or they believe they need to control and have in-house premise cloud infrastructure. For these two solutions, we provide through OpenShift an ability to deploy DELFI on on-premise cloud infrastructure or on cloud that are not public cloud, hence addressing a market that we cannot address today. It's about 50% of the market today, 50% of the country that don't have or do not prefer to use public cloud for their hosting their data that we're unlocking through this. So, we are unlocking a significant part of market. I think, obviously, we see it's not only a trend that we want to capture with our existing customers. I think, obviously, some of our customer segments are transitioning into a different role as energy company and want to add to that portfolio beyond oil and gas, including some technology and some renewables in which we also have interest. And I think at large, what we have realized is that we have a technology platform. We have an ability to deploy at scale technology. We have a subsurface knowledge. When you combine all of this, we believe that we have market position that we can take, develop into the New Energy business, be it on renewable, be it on the energy storage or be it on hydrogen. And I think this is where we are developing our venture today. We are developing it in geothermal, both low-heat and deep geothermal. That's very adjacent to our business because it exploits our subsurface knowledge, our drilling, well construction, and our ability to manage heat flows from subsurface to surface and provide digital platform to control it. So that's where we're heading. The hydrogen is very, very interesting for us because it's a huge opportunity, partially led by EU, with Green Deal and there are two avenues there. One avenue is the green hydrogen or electrolyzer where we believe we, with our new venture, Genvia, are in a position to create differentiated offering in the market to provide the market with higher efficiency and more versatile electrolyzer that can feed this 40-gigawatt capacity that EU is planning for 2030. And finally, I think we will continue to also look into CCS, which is again close to our core. But not CCS application for oil and gas, but CCS application to decarbonize the hard-to-abate sector, ammonia or SMR for hydrogen production through gas. And these are the sector that outside of our oil and gas customer, that's where we believe we can add value. And when you combine all of this, this is a very exciting future with New Energy, and we are taking position today for the long run. Yes. I think what we see is that, clearly, I think the level of investment that's currently going into international is not sustainable, I think for two reason. I think that the demand/supply will rebalance and will create a pull on supply worldwide, and I think this will be pulling on international as well as the U.S. The North America has suffered from a setback that is creating a gap in the future supply. [Technical Difficulty] So I think short cycle is set to come back first, and then long cycle. The timing of this and the magnitude, I think, will depend on the -- obviously, on the demand -- oil demand pace, recovery pace. But what we can say is that customers are already engaging and are asking us to be ready for mobilization, be it in short or midterm, to make sure that we're not getting in the wrong direction to cut capacity beyond what they will need in the short to mid-term. So, I will expect the low-cost producer country on the core of OPEC plus to be the first to react and to rebound when the market will be there. So that includes Middle East, that includes Russia, obviously. Beyond that, I think we will see short cycle everywhere. China will continue to be executing on their energy strategy, so I don't expect this to be slowing down. And then we will see gradually infield drilling. We will see the shallow water coming back. And there's a lot of FID ready to be approved that will then accelerate back to the border. So, I think there will be a sequence in this, but short-cycle will come back, both onshore and offshore, and will come back certainly sometime in 2021 and clearly, in 2022. Yes, absolutely. I think it's too early to quote a number. I think it's something that we are working, and we are continuing to develop our strategy. But I think I will not call it renewable. I think it's more than renewable. And it's not--intersects renewable, but I think it's the technology approach we have and it's not necessarily -- don't expect us to buy wind farms and go after capital projects. So that's not our intent. Our intent is to continue to play and build on our strengths, strength being our technology, being a technology partner for a renewable company, being technology partner for some of our current existing customers and being technology partner for addressing a new economy, such as hydrogen economy. I think this is where we want to be. Obviously, I want this to be meaningful. I want to be at scale in the next decade for sure, because I think at that time, we want to be in a position where we believe we will be diversifying our portfolio and building and leveraging the growth that is existing in these to make sure that we are having a diversified portfolio, but still a technology portfolio and a service and technology offering with solution to this market. So again, it's a long-term ambition with short-term investments that are helping us to create market position that are unique, that will gradually being reinforced. And we'll take a bigger position on the one we believe have the most potential in the coming years. No. First, the way we define it is a full-year target we are taking. It will happen before the end of 2021. We believe the trajectory of the year with a gradual recovery will give us the opportunity to create a full year target that will be set at this level, or exceed. Do we anticipate and see more pricing? No. I think the pricing has been -- the pricing pressure has been with us for the last six years. I think, as I commented before, I think we have been giving away and the industry at large have been under pressure for this. The industry now is realizing that there's so much we can give, and we are working more collaboratively with our customers to find solutions to eliminate waste. Now obviously, large integrated contracts are still competitively priced, but we see that through performance, through technology, and through smart engagement and alignment with our customer, we're able to offset those pricing and competitive pressure and realize margin resilience. So pricing is and will remain with us in these years to come, possible headwinds but mostly on large integrated contracts. And I believe that when activity will come back, we'll get opportunity to get back pricing in the right market. Yes, that's a correct assumption. And I think we believe that what will happen is that the market will consolidate around basin's position that each of the major and large independent will concentrate on their basin plays and other strengths. And we-- I believe that we have to be smart about aligning with our customers in those key basins, be it around their core assets, such as Exxon in Guyana, such as some other IOCs in Brazil or in East Africa. We will make sure that we align ourselves with those so that we maximize the uptake of market position in those basins and continue to execute our fit-for-basin and engagement with customers to make sure we maximize those position. So that's the first thing we want to do. Next, I will comment that the national oil company are part of the mix, and I think the deepwater is indeed more domain where international companies dominate. And I think we have there a very strong position. But from shallow to land, there is a lot of activity that is pulled, both short and long cycle, by national company. And in Middle East, most of the offshore activity, if not all of the offshore activity, is led by national oil company and is growing fairly well and has been more resilient than the land activity. So we will hold on those positions and make sure we continue, as we have seen some contracts have been awarded in this domain continue to post this. So we understand that the market will be structurally different than what we could have anticipated five years ago. But we believe that the position around key basins of strength from our customers and aligning ourselves with this will provide us the opportunity to capture most of this international growth coming back. I think the comment I will offer on this is that this market is a market where the exploration market sits. And the exploration market is set from discretionary spend and it includes the multi-cloud sales that historically have been a little bit of a swing that depends on the season and depends also on the exploration discretionary budget that is available for our customers to invest in future exploration acreage. So that has left a little bit of variability. The variability has been bigger in recent times because the proportionate scale of exploration has reduced. Hence, when exploration campaign comes back, which happens every other season, and when the discretionary spend on exploration through multi clients this combines to create a very strong quarter. But at the base, the related testing, wire line and digital are still performing very well. Software was growing this quarter, one of the very few product line that did grow quarter-on-quarter and did grow as an example. So, expect this to be the consequence of most of the exposure we have on discretionary exploration spend and the exploration campaign viability that we see quarter-on-quarter. This is the most of the rationale for this more than any core issue we will have in any of the product lines that are there. Now commenting on the future, we will not comment anymore on Reservoir Characterization, as we'll comment on the new Divisions that we are setting in place. And part of it will be in digital, part of it will be in Reservoir Performance Division. So, you will get more detail on this in the coming months. That's a fair assumption. I think we have some favorable and unfavorable play that we believe will balance out, and the ambition will be indeed to maintain roughly both the margins and the dollar, on an all about flat. Stephane? I think the way you look at -- we look at it, is to look at the current level of activity. And we use more or less the second half of this year as a baseline. Because I think the reset for international oil company has happened in the second quarter, for independent has happened in the second and the third and for national oil company has happened in the third. So, the reset of activity has happened in the last six months. Now we believe that we have stabilized, and we have seen it in the last few weeks, and we don't believe that, aside from seasonal impact, we don't believe that there will be structural adjustment in the short term. And that's our baseline. So, from that baseline, we will anticipate this to get an upside from that baseline and to gradually recover from that baseline [of work]. Now to compare it year-on-year, including the first quarter of this year up to the mix international second quarter, including the significant effort in Middle East to increase supply early Q2, I don't think it's realistic. We have to take a baseline of the second half of this year and project forward. And from that base build back a recovery. I think we'll continue to focus on each and every business line we have operating in North America. We have already made effort to rationalize and to make sure that we operate in the basin of North America, where we believe we can sustain a differentiation and participate fully going forward. We have made a choice to accelerate some technology access and fit-for-basin in some part of our portfolio to high-grade their performance. So, I will say that all of our portfolio the entire business line, I would say, has opportunity to improve their returns by tuning. And I think what we have done on structural reset is lifting. And the business line have improved this quarter beyond OneStim, the performance of North America business line this quarter have improved. So, we have a way to go to further improve this and to target our recovery of margin in North America. And I will say that we do that on both the growth for the market where we have strong alignment, the well construction, the production recovery, the digital and we do that on the bottom line, where we continue to use technology access or restructuring to make sure that we execute with the return we desire in this North America. So, we'll continue to gradually improve the performance, that's our goal. I will not comment on that. I think we continue to look at every portfolio and we look at it from the light of does it bring us the growth and accretive return opportunity in the long run, or do we have a better way to monetize and to be occasionally opportunistic about this portfolio? So this is true for those portfolio there and as well as in other markets. But we'll continue to look at it and we will be disciplined to making the right decision for the shareholder here. No, setting aside D&I, which have both a margin expansion opportunity and growth on the back of digital, indeed, I think we can look at it from Well Construction, where we believe that our market position will benefit from the return of meters drilled worldwide. And efficiency, efficiency of our platform, efficiency of our integration capability that we have formed by putting this Well Construction. So, this has an opportunity to solidify our market leadership position and expand and get the benefit of scale. The Reservoir Performance is where we combine our subsurface and our unique service that exploits both in exploration, in development and in production intervention, the power of our service connected to the reservoir and to the unique domain knowledge. So I think here, we have unique technology, a differentiation and unique domain knowledge that when the market will need to extract and be more efficient on existing assets to find the next tieback opportunity, or to exploit an existing asset to the next life extension, we have fantastic reservoir performance technology. And last is Production System. I think here this is a story of growth. This is a story of expanding horizon beyond what we have today, which is from-- and beyond, and into the midstream. This is a story of addressing the gas market opportunity and connecting the well to the subsea to the surface, and creating unique integration, integrated production system with digital as a unique element. So, recovery through Production Systems and Reservoir Performance is what we want to propose to the market. Thank you very much, Connor. So, thank you, everyone, for having attended this call. So, before we end this call, I would like to leave you with four key takeaways. Third quarter was another quarter of operational and financial outperformance, made possible by discipline in execution. We made significant progress on the execution of our strategy, with key milestones in restructuring, North America strategy, and expanding the reach of our digital platform. The reset of our earnings power is progressing very well. We anticipate significantly improved operational leverage when we put the trough behind us and activity rebounds, providing us with a platform to materially expand our EBITDA margins and earnings. The quarter was another strong free cash flow performance in the cycle trough, a meaningful step closer to our double-digit free cash flow ambition that will support our priority on deleveraging our balance sheet. Lastly, the deployment of our new customer-focused organization and our fit-for-basin approach provide us with a great platform to capitalize on the market recovery and deliver on this path. In conclusion, we are executing our performance strategy and our determined to continue taking bold actions to secure resilience and reposition ourselves as clear leaders\u2014both in performance measured by our customers and in returns measured by our shareholders. Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Schlumberger Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, there will be an opportunity for your questions. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Simon Farrant. Please go ahead.\nSimon Farrant: Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited Second-Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. Today's call is being hosted from Houston following the Schlumberger Limited Board meeting held earlier this week. Joining us on the call are Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Executive Officer; and Stephane Biguet, Chief Financial Officer. For today's agenda, Olivier will start the call with his perspectives on the quarter and our updated view of the industry macro, after which, Stephane will give more details on our financial results. Then we will open up to your questions. As always, before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind the participants that some of the statements we'll be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I, therefore, refer you to our latest 10-K filing and our other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our second-quarter press release, which is on our website. Now, I'll turn the call over to Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Simon, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you all for joining us on the call. Today, in my prepared remarks, I would like first to review the company\u2019s performance during the second quarter, then offer commentary on the short-term outlook, and finally reflect on where we stand in our performance strategy vision. As we close one of the most difficult quarters in our industry, I want first to thank the women and men of Schlumberger for their resilience, performance, and dedication during these unique circumstances and express my pride not only in what we have achieved, but also in what we contributed for the health of the communities where we work and live. Reflecting on the quarter\u2019s performance, I would like to comment on four key attributes that clearly made this quarter unique in its achievements: operational performance, margins, cash and liquidity, and digital. First, our operational performance supported our best-ever safety and service quality performance on record. Indeed, our frequency of safety incidents reduced nearly 50% from a year ago, whilst our service quality improved nearly 40% year-on-year\u2014to reach a new benchmark in integrity performance for our customers. This is an attribute of our performance vision that is becoming a clear differentiator in execution, and very well acknowledged by our customers. Second is the strength of our operating margins\u2014with 18% decremental margins despite the most severe and abrupt activity drop. These margins resulted primarily from the combination of swift actions on variable costs and the decision to accelerate the restructure of the company. This new organizational structure of four divisions aligned with our customers\u2019 key workflow and five key basins of activity, is significantly leaner and more responsive, adapted to the new industry normal, and strategically aligned with our performance vision. Internationally, the impact of these decisive actions also combined with progress on our capital stewardship program and continued industry adoption of new technology, particularly reservoir evaluation and digital solutions. As a consequence, the margins of our international franchise remained remarkably resilient, flat sequentially, despite the material revenue contraction and the adverse margin impact from the major disruption in Ecuador. As outlined in the earnings release, the majority of our GeoMarkets and three out of four business segments either expanded or maintained margins internationally, clearly demonstrating the strength of our franchise and the resilience of our earnings power. In North America, we accelerated the restructuring initiated last year with emphasis on scale-to-fit and the asset-light business model with significant permanent reductions to fixed and infrastructure costs. At this point, we have shutdown about 150 of our facilities and continue to make progress on the technology access franchise. In short, we readied the business for a market of smaller scale and lower-growth outlook, but with higher returns. Third, the cash flow performance was extremely solid during the quarter, building on very strong cash flow from operations and leveraging the aggressive reduction of our capital spending. In fact, cash flow was still strong even when excluding working capital and accounting for the significant negative impact of severance payments during the quarter. Similarly, the liquidity position of the company significantly improved during Q2, while debt was visibly lower year-over-year. The attention to liquidity and cash preservation has been a very clear focus for the entire management team and finance function during the last several months, and I\u2019m quite satisfied to have navigated this very difficult quarter with such a positive outcome. Finally, the adoption of digital, both internally and externally, is becoming a major - factor of performance and was very impactful during the second quarter operationally and financially. Internally, we made significant improvement in the deployment of digital operations particularly remote operations and digital inspections, as the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions created a catalyst for further adoption. Our drilling remote operations expanded over 25% during the quarter to exceed two-thirds of our drilling activity. We have drilled 1,250 wells in Q2 using our remote operations capability, supported by more than 250 remote operations engineers. In addition, we are now performing over 1,000 digital inspections per week, applied to maintenance, manufacturing, or integration applications across more than 40 countries, leveraging our digital backbone infrastructure. Therefore during the quarter, digital operations had a magnifying impact lowering the cost of service delivery, the size of operating crews, and increasing efficiency across operations lifecycle, hence contributing to our operating margins. Externally, we saw greater adoption of our open digital platform for both subsurface and operations solutions. The diversity and depth of digital solutions deployed with our customers, as described in several examples in our earnings release, reflects the growing maturity of the digital transformation in our industry and the success of our DELFI platform. We are extremely proud to be associated with ExxonMobil for the deployment of DrillPlan and DrillOps digital solutions to transform drilling planning and operations including automation. We share the same vision for the future of our industry, with ambition to deliver faster and lower-cost wells through digital technology. As digitalization is accelerating, we are also seeing continued progress in technology adoption despite the challenging context, as fit-for-basin and performance-focused technology generate significant efficiency gains for our customers. All in all, this quarter promised to be messy from an activity outlook, and it certainly was. However, the performance and resilience of our team, our decisive actions to preserve cash and margins, and the continued execution of our strategy, including digital, have delivered a very strong outcome, resetting the company\u2019s competitiveness, and enabling us to operate with resilient margins in a structurally smaller market. Now let me turn to the short-term outlook. Given the uncertainties regarding the pace of economic and oil demand recovery, the range of activity outcomes for the second half of the year is still wide. However, with what we know and see today, we expect the global activity decline to recede into a soft landing in the coming months, absent further negative impact from COVID-19 on economic recovery or escalating rig activity disruptions. In the North America market, there is an uptick of DUC completions activity in the U.S., contrasted by the slow, but continued decline on both land and offshore rig activity. The frac rebound is expected to last until the seasonal decline at year-end, provided commodity pricing remains stable. International activity outlook appears mixed due to seasonal effect across the different basins. However, it\u2019s still indicative of slight sequential contraction - for drilling activity during Q3, particularly for deepwater and exploration. With this combined North America and international activity outlook and based on our position in the respective markets, we anticipate revenue to remain essentially flat sequentially on a global basis, with a slight positive uptick internationally, offset by flat- to low-single-digit decline in North America. In this context, and absent of any new setback due to COVID-19, we expect EBITDA and operating income to grow and the respective margins to expand during Q3, above and beyond the positive impact of impairment charges. These margins will benefit from the combination of incremental restructuring cost savings during the second half of the year, tailwind from the recovery of activity in Ecuador, and continued execution of our capital stewardship strategy. While we continue to navigate the trough of this cycle, we are actually setting an inflection point in our margins\u2019 performance, ahead of the recovery and despite the backdrop of a significantly smaller market size. Cash flow performance in the coming quarter will continue to benefit from the tailwind of our aggressive capital spend adjustment, focus on working capital efficiency, and incremental cash savings from our restructuring program. Our ambition in the second half remains positive free cash flow despite anticipated severance payments. Put another way, in a flattening activity outlook for the next two or three quarters, our ambition is to execute on a path of visible margin recovery and robust free cash flow generation as we transition into 2021. We embarked on a new strategy less than one year ago, but market conditions created a catalyst to accelerate the restructuring of the company to align with our performance vision. The early results of this strategic execution are already visible in our operational performance, our financial results, and in the alignment with the new industry landscape. Our mid to long-term financial targets remain intact and clearly focused on returns. I believe that the steps accomplished during the quarter not only solidify our vision, but also created a clear path to restore margins and returns performance despite a structurally smaller market. And now I will hand the call to Stephane, who will discuss Q2 financials and the impact of our cost-out program in a bit more detail.\nStephane Biguet: Thank you, Olivier. Good morning ladies and gentlemen and thank you for participating in this conference call. Second quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits was $0.05. This represents a decrease of $0.20 sequentially and $0.30 when compared to the same quarter of last year. During the quarter, we recorded $3.7 billion of pretax charges. These charges primarily relate to workforce reductions, the impairment of an APS investment, and excess assets. You can find details of the components in the FAQs at the end of our earnings press release. Other than the $1 billion of severance, the rest of the charges are largely non-cash. The charge relating to severance covers both the permanent fixed-cost reductions we are implementing as part of the Company restructuring as well as the variable headcount reductions we are executing to adjust to the reduced level of activity. It is important to note that these impairments were all recorded as of the end of June. Therefore, our second quarter results did not include any benefit from reduced expenses as a result of these charges. However, going forward, the impact of the Q2 charges will result in reduced depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $80 million on a quarterly basis, while lease expense will be reduced by $25 million. Approximately $70 million of this quarterly pretax reduction will be reflected in the Production segment. The remaining $35 million will be reflected amongst the Characterization, Drilling, and Cameron segments. The quarterly after-tax impact of these reductions is approximately $0.07 in EPS terms. I will now summarize the main drivers of our second-quarter results. Overall, our second-quarter revenue of $5.4 billion decreased 28% sequentially. Pretax segment operating margins decreased 303 basis points to 7.4%. The swift actions we have taken to reduce variable costs combined with the early results of our restructuring and structural cost-reduction efforts resulted in decremental margins of less than 20% both sequentially and year-over-year. As a reminder, our restructuring program will permanently remove $1.5 billion of fixed costs, with more than half relating to our international businesses. For the sake of clarity, let me highlight that these are true cash savings. They do not take into account the reduction in depreciation and amortization expense as a result of impairment charges. We have achieved approximately 40% of this $1.5 billion target in the second quarter. And we aim to complete the large majority of the remainder before the end of the year. This will provide a strong tailwind to our margins in the second half of the year and into 2021. Now looking at our results by business segment, second-quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $1.1 billion decreased 20% sequentially, while margins increased 357 basis points to 7.6% (sic) [17.6%]. The revenue decrease was due to customers curtailing discretionary exploration-related expenditures. However, margins expanded as a result of the implementation of prompt cost reduction measures and the resilience of our digital businesses. The adoption of new Wireline technology also contributed to the margin increase. Drilling revenue of $1.7 billion decreased 24%, while margins fell by 289 basis points to 9.6%. These decreases were primarily driven by a sharp decline in the North America land rig count and COVID-related restrictions in Latin America, Africa, and Europe. Production revenue of $1.6 billion decreased 40% sequentially, and margins fell 630 basis points to 1.5%. These declines were largely a result of a sharp drop in pressure pumping activity in North America land. Additionally, a production interruption in Ecuador that was caused by a major landslide resulted in a revenue reduction this quarter of approximately $100 million in our Asset Performance Solutions or APS business. This had a significant albeit temporary impact on our decremental margins. Largely as a result of this production interruption, partially offset by the effects of the Q2 impairment, we anticipate APS amortization expense will increase by approximately $40 million next quarter. Finally, Cameron revenue of $1 billion decreased 19% while margins decreased by 180 basis points to 7.9% as international margin expansion partially offset the impact of the severe activity decline in North America land. Let me now turn to our liquidity. I was very pleased with our cash flow generation during the second quarter, given the environment we were operating in. We generated $803 million of cash flow from operations and $465 million of free cash flow. Both of these amounts are higher than last quarter, despite making $370 million of severance payments during the second quarter. As a result, we ended the quarter with total cash and investments of $3.6 billion. Our net debt at the end of the quarter was $13.8 billion, an increase of $479 million compared to last quarter, but down almost $1 billion when compared to the same time last year. During the quarter, we spent $251 million on CapEx and invested $61 million in APS projects. Our total capital spend for 2020, including APS and multi-client, will now be approximately $1.5 billion. This represents a 45% decrease as compared to 2019, mostly coming from lower CapEx in North America and reduced investments in APS projects. Our total APS investments for 2020 was revised down to about $300 million. Despite the second quarter being the most challenging quarter in our modern history, we were still able to take steps to further strengthen the balance sheet. We issued \u20ac1 billion of 1.375% notes due 2026, $900 million of 2.65% notes due 2030, and \u20ac1 billion of 2% notes due 2032. By issuing these notes at attractive rates, we were able to retire approximately $1.5 billion of bonds that were coming due in the next four quarters. It also allowed us to pay down existing commercial paper, providing us with additional flexibility. We ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of commercial paper borrowings outstanding. Therefore, after considering the $3.6 billion of cash on hand, as well as $6.2 billion of undrawn credit facilities, we had approximately $9.8 billion of liquidity available to us at the end of the quarter. This represents an increase of $3 billion from where we ended last quarter. In light of this available liquidity and the various actions we have taken during the quarter, our debt maturity profile over the next 24 months is quite manageable. We only have $500 million of bonds coming due in the fourth quarter of this year and another $665 million coming due in the third quarter of 2021. The next maturity after that will only come in August 2022. Before I conclude, let me say a quick word about our financial reporting going forward. The corporate reorganization we are undertaking is a significant exercise that will take some time to fully implement. Therefore, we will continue to report our results for the third quarter consistent with our historical practices. Starting with the fourth quarter, we will report our results on the basis of the four new divisions. We will continue to disclose revenue on a geographic basis quarterly in line with our historical format in other words, split between North America, Latin America, ECA, and the Middle East. Going forward, once a year and in connection with our fourth-quarter and full-year earnings release, we will disclose pretax operating income split between North America and the rest of the world. These margins will include the results of the Cameron businesses. Shortly after we issue our third-quarter earnings release, we will provide historical pro forma financial information based upon the new division structure as well as the annual geographic margins to assist you with your modeling. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yes, thank you. Thank you, Stephane. So I think we are ready to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nJames West: So clearly digital technologies are gaining a lot of traction as the industry accelerates, intensifies its digital journey, and you guys are, of course leading this charge here. Could you perhaps break out how much of your revenue and earnings comes from digital today and what the - what your plans are for that percentage in the future?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Well, thank you, James. So, I think as we commented before, I think, we are not ready to disclose the detail of our revenue and margin contribution, net contribution from the digital business. Suffice to say that I think it has been accretive from the growth. It has been - the segment of our business that has been declining the least in the last quarter. It has been the one that has seen the most expansion of margin as well during the quarter. So, I think it is material to our business. Our ambition remains the same. We want to double this business in the midterm, double its size. And I think we will use for that two avenue - three avenues, the avenues of subsurface digital platform, where we are doing this transition to cloud-based DELFI solution with our customers, and I think we are already seeing a lot of traction into that space. And I think this will give us new revenue stream of IT infrastructure cloud operation in addition to transformation services for every customer that we transition. Secondly, we want to open a new business around data, and be it on the analytics or be it on the subsurface or operational data that we start to offer our platform for data exchange or for trading those data. So, we have introduced GAIA as a platform, and I think we are seeing success through national data rooms, as you have seen in Egypt, and other place in the world. So, I think that's a second new revenue stream that we are developing. And finally, digital operation. I think you have seen recent announcement of the partnership we have with - we have developed with Exxon, and you are about to hear more in the future. We'll continue to lead in this drilling operation as well as production operation with Sensia, our partner, our JV. And I think these are the three revenue streams that we are developing compared to one we had before. So, this will give us the opportunity to expand in multiple facets and not only into the license for subsurface application.\nJames West: Okay, great. That's very helpful. Maybe just a quick follow-up. As we transition to digital, understanding that your costs are lower, but also the customer fees are lower cost, is the ultimate EBITDA dollars, the absolute dollars, are they higher or lower?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think, no doubt, I think with this growth and accretive margin, it would be higher. I think using the benefits - the benefits from digital will also benefit our customer. That's the reason why we are seeing this adoption, because they realize that they extract efficiency, they transform their own operational workflow, and as such, reduce the total cost of the - in the life cycle of the operation. So, we will benefit, they will benefit. We believe, we have the edge. We are ahead of our competitors. And we own the platform that the industry is adopting. So that will give us sustainable differentiation.\nOperator: And our next question is from Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSean Meakim: Olivier, the cost reduction plan is robust. No one doubts, Schlumberger's ability to execute as we saw in the second quarter. As we've discussed in the past, the medium term, you can't really cut your way to prosperity. So it will be great if we could maybe learn more about how you plan to approach the next cycle. Last cycle, the service sector led with discounts to customers, and that was not least the large-cap diversifieds. I'm sure you received the same request this time around. As you're going to execute well on the cost-out program, looking beyond that, how do we defend the top line trajectory of the coming cycle.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yes, Sean. And I think you have to realize that the - compared to the last cycle, I think things have changed. And first and foremost, I think the margins have been reset for the whole industry. The pricing concession have been steep, and we have not recovered from this pricing from the last cycle. So I think first, there is not much that we can give and share. And I think the approach that we are taking with our customers, actually engage collaboratively across the full life cycle of their operation and eliminate waste and focus on engaging to reduce cost of service delivery jointly. And I think we are seeing success in this approach. We are being awarded an expanded scope when we succeed into eliminating costs and eliminating waste across the value chain. So, you will see more of this approach and less of a pricing because the industry doesn't have much to give. And I think our customer realize this. And I think we are working more collaboratively than we had in the last five years on this. And I believe that the margins expansion that we are realizing or the resilience of the margin we are realizing today will be something that we'll be able to keep and build upon as the recovery will start to happen.\nSean Meakim: Thank you for that. I think that makes sense. Then I guess, as we look out what maybe a couple of years away, but at some point, there'll be another large tender that will hit the market. And I think that's probably where the rubber meets the road to some degree. How do you think - how do you think about the competitive dynamics for those large multi-year tenders that have always been kind of the thorn in the side of the sector?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think, the lesson learned from this, I think, is the industry has learned to be capital disciplined. And I think we have learned, all of us. And I think, we have suffered from some of the steps we took as an industry. And I think, the capital discipline that I have seen and that we are using today, I think is very prominent in many place. And I think we have been having a very strict capital stewardship program, where we make a clear choice on the, I would say, allocating capital where we see returns. And as such, we are grading the opportunity that comes our way. And I believe some of our competitors are applying the same approach as the return are not acceptable the way they were and the way they have been at the trough. So I think the capital discipline is something that has changed. And I think expect that the capital discipline will be an element of success in the future. Now this being said, very large tender, very large scope that have a runway for multi-years will be competitive. But I think we'll demonstrate we have the most competitive cost platform to operate those large contracts and we'll be able to retain margins in those conditions.\nOperator: And next we have a question from Angie Sedita with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAngie Sedita: So around your Q3 guidance for EBITDA and operating income to be up, can you share any additional thoughts around magnitude as far as margins and the bottom line? And then the levers within those numbers, how does Ecuador factor into these numbers as it comes back as well as the furlough employees coming back? And any additional thoughts around the APS tariffs in Ecuador given oil prices?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Let me - Angie, let me offer some very qualitative comments, and I will let Stephane add if he believe that we need to add. So first, I don't think we are in a position where we would like to give quantitative guidance on these. I think considering the level of uncertainty in the mix that could, as we have seen in the second quarter, have changed dramatically partly internationally. I don't think I will go further on a quantitative guidance going forward. But I think we are seeing positive and negative. Obviously, on the positive side, we are seeing the fall through, the incremental impact of our restructuring costs that will continue to fall into a tailwind for our margins. We'll also see, obviously, the return of our Ecuador activity, as you have heard, $100 million impact on the top line. That will come back both EBITDA and margins -- and operating margins in the third quarter. And at the same time, I think the execution that we have seen happening on capital stewardship and success of technology, including digital will also be an uplift. Now, this would be partially offset and one of them will be the top line measure that we took, exceptional measure we took during the second quarter, will not be there again. But I think as a mix, you understand that this will lift our margin despite a top line flat.\nStephane Biguet: Just to add, Olivier, maybe one additional factor on top of the incremental fixed cost savings is also that the full quarter effect of the large headcount reductions we executed in Q2. The exit rates of those headcount reduction was much larger than the average. So we'll have that tailwind as well.\nAngie Sedita: And then I mean you really had impressive results in Reservoir Characterization as far as margins. Can you talk a little bit around how much of that was driven by cost cutting versus the impact of digital and maybe even Wireline? And when could we start to see the similar transformation across your other businesses?\nOlivier Le Peuch: No, very good question I think the - first I think Reservoir Characterization is certainly the one that is the least \u2013having the least exposure to North America as a benefit - had a benefit on international. As I did mention, three out of the four business group had flat or expanding margin internationally and that was the case for Reservoir Characterization. Now to be specific, I would say that a little bit more than half, I will say, came from this aggressive action we take on the structure and cost reduction. But I think the other half came from a technology adoption. And technology adoption, Reservoir Evaluation from Wireline with Ora as the platform of service continue to be very, very successful in the campaign of the - even if we have less exploration activity, we are able to deploy this new technology with much success, and it was the highest quarter in terms of revenue for that new technology Ora. And digital, so I will say that, it's a technology success as much and technology adoption success as much as a cost structure. So, the other segment have technology - and I think and we'll continue to succeed as well. So, I'm not worried about our ability to grow margin in every business group. But obviously, we benefited more from the differentiation of our technology in Reservoir Characterization.\nOperator: And our next question is from the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nScott Gruber: Stephane, can you walk through a few of the major cash items over the next few quarters, specifically with regard to working cap? What are your expectations for the size of the traditional second half release? And then what are your expectations for cash severance in the second half? And how does that split between 3Q and 4Q?\nStephane Biguet: Sure, sure, good morning. Look for the second half, we actually expect our cash flow from operations to remain very strong, even if indeed, you're right, the working capital release will not be as large as it was in Q2, because activity - if we assume activity stabilizing, as we said, in the second half. However again, we\u2019ve already shown all fixed-cost cash savings materializing in the rest of the year and the reduced intensity of our capital spend. We think we can still generate positive free cash flow in the second half, despite the additional severance payments that we will incur. And to your question, we think we will incur on most of the remaining severance payments in the second half of the year.\nScott Gruber: And we should think about - is the $1 billion less the $370 million paid in the second quarter in terms of what's remaining for cash severance? Is that the way to think about it?\nStephane Biguet: Yes, you can put a little bit more because we had $200 million of provisions at the end of March as well.\nScott Gruber: Okay. And then just on the cost-out program. You mentioned realizing about 40% of the $1.5 billion during the second quarter. Is that a full quarter impact, or was that realized by quarter end and then just some color on realizing majority of the remainder in the second half? Is that fairly linear, or is it more weighted towards 3Q or 4Q?\nStephane Biguet: So, it is a full quarter impact, meaning that the Q2 results include the 40%, and we exited the quarter actually at a much higher rate. So this is why we have a nice tailwind starting into Q3 and going into Q4 with the remaining 60%. Most of it is - a lot of it is already realized at the end of- or triggered at the end of the quarter.\nOperator: Next, we go to the line of Bill Herbert with Simmons Energy. Please go ahead.\nBill Herbert: So, in a world of record OPEC spare capacity and inventory which can largely meet the rising call on OPEC output over the next two years, how should we think about the uptake for RCG services given the low hanging fruit with regard to monetizing production?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yes, I think the RCG the Reservoir Characterization Group, I think has multiple aspect to it. I think, one is the digital. And I think this one, independently of the trajectory of the recovery of the supply-demand balance will continue to benefit from the digital transformation that is happening in our industry. When it comes to the Wireline, the Testing, the reservoir evaluation aspect, I think you have to look at two aspects; one is first, exploration still is happening and will continue to happen. There were more than 100 wells explored during the offshore during the second quarter, and there will be more than 100 wells, exploration wells in the first quarter. And hence the ability we have, the differentiation and technology with platforms such as Ora will continue to be providing us support and sustain margin in this environment. Secondly, Reservoir Characterization also does characterization for producing reservoir, so that when there is a short-cycle upside of trying to extract more from existing reservoir without exploring. We are applying technology for intervention, we are applying technology for testing of the reservoir, so that we can optimize. And I think we have seen actually more resilience of that Wireline intervention production services during the quarter than on the evaluation services during the last quarter. So, I'm reading this, I'm optimistic and quite reassured that the portfolio we have is well balanced and include for Reservoir Characterization production-related technology that will make a difference as our customer will go back into extracting more from the reservoir and the producing field they have.\nBill Herbert: And then Stephane, with regard to, I guess, depreciation, did you say that Q3, that total depreciation would be down $80 million quarter-on-quarter?\nStephane Biguet: Yes, it will be from the impairment effect. However, you will also see excuse me, you will also see a reversal coming from the Ecuador landslide incident that will partially offset this effect. But from impairment totally - yes, go ahead, Scott.\nBill Herbert: So the net impact, we had $604 million in Q2. Approximately, what do you think the number and the guidance is for Q3?\nStephane Biguet: It is not going to be so far from Q2, if you assume the same revenue levels we have.\nOperator: And our next question is from Kurt Hallead with RBC. Please go ahead.\nKurt Hallead: So Olivier, I was wondering, if you can, potentially give us a little bit more color around what maybe - what you may see happening in terms of business dynamics in the Middle East. There has been a couple other earnings reports from some of your competitors this week. It seems like there is some mixed messages in terms of overall level of activity and I guess, still some discussion around some pricing concession dynamics? So, you gave us some good color on Latin America and kind of what to expect in Ecuador. So just hoping you can give us some of that same kind of color and context on the Middle East?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yes, thank you. So, I think the Middle East activity is seeing indeed a unique mix. The reason for this is that as part of the OPEC plus commitment and the compliance. There were decisions made during the second quarter for several of the national company, operating in Middle East to contain the activity and to reduce activity including rig activity or rigless activity during the third quarter. So, this is impacting several country and in particular, Saudi. So, the number of rigs that the study was operating at beginning of the year compared to where it is operating now, they will be more than 40 rigs down from January to June, and another nine or 12 rig possibly will go down in the third quarter. So, no doubt that there is a decline by the effect of the transition exit rate from Q2, as well as some further contraction of activity in the third quarter. That's true for that country. So depending on the exposure you have in Middle East, it can be significant or it can be offset. In our case, we are offsetting this by gain of activity or share in specifically Qatar and Kuwait. And as such, the overall outlook for us on Middle East is relatively flat on a sequential basis where, indeed, the underlying rig activity sequentially will go down 6% to 7% across the region. But depending on the - so yes, the activity is going down sequentially, no doubt. And it will not be corrected because of the decision of last week OPEC plus agreement to reinstall-- restore the 1.9 million-barrel cut. This was already factored when those activity cuts were decided. And hence, I'm not expecting any impact on this. So, yes, mix down. However, depending on the market exposure we, in our case, are able to hold our top line relatively flat in that context.\nKurt Hallead: That's great. And then my follow-up is you made a reference that given the cost-out dynamics execution and so on that you would expect your operating income margins and EBITDA to improve, obviously in the third quarter. But it seems like there is going to be some built in momentum in the system that could carry you over into the fourth quarter, even if there is some seasonal decline in revenue? So just wanted to kind of test my theory on that to see if that's true, and then as part of that, I was also curious as to what business segment do you think has the best - will show the best improvement in EBITDA margins as you get through the second half of the year?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Good question. I think the first we do confirm that our ambition is to indeed on a flat outlook, absent of a significant setback that would come from a reversal of the pandemic situation. But, and considering the forward looking, there will be some seasonal effect. So, it's very early to give a perspective on the top line evolution from third quarter to fourth quarter. But assuming that the current directional soft lending of activity continues well into the fourth quarter we will expect indeed this benefit to carry through and this margin expansion to be consistent and to still hold both from EBITDA and from the operating margin in the fourth quarter. So that's correct, and I think that - we are supporting this. I don't think we are in a position where we can project, and we want to detail and give guidance on the business segment outlook beyond next quarter. We expect them to indeed solidify and expand margin next quarter. But I think to go beyond that there will be some end-of-year effect that could twist some of the fall through. But overall, on a global basis, at the company level, this is what we're expecting.\nOperator: And next we have a question from the line of David Anderson with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nDavid Anderson: I have a bigger-picture question for you. But I want to ask you, a quick question first on the near-term, particularly on the Middle East. You talked about mix being an issue there, but in terms of the rigs going down, is it mostly oil? I'm just curious if you can just talk about the mix between oil and gas? Is gas still kind of largely maintained there? And secondarily, is there much impact on this on your LSTK contracts at all? You didn't really get into that at all. I'm just wondering if there is any impact there?\nOlivier Le Peuch: So, the first measure during the third quarter - the second quarter have been obviously on oil. However, there have been some side affect on gas because of budget reduction so budget constraints have led to a reduction of activity in gas as well. But what, to be specific, I\u2019m sorry The gas LSTK contract indeed have reduced significantly. I'm not talking about the unconventional, but the conventional gas operation frac coil tubing rigless operation. And this has reduced to a new floor and this will possibly rebound. But yes, gas was affected for us the drilling LSTK by contract was unaffected. Probably because the performance of those LSTK contract is differentiated and there is a mix of oil or gas LSTK drilling contract and both were actually sustained and I've not been impacted at this point. And we don't expect to be the case. So that's - just to give you a little bit of more growth.\nDavid Anderson: That's great, thank you very much. So, my bigger-picture question is sort of going looking back in history here a bit. When we talk about the cycles, it seems to be in 1986 is kind of a clear parallel to kind of what we're going through now, not only in terms of magnitude, but kind of how we got here in lot of respects. Now you started Schlumberger in 1987 and just like now, Schlumberger was going through a pretty major management change at the time? But as that cycle slowly regained its footing, Schlumberger really accelerated of the downturn, set the company up for another decade of success. So my question is, as you look back at those days in the late 80s and early 90s, and I'm sure you've studied your predecessors during those times, I'm just wondering kind of what are some of the big lessons that you learned about how to position the company what to focus on? And really I guess, what were kind of the keys to success back then - that you're thinking about now as the cycle resets?\nOlivier Le Peuch: So first, I'm not old enough to comment on 1986 apparently. So no, Dave I think if we step back, I think the industry has a proportion to go into crisis and rebound. So, no doubt that this industry will engineer or innovate its way up to the current crisis, no doubt. I think the characteristics on the other side of this cycle will be different from what we have known in the last 10 to 15 years. And I think capital efficiency, capital discipline, efficiency cost of service delivery would be the prime element of differentiation. So, we\u2019re now talking about technology, we'll talk about technology that impacted performance across the lifecycle that impact efficiency hence, the fast adoption of digital will be differentiation. So, when you look back on cost okay, the success we had historically was clearly on expanding our international franchise and being the service company that could create value and find hydrocarbon reserve and help developed those reserves everywhere in the world in any condition. I think the game has changed this is not about finding new supply. It\u2019s produced this supply at a lower cost. I think on occasion, it would be short-cycle extraction of the next drop. On occasion, it will be finding the next advantage, offshore, deepwater, large basin. Hence technology will always make a difference, but it would be focused on performance impact efficiency, and this would change the game. The second aspect I think - and digital obviously is part of this, changing the cost of sales delivery, changing our efficiency factor. The second aspect is I believe, I truly believe that industry is recognizing. And we are having better engagement today than maybe we had in the past. Of course, the necessity to integrate and partner across the supply chain and supply chain across on the service side and from supply to operator, to align in partnership that will transcend and create the game change we need. Because we need to transform as an industry, we need to find a way to extract this capital efficiency by standardization, by changing the way we operate, by transforming the way we digitally align with our operators and across the service industry. So partnership across the supply chain to really step change capital efficiency across the lifecycle and the technology that have differentiated per basin, focused on performance and focused on lowering the cost of service delivery. This is what I think will be the winning factor in the future.\nDavid Anderson: I would also imagine that R&D spend is critical as well, right. I mean that's one of the things I've noticed over the decades?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Obviously.\nDavid Anderson: That R&D spend is critical?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Obviously, as I said, I think the industry will innovate its way. And innovation will come from the way we reinvent ourselves, including this partnership, this transformation, operational transformation. But obviously, there will be a very key element of technology. We will have to invent the next and continue to lead on our digital - and invent the technology that will transform operationally the performance of the asset of our customer, step change the efficiency of finding oil and automate the drilling operations. So that will come through technology investment. And no doubt that will continue and we\u2019ll invest into this to make it happen.\nOperator: And our next question is from Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nConnor Lynagh: I was wondering, if you could sort of frame something for me here. I think the pace of cost reductions and in many cases, structural cost reductions has surprised a lot of observers of the industry. And I guess what everyone is trying to figure out is how sustainable or how scalable these cost savings are. So, if you could characterize the $1.5 billion of cost savings. Are you thinking of your business as able to reach the same revenue levels as previously? Are you not interested in reaching the same revenue levels that you had in say 2018 or 2019, because some of it was so returns-dilutive? How do you think about the ability of the organization to respond to higher activity levels, if and when we get there?\nOlivier Le Peuch: No. First, Connor, I think, we had to realize - and I think this realization has been across the whole industry, that I think we are transitioning into a new normal. And the new normal means that the market for the foreseeable short term will be structurally smaller in size. So, I think we have to make that realization. Whether we call it 25%, 30%, 35% smaller in size, it depends on the region and the business, but I think that's a reality that is leading us. So, I think that was the first and foremost realization. The second one we have realized and hence the decision that we have made to restructure the company to adjust and align with this new reality and to right-size our structure, including our support fixed structure to account for this. This doesn't say that we are not ready for growth. We're absolutely ready for growth. But I think that we believe that the transformation we are going through, the capital efficiency, resource efficiency that we have enabled in the last three years to four years and the digital transformation we're going through in our operation todaywill create the leverage that we need to add future growth at much limited - much more limited resource and our capital needs in the future. So, I believe that the asset velocity, the capital efficiency we'll play out. Now this being said, we will be very strict on our capital stewardship program, and as such indeed made the right choice to not deploy capital and resource when we believe that the return are not in place. And I think we have started to do this. And we are successful in doing this, and we continue to do so. But at the end, we will grow. The recovery is on the horizon. When and as it recovers, we'll be ready with a different shape, a different structure, a new company, be it in the North America market, where we will changing to an asset-lite technology access model and scale-to-fit approach or internationally, where we are more focused on performance, and we are getting success out of this, and we'll accelerate our digital transformation. So yes, we will, and we believe that this structure will be giving us more flexibility as well as we'll have the core digital and transformation capability to flex with an upturn at a better incrementals.\nConnor Lynagh: I guess I would extend basically the same question to a point you were making, which is a lot of the things you're doing will make the business more capital-light. Is there a way that you can frame for people how the capital intensity or the CapEx needs as a percentage of sales, however you think of it, could look on a go forward basis relative to what we saw in the previous cycle here.\nStephane Biguet: I think we have been in 5% to 7% as a guidance that we have been consistent with. And I think that \u2013 we believe that we'll be able, as the market returns, to-- after completing some of the transformation for asset-light and technology access to continue on this 5% to 7%. We are comfortable on this. And that's the guidance we keep.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, we have one final question from the line of Marc Bianchi with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nMarc Bianchi: Olivier, you mentioned a soft landing for international in third quarter. I think there's a lot of questions from investors about budget resets and you know what we've seen so far internationally this year and if there's incremental risks to 2021. Are you comfortable saying that absent seasonality that we usually see in the first quarter that international has bottomed in the second quarter of 2020?\nOlivier Le Peuch: It's too early to say Marc, I think what I'm saying is that the - for this year, the effect of the budget adjustments and the COVID disruption that were budget the significant decline 22% rate decline in the second quarter. These two conditions especially receding and subdued as we go forward. We don't anticipate significant further budget cuts at the current pace. This however is truly to say whether the consequence on the budget setting in 2021 if the market was if the market was indicative of a slow, but steady recovery scenario that we\u2019ll according to many of the analysts, IEA, and others to indicate a exit rate at $50 or $60 in 2020 for the Brent. In 2021 obviously this will certainly support a steady 2021 compared to the H2 on right of activity internationally. But this is too early to say and I think we have to wait, the budget cycle and also obviously, three to four months of more economic recovery of pandemic containment to judge what 2021 demand-supply balance could be, and what the condition for the budget will be in 2021.\nMarc Bianchi: Okay, well, maybe following up on that thought about 2021. If I sort of take the run rate level of EBITDA that you have here it's about 3.3 billion and we've got another 900 million of cost savings that should be realized, you're kind of on a $4.2 billion annualized rate. As you look to 2021 understanding there's a lot of uncertainty, what would you say are the biggest factors that, you know, could be driving that higher or lower?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think obviously the pace of economic recovery, the anticipated demand and supply balance, and the repercussion it will have on the confidence of the operator to invest or reinvest, I think is the major factor that will shape the turn of 2021. So, again, if it is a run rate of H2 times two, we expect to sustain whatever we will produce in the second half, and multiply by two, that is the correct assumption. But again, the risk, I think, comes down to the demand supply more than anything else. North America is a little bit of a wild card and we don't expect this to be a significant year, but it will be up most likely as a slow but steady recovery, but will not come back to the heyday. So I think overall, I think you have the gallons, but the factor is predominantly the economic outlook and the demand-supply - the impact on demand-supply prediction. And we cannot comment more than this at this point.\nMarc Bianchi: Fair enough, thanks very much. I'll turn it back.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Marc. So I believe we are the - it's time to close. So to close let me let me leave you with three points. Firstly, our Q2 performance reflects the decisiveness and depth of our cost adjustments and cash preservation actions. I'm very pleased with the operational performance, international margins resilience, cash flow results, and the take in digital during the quarter. Secondly, we are resetting the company structure to support our performance vision and to align with the new market reality and as such, we have initiated a clear path to restore margins and returns performance with the backdrop of a structurally smaller market. We expect this to show visibly during the second half, absent of a setback in economic recovery. Finally, our performance strategy with digital and sustainability has imperatives, and capital stewardship and fit for basin technologies as performance factors will create differentiation in this new industry landscape, and we'll support our returns ambition, particularly as the future recovery pivots towards international market. So with this, and now, before I close the call, I wish everyone and I, wish everyone a safe and happy summer. I would like to thank Simon Farrant for nearly 33 years of service, as he has elected to take an early retirement from Schlumberger. Simon has been a very familiar voice and face throughout the last six years, 26 quarters, in his role as Vice President of Investor Relations. And I trust that his unique contributions to both Schlumberger and the investor community will be greatly missed. Simon, we wish you and your family all the best. Enjoy the new chapter!\nSimon Farrant: Thank you, Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: ND Maduemezia, who most recently was the Sub-Sahara Africa GeoMarket Manager, will take over from Simon effective at the end of this month. I ask that you all welcome ND and extend to him the same, high level of support and professional engagement as shared with Simon. Welcome, ND.\nND Maduemezia: Thank you, Olivier. I am excited and truly honored to take on this role, and I look forward to working very closely with all of you. I turn the call over to Simon.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Simon?\nSimon Farrant: Well, thank you very much, Olivier. It's been an honor to serve as the Head of Investor Relations, as you say for the last 26 quarters. And I wish my good friend, ND, all the best in taking over this role. Thank you, operator, you may close the call.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference service. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Stephane Biguet",
            "content": "Thank you, Olivier. Good morning ladies and gentlemen and thank you for participating in this conference call. Second quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits was $0.05. This represents a decrease of $0.20 sequentially and $0.30 when compared to the same quarter of last year. During the quarter, we recorded $3.7 billion of pretax charges. These charges primarily relate to workforce reductions, the impairment of an APS investment, and excess assets. You can find details of the components in the FAQs at the end of our earnings press release. Other than the $1 billion of severance, the rest of the charges are largely non-cash. The charge relating to severance covers both the permanent fixed-cost reductions we are implementing as part of the Company restructuring as well as the variable headcount reductions we are executing to adjust to the reduced level of activity. It is important to note that these impairments were all recorded as of the end of June. Therefore, our second quarter results did not include any benefit from reduced expenses as a result of these charges. However, going forward, the impact of the Q2 charges will result in reduced depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $80 million on a quarterly basis, while lease expense will be reduced by $25 million. Approximately $70 million of this quarterly pretax reduction will be reflected in the Production segment. The remaining $35 million will be reflected amongst the Characterization, Drilling, and Cameron segments. The quarterly after-tax impact of these reductions is approximately $0.07 in EPS terms. I will now summarize the main drivers of our second-quarter results. Overall, our second-quarter revenue of $5.4 billion decreased 28% sequentially. Pretax segment operating margins decreased 303 basis points to 7.4%. The swift actions we have taken to reduce variable costs combined with the early results of our restructuring and structural cost-reduction efforts resulted in decremental margins of less than 20% both sequentially and year-over-year. As a reminder, our restructuring program will permanently remove $1.5 billion of fixed costs, with more than half relating to our international businesses. For the sake of clarity, let me highlight that these are true cash savings. They do not take into account the reduction in depreciation and amortization expense as a result of impairment charges. We have achieved approximately 40% of this $1.5 billion target in the second quarter. And we aim to complete the large majority of the remainder before the end of the year. This will provide a strong tailwind to our margins in the second half of the year and into 2021. Now looking at our results by business segment, second-quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $1.1 billion decreased 20% sequentially, while margins increased 357 basis points to 7.6% (sic) [17.6%]. The revenue decrease was due to customers curtailing discretionary exploration-related expenditures. However, margins expanded as a result of the implementation of prompt cost reduction measures and the resilience of our digital businesses. The adoption of new Wireline technology also contributed to the margin increase. Drilling revenue of $1.7 billion decreased 24%, while margins fell by 289 basis points to 9.6%. These decreases were primarily driven by a sharp decline in the North America land rig count and COVID-related restrictions in Latin America, Africa, and Europe. Production revenue of $1.6 billion decreased 40% sequentially, and margins fell 630 basis points to 1.5%. These declines were largely a result of a sharp drop in pressure pumping activity in North America land. Additionally, a production interruption in Ecuador that was caused by a major landslide resulted in a revenue reduction this quarter of approximately $100 million in our Asset Performance Solutions or APS business. This had a significant albeit temporary impact on our decremental margins. Largely as a result of this production interruption, partially offset by the effects of the Q2 impairment, we anticipate APS amortization expense will increase by approximately $40 million next quarter. Finally, Cameron revenue of $1 billion decreased 19% while margins decreased by 180 basis points to 7.9% as international margin expansion partially offset the impact of the severe activity decline in North America land. Let me now turn to our liquidity. I was very pleased with our cash flow generation during the second quarter, given the environment we were operating in. We generated $803 million of cash flow from operations and $465 million of free cash flow. Both of these amounts are higher than last quarter, despite making $370 million of severance payments during the second quarter. As a result, we ended the quarter with total cash and investments of $3.6 billion. Our net debt at the end of the quarter was $13.8 billion, an increase of $479 million compared to last quarter, but down almost $1 billion when compared to the same time last year. During the quarter, we spent $251 million on CapEx and invested $61 million in APS projects. Our total capital spend for 2020, including APS and multi-client, will now be approximately $1.5 billion. This represents a 45% decrease as compared to 2019, mostly coming from lower CapEx in North America and reduced investments in APS projects. Our total APS investments for 2020 was revised down to about $300 million. Despite the second quarter being the most challenging quarter in our modern history, we were still able to take steps to further strengthen the balance sheet. We issued \u20ac1 billion of 1.375% notes due 2026, $900 million of 2.65% notes due 2030, and \u20ac1 billion of 2% notes due 2032. By issuing these notes at attractive rates, we were able to retire approximately $1.5 billion of bonds that were coming due in the next four quarters. It also allowed us to pay down existing commercial paper, providing us with additional flexibility. We ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of commercial paper borrowings outstanding. Therefore, after considering the $3.6 billion of cash on hand, as well as $6.2 billion of undrawn credit facilities, we had approximately $9.8 billion of liquidity available to us at the end of the quarter. This represents an increase of $3 billion from where we ended last quarter. In light of this available liquidity and the various actions we have taken during the quarter, our debt maturity profile over the next 24 months is quite manageable. We only have $500 million of bonds coming due in the fourth quarter of this year and another $665 million coming due in the third quarter of 2021. The next maturity after that will only come in August 2022. Before I conclude, let me say a quick word about our financial reporting going forward. The corporate reorganization we are undertaking is a significant exercise that will take some time to fully implement. Therefore, we will continue to report our results for the third quarter consistent with our historical practices. Starting with the fourth quarter, we will report our results on the basis of the four new divisions. We will continue to disclose revenue on a geographic basis quarterly in line with our historical format in other words, split between North America, Latin America, ECA, and the Middle East. Going forward, once a year and in connection with our fourth-quarter and full-year earnings release, we will disclose pretax operating income split between North America and the rest of the world. These margins will include the results of the Cameron businesses. Shortly after we issue our third-quarter earnings release, we will provide historical pro forma financial information based upon the new division structure as well as the annual geographic margins to assist you with your modeling. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier. Just to add, Olivier, maybe one additional factor on top of the incremental fixed cost savings is also that the full quarter effect of the large headcount reductions we executed in Q2. The exit rates of those headcount reduction was much larger than the average. So we'll have that tailwind as well. Sure, sure, good morning. Look for the second half, we actually expect our cash flow from operations to remain very strong, even if indeed, you're right, the working capital release will not be as large as it was in Q2, because activity - if we assume activity stabilizing, as we said, in the second half. However again, we've already shown all fixed-cost cash savings materializing in the rest of the year and the reduced intensity of our capital spend. We think we can still generate positive free cash flow in the second half, despite the additional severance payments that we will incur. And to your question, we think we will incur on most of the remaining severance payments in the second half of the year. Yes, you can put a little bit more because we had $200 million of provisions at the end of March as well. So, it is a full quarter impact, meaning that the Q2 results include the 40%, and we exited the quarter actually at a much higher rate. So this is why we have a nice tailwind starting into Q3 and going into Q4 with the remaining 60%. Most of it is - a lot of it is already realized at the end of- or triggered at the end of the quarter. Yes, it will be from the impairment effect. However, you will also see excuse me, you will also see a reversal coming from the Ecuador landslide incident that will partially offset this effect. But from impairment totally - yes, go ahead, Scott. It is not going to be so far from Q2, if you assume the same revenue levels we have. I think we have been in 5% to 7% as a guidance that we have been consistent with. And I think that \u2013 we believe that we'll be able, as the market returns, to-- after completing some of the transformation for asset-light and technology access to continue on this 5% to 7%. We are comfortable on this. And that's the guidance we keep."

            "content": "Thank you, Simon, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you all for joining us on the call. Today, in my prepared remarks, I would like first to review the company's performance during the second quarter, then offer commentary on the short-term outlook, and finally reflect on where we stand in our performance strategy vision. As we close one of the most difficult quarters in our industry, I want first to thank the women and men of Schlumberger for their resilience, performance, and dedication during these unique circumstances and express my pride not only in what we have achieved, but also in what we contributed for the health of the communities where we work and live. Reflecting on the quarter's performance, I would like to comment on four key attributes that clearly made this quarter unique in its achievements: operational performance, margins, cash and liquidity, and digital. First, our operational performance supported our best-ever safety and service quality performance on record. Indeed, our frequency of safety incidents reduced nearly 50% from a year ago, whilst our service quality improved nearly 40% year-on-year\u2014to reach a new benchmark in integrity performance for our customers. This is an attribute of our performance vision that is becoming a clear differentiator in execution, and very well acknowledged by our customers. Second is the strength of our operating margins\u2014with 18% decremental margins despite the most severe and abrupt activity drop. These margins resulted primarily from the combination of swift actions on variable costs and the decision to accelerate the restructure of the company. This new organizational structure of four divisions aligned with our customers' key workflow and five key basins of activity, is significantly leaner and more responsive, adapted to the new industry normal, and strategically aligned with our performance vision. Internationally, the impact of these decisive actions also combined with progress on our capital stewardship program and continued industry adoption of new technology, particularly reservoir evaluation and digital solutions. As a consequence, the margins of our international franchise remained remarkably resilient, flat sequentially, despite the material revenue contraction and the adverse margin impact from the major disruption in Ecuador. As outlined in the earnings release, the majority of our GeoMarkets and three out of four business segments either expanded or maintained margins internationally, clearly demonstrating the strength of our franchise and the resilience of our earnings power. In North America, we accelerated the restructuring initiated last year with emphasis on scale-to-fit and the asset-light business model with significant permanent reductions to fixed and infrastructure costs. At this point, we have shutdown about 150 of our facilities and continue to make progress on the technology access franchise. In short, we readied the business for a market of smaller scale and lower-growth outlook, but with higher returns. Third, the cash flow performance was extremely solid during the quarter, building on very strong cash flow from operations and leveraging the aggressive reduction of our capital spending. In fact, cash flow was still strong even when excluding working capital and accounting for the significant negative impact of severance payments during the quarter. Similarly, the liquidity position of the company significantly improved during Q2, while debt was visibly lower year-over-year. The attention to liquidity and cash preservation has been a very clear focus for the entire management team and finance function during the last several months, and I'm quite satisfied to have navigated this very difficult quarter with such a positive outcome. Finally, the adoption of digital, both internally and externally, is becoming a major - factor of performance and was very impactful during the second quarter operationally and financially. Internally, we made significant improvement in the deployment of digital operations particularly remote operations and digital inspections, as the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions created a catalyst for further adoption. Our drilling remote operations expanded over 25% during the quarter to exceed two-thirds of our drilling activity. We have drilled 1,250 wells in Q2 using our remote operations capability, supported by more than 250 remote operations engineers. In addition, we are now performing over 1,000 digital inspections per week, applied to maintenance, manufacturing, or integration applications across more than 40 countries, leveraging our digital backbone infrastructure. Therefore during the quarter, digital operations had a magnifying impact lowering the cost of service delivery, the size of operating crews, and increasing efficiency across operations lifecycle, hence contributing to our operating margins. Externally, we saw greater adoption of our open digital platform for both subsurface and operations solutions. The diversity and depth of digital solutions deployed with our customers, as described in several examples in our earnings release, reflects the growing maturity of the digital transformation in our industry and the success of our DELFI platform. We are extremely proud to be associated with ExxonMobil for the deployment of DrillPlan and DrillOps digital solutions to transform drilling planning and operations including automation. We share the same vision for the future of our industry, with ambition to deliver faster and lower-cost wells through digital technology. As digitalization is accelerating, we are also seeing continued progress in technology adoption despite the challenging context, as fit-for-basin and performance-focused technology generate significant efficiency gains for our customers. All in all, this quarter promised to be messy from an activity outlook, and it certainly was. However, the performance and resilience of our team, our decisive actions to preserve cash and margins, and the continued execution of our strategy, including digital, have delivered a very strong outcome, resetting the company's competitiveness, and enabling us to operate with resilient margins in a structurally smaller market. Now let me turn to the short-term outlook. Given the uncertainties regarding the pace of economic and oil demand recovery, the range of activity outcomes for the second half of the year is still wide. However, with what we know and see today, we expect the global activity decline to recede into a soft landing in the coming months, absent further negative impact from COVID-19 on economic recovery or escalating rig activity disruptions. In the North America market, there is an uptick of DUC completions activity in the U.S., contrasted by the slow, but continued decline on both land and offshore rig activity. The frac rebound is expected to last until the seasonal decline at year-end, provided commodity pricing remains stable. International activity outlook appears mixed due to seasonal effect across the different basins. However, it's still indicative of slight sequential contraction - for drilling activity during Q3, particularly for deepwater and exploration. With this combined North America and international activity outlook and based on our position in the respective markets, we anticipate revenue to remain essentially flat sequentially on a global basis, with a slight positive uptick internationally, offset by flat- to low-single-digit decline in North America. In this context, and absent of any new setback due to COVID-19, we expect EBITDA and operating income to grow and the respective margins to expand during Q3, above and beyond the positive impact of impairment charges. These margins will benefit from the combination of incremental restructuring cost savings during the second half of the year, tailwind from the recovery of activity in Ecuador, and continued execution of our capital stewardship strategy. While we continue to navigate the trough of this cycle, we are actually setting an inflection point in our margins' performance, ahead of the recovery and despite the backdrop of a significantly smaller market size. Cash flow performance in the coming quarter will continue to benefit from the tailwind of our aggressive capital spend adjustment, focus on working capital efficiency, and incremental cash savings from our restructuring program. Our ambition in the second half remains positive free cash flow despite anticipated severance payments. Put another way, in a flattening activity outlook for the next two or three quarters, our ambition is to execute on a path of visible margin recovery and robust free cash flow generation as we transition into 2021. We embarked on a new strategy less than one year ago, but market conditions created a catalyst to accelerate the restructuring of the company to align with our performance vision. The early results of this strategic execution are already visible in our operational performance, our financial results, and in the alignment with the new industry landscape. Our mid to long-term financial targets remain intact and clearly focused on returns. I believe that the steps accomplished during the quarter not only solidify our vision, but also created a clear path to restore margins and returns performance despite a structurally smaller market. And now I will hand the call to Stephane, who will discuss Q2 financials and the impact of our cost-out program in a bit more detail. Yes, thank you. Thank you, Stephane. So I think we are ready to take your questions. Well, thank you, James. So, I think as we commented before, I think, we are not ready to disclose the detail of our revenue and margin contribution, net contribution from the digital business. Suffice to say that I think it has been accretive from the growth. It has been - the segment of our business that has been declining the least in the last quarter. It has been the one that has seen the most expansion of margin as well during the quarter. So, I think it is material to our business. Our ambition remains the same. We want to double this business in the midterm, double its size. And I think we will use for that two avenue - three avenues, the avenues of subsurface digital platform, where we are doing this transition to cloud-based DELFI solution with our customers, and I think we are already seeing a lot of traction into that space. And I think this will give us new revenue stream of IT infrastructure cloud operation in addition to transformation services for every customer that we transition. Secondly, we want to open a new business around data, and be it on the analytics or be it on the subsurface or operational data that we start to offer our platform for data exchange or for trading those data. So, we have introduced GAIA as a platform, and I think we are seeing success through national data rooms, as you have seen in Egypt, and other place in the world. So, I think that's a second new revenue stream that we are developing. And finally, digital operation. I think you have seen recent announcement of the partnership we have with - we have developed with Exxon, and you are about to hear more in the future. We'll continue to lead in this drilling operation as well as production operation with Sensia, our partner, our JV. And I think these are the three revenue streams that we are developing compared to one we had before. So, this will give us the opportunity to expand in multiple facets and not only into the license for subsurface application. I think, no doubt, I think with this growth and accretive margin, it would be higher. I think using the benefits - the benefits from digital will also benefit our customer. That's the reason why we are seeing this adoption, because they realize that they extract efficiency, they transform their own operational workflow, and as such, reduce the total cost of the - in the life cycle of the operation. So, we will benefit, they will benefit. We believe, we have the edge. We are ahead of our competitors. And we own the platform that the industry is adopting. So that will give us sustainable differentiation. Yes, Sean. And I think you have to realize that the - compared to the last cycle, I think things have changed. And first and foremost, I think the margins have been reset for the whole industry. The pricing concession have been steep, and we have not recovered from this pricing from the last cycle. So I think first, there is not much that we can give and share. And I think the approach that we are taking with our customers, actually engage collaboratively across the full life cycle of their operation and eliminate waste and focus on engaging to reduce cost of service delivery jointly. And I think we are seeing success in this approach. We are being awarded an expanded scope when we succeed into eliminating costs and eliminating waste across the value chain. So, you will see more of this approach and less of a pricing because the industry doesn't have much to give. And I think our customer realize this. And I think we are working more collaboratively than we had in the last five years on this. And I believe that the margins expansion that we are realizing or the resilience of the margin we are realizing today will be something that we'll be able to keep and build upon as the recovery will start to happen. I think, the lesson learned from this, I think, is the industry has learned to be capital disciplined. And I think we have learned, all of us. And I think, we have suffered from some of the steps we took as an industry. And I think, the capital discipline that I have seen and that we are using today, I think is very prominent in many place. And I think we have been having a very strict capital stewardship program, where we make a clear choice on the, I would say, allocating capital where we see returns. And as such, we are grading the opportunity that comes our way. And I believe some of our competitors are applying the same approach as the return are not acceptable the way they were and the way they have been at the trough. So I think the capital discipline is something that has changed. And I think expect that the capital discipline will be an element of success in the future. Now this being said, very large tender, very large scope that have a runway for multi-years will be competitive. But I think we'll demonstrate we have the most competitive cost platform to operate those large contracts and we'll be able to retain margins in those conditions. Let me - Angie, let me offer some very qualitative comments, and I will let Stephane add if he believe that we need to add. So first, I don't think we are in a position where we would like to give quantitative guidance on these. I think considering the level of uncertainty in the mix that could, as we have seen in the second quarter, have changed dramatically partly internationally. I don't think I will go further on a quantitative guidance going forward. But I think we are seeing positive and negative. Obviously, on the positive side, we are seeing the fall through, the incremental impact of our restructuring costs that will continue to fall into a tailwind for our margins. We'll also see, obviously, the return of our Ecuador activity, as you have heard, $100 million impact on the top line. That will come back both EBITDA and margins -- and operating margins in the third quarter. And at the same time, I think the execution that we have seen happening on capital stewardship and success of technology, including digital will also be an uplift. Now, this would be partially offset and one of them will be the top line measure that we took, exceptional measure we took during the second quarter, will not be there again. But I think as a mix, you understand that this will lift our margin despite a top line flat. No, very good question I think the - first I think Reservoir Characterization is certainly the one that is the least \u2013having the least exposure to North America as a benefit - had a benefit on international. As I did mention, three out of the four business group had flat or expanding margin internationally and that was the case for Reservoir Characterization. Now to be specific, I would say that a little bit more than half, I will say, came from this aggressive action we take on the structure and cost reduction. But I think the other half came from a technology adoption. And technology adoption, Reservoir Evaluation from Wireline with Ora as the platform of service continue to be very, very successful in the campaign of the - even if we have less exploration activity, we are able to deploy this new technology with much success, and it was the highest quarter in terms of revenue for that new technology Ora. And digital, so I will say that, it's a technology success as much and technology adoption success as much as a cost structure. So, the other segment have technology - and I think and we'll continue to succeed as well. So, I'm not worried about our ability to grow margin in every business group. But obviously, we benefited more from the differentiation of our technology in Reservoir Characterization. Yes, I think the RCG the Reservoir Characterization Group, I think has multiple aspect to it. I think, one is the digital. And I think this one, independently of the trajectory of the recovery of the supply-demand balance will continue to benefit from the digital transformation that is happening in our industry. When it comes to the Wireline, the Testing, the reservoir evaluation aspect, I think you have to look at two aspects; one is first, exploration still is happening and will continue to happen. There were more than 100 wells explored during the offshore during the second quarter, and there will be more than 100 wells, exploration wells in the first quarter. And hence the ability we have, the differentiation and technology with platforms such as Ora will continue to be providing us support and sustain margin in this environment. Secondly, Reservoir Characterization also does characterization for producing reservoir, so that when there is a short-cycle upside of trying to extract more from existing reservoir without exploring. We are applying technology for intervention, we are applying technology for testing of the reservoir, so that we can optimize. And I think we have seen actually more resilience of that Wireline intervention production services during the quarter than on the evaluation services during the last quarter. So, I'm reading this, I'm optimistic and quite reassured that the portfolio we have is well balanced and include for Reservoir Characterization production-related technology that will make a difference as our customer will go back into extracting more from the reservoir and the producing field they have. Yes, thank you. So, I think the Middle East activity is seeing indeed a unique mix. The reason for this is that as part of the OPEC plus commitment and the compliance. There were decisions made during the second quarter for several of the national company, operating in Middle East to contain the activity and to reduce activity including rig activity or rigless activity during the third quarter. So, this is impacting several country and in particular, Saudi. So, the number of rigs that the study was operating at beginning of the year compared to where it is operating now, they will be more than 40 rigs down from January to June, and another nine or 12 rig possibly will go down in the third quarter. So, no doubt that there is a decline by the effect of the transition exit rate from Q2, as well as some further contraction of activity in the third quarter. That's true for that country. So depending on the exposure you have in Middle East, it can be significant or it can be offset. In our case, we are offsetting this by gain of activity or share in specifically Qatar and Kuwait. And as such, the overall outlook for us on Middle East is relatively flat on a sequential basis where, indeed, the underlying rig activity sequentially will go down 6% to 7% across the region. But depending on the - so yes, the activity is going down sequentially, no doubt. And it will not be corrected because of the decision of last week OPEC plus agreement to reinstall-- restore the 1.9 million-barrel cut. This was already factored when those activity cuts were decided. And hence, I'm not expecting any impact on this. So, yes, mix down. However, depending on the market exposure we, in our case, are able to hold our top line relatively flat in that context. Good question. I think the first we do confirm that our ambition is to indeed on a flat outlook, absent of a significant setback that would come from a reversal of the pandemic situation. But, and considering the forward looking, there will be some seasonal effect. So, it's very early to give a perspective on the top line evolution from third quarter to fourth quarter. But assuming that the current directional soft lending of activity continues well into the fourth quarter we will expect indeed this benefit to carry through and this margin expansion to be consistent and to still hold both from EBITDA and from the operating margin in the fourth quarter. So that's correct, and I think that - we are supporting this. I don't think we are in a position where we can project, and we want to detail and give guidance on the business segment outlook beyond next quarter. We expect them to indeed solidify and expand margin next quarter. But I think to go beyond that there will be some end-of-year effect that could twist some of the fall through. But overall, on a global basis, at the company level, this is what we're expecting. So, the first measure during the third quarter - the second quarter have been obviously on oil. However, there have been some side affect on gas because of budget reduction so budget constraints have led to a reduction of activity in gas as well. But what, to be specific, I'm sorry The gas LSTK contract indeed have reduced significantly. I'm not talking about the unconventional, but the conventional gas operation frac coil tubing rigless operation. And this has reduced to a new floor and this will possibly rebound. But yes, gas was affected for us the drilling LSTK by contract was unaffected. Probably because the performance of those LSTK contract is differentiated and there is a mix of oil or gas LSTK drilling contract and both were actually sustained and I've not been impacted at this point. And we don't expect to be the case. So that's - just to give you a little bit of more growth. So first, I'm not old enough to comment on 1986 apparently. So no, Dave I think if we step back, I think the industry has a proportion to go into crisis and rebound. So, no doubt that this industry will engineer or innovate its way up to the current crisis, no doubt. I think the characteristics on the other side of this cycle will be different from what we have known in the last 10 to 15 years. And I think capital efficiency, capital discipline, efficiency cost of service delivery would be the prime element of differentiation. So, we're now talking about technology, we'll talk about technology that impacted performance across the lifecycle that impact efficiency hence, the fast adoption of digital will be differentiation. So, when you look back on cost okay, the success we had historically was clearly on expanding our international franchise and being the service company that could create value and find hydrocarbon reserve and help developed those reserves everywhere in the world in any condition. I think the game has changed this is not about finding new supply. It's produced this supply at a lower cost. I think on occasion, it would be short-cycle extraction of the next drop. On occasion, it will be finding the next advantage, offshore, deepwater, large basin. Hence technology will always make a difference, but it would be focused on performance impact efficiency, and this would change the game. The second aspect I think - and digital obviously is part of this, changing the cost of sales delivery, changing our efficiency factor. The second aspect is I believe, I truly believe that industry is recognizing. And we are having better engagement today than maybe we had in the past. Of course, the necessity to integrate and partner across the supply chain and supply chain across on the service side and from supply to operator, to align in partnership that will transcend and create the game change we need. Because we need to transform as an industry, we need to find a way to extract this capital efficiency by standardization, by changing the way we operate, by transforming the way we digitally align with our operators and across the service industry. So partnership across the supply chain to really step change capital efficiency across the lifecycle and the technology that have differentiated per basin, focused on performance and focused on lowering the cost of service delivery. This is what I think will be the winning factor in the future. Obviously. Obviously, as I said, I think the industry will innovate its way. And innovation will come from the way we reinvent ourselves, including this partnership, this transformation, operational transformation. But obviously, there will be a very key element of technology. We will have to invent the next and continue to lead on our digital - and invent the technology that will transform operationally the performance of the asset of our customer, step change the efficiency of finding oil and automate the drilling operations. So that will come through technology investment. And no doubt that will continue and we'll invest into this to make it happen. No. First, Connor, I think, we had to realize - and I think this realization has been across the whole industry, that I think we are transitioning into a new normal. And the new normal means that the market for the foreseeable short term will be structurally smaller in size. So, I think we have to make that realization. Whether we call it 25%, 30%, 35% smaller in size, it depends on the region and the business, but I think that's a reality that is leading us. So, I think that was the first and foremost realization. The second one we have realized and hence the decision that we have made to restructure the company to adjust and align with this new reality and to right-size our structure, including our support fixed structure to account for this. This doesn't say that we are not ready for growth. We're absolutely ready for growth. But I think that we believe that the transformation we are going through, the capital efficiency, resource efficiency that we have enabled in the last three years to four years and the digital transformation we're going through in our operation todaywill create the leverage that we need to add future growth at much limited - much more limited resource and our capital needs in the future. So, I believe that the asset velocity, the capital efficiency we'll play out. Now this being said, we will be very strict on our capital stewardship program, and as such indeed made the right choice to not deploy capital and resource when we believe that the return are not in place. And I think we have started to do this. And we are successful in doing this, and we continue to do so. But at the end, we will grow. The recovery is on the horizon. When and as it recovers, we'll be ready with a different shape, a different structure, a new company, be it in the North America market, where we will changing to an asset-lite technology access model and scale-to-fit approach or internationally, where we are more focused on performance, and we are getting success out of this, and we'll accelerate our digital transformation. So yes, we will, and we believe that this structure will be giving us more flexibility as well as we'll have the core digital and transformation capability to flex with an upturn at a better incrementals. It's too early to say Marc, I think what I'm saying is that the - for this year, the effect of the budget adjustments and the COVID disruption that were budget the significant decline 22% rate decline in the second quarter. These two conditions especially receding and subdued as we go forward. We don't anticipate significant further budget cuts at the current pace. This however is truly to say whether the consequence on the budget setting in 2021 if the market was if the market was indicative of a slow, but steady recovery scenario that we'll according to many of the analysts, IEA, and others to indicate a exit rate at $50 or $60 in 2020 for the Brent. In 2021 obviously this will certainly support a steady 2021 compared to the H2 on right of activity internationally. But this is too early to say and I think we have to wait, the budget cycle and also obviously, three to four months of more economic recovery of pandemic containment to judge what 2021 demand-supply balance could be, and what the condition for the budget will be in 2021. I think obviously the pace of economic recovery, the anticipated demand and supply balance, and the repercussion it will have on the confidence of the operator to invest or reinvest, I think is the major factor that will shape the turn of 2021. So, again, if it is a run rate of H2 times two, we expect to sustain whatever we will produce in the second half, and multiply by two, that is the correct assumption. But again, the risk, I think, comes down to the demand supply more than anything else. North America is a little bit of a wild card and we don't expect this to be a significant year, but it will be up most likely as a slow but steady recovery, but will not come back to the heyday. So I think overall, I think you have the gallons, but the factor is predominantly the economic outlook and the demand-supply - the impact on demand-supply prediction. And we cannot comment more than this at this point. Thank you, Marc. So I believe we are the - it's time to close. So to close let me let me leave you with three points. Firstly, our Q2 performance reflects the decisiveness and depth of our cost adjustments and cash preservation actions. I'm very pleased with the operational performance, international margins resilience, cash flow results, and the take in digital during the quarter. Secondly, we are resetting the company structure to support our performance vision and to align with the new market reality and as such, we have initiated a clear path to restore margins and returns performance with the backdrop of a structurally smaller market. We expect this to show visibly during the second half, absent of a setback in economic recovery. Finally, our performance strategy with digital and sustainability has imperatives, and capital stewardship and fit for basin technologies as performance factors will create differentiation in this new industry landscape, and we'll support our returns ambition, particularly as the future recovery pivots towards international market. So with this, and now, before I close the call, I wish everyone and I, wish everyone a safe and happy summer. I would like to thank Simon Farrant for nearly 33 years of service, as he has elected to take an early retirement from Schlumberger. Simon has been a very familiar voice and face throughout the last six years, 26 quarters, in his role as Vice President of Investor Relations. And I trust that his unique contributions to both Schlumberger and the investor community will be greatly missed. Simon, we wish you and your family all the best. Enjoy the new chapter! ND Maduemezia, who most recently was the Sub-Sahara Africa GeoMarket Manager, will take over from Simon effective at the end of this month. I ask that you all welcome ND and extend to him the same, high level of support and professional engagement as shared with Simon. Welcome, ND. Simon?"

Later, there will be an opportunity for your questions and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Simon Farrant, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nSimon Farrant: Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited 2020 [First-Quarter] earnings call. Today's call is being hosted from Houston following the Schlumberger Limited Board meeting held earlier this week. Joining us on the call are Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Executive Officer; and Stephane Biguet, Chief Financial Officer. For today's agenda, Olivier will start with -- the call with his perspectives on the quarter and our updated view of the industry macro. After which, Stephane will give more details on our financial results. Then we will open up to questions. As always, before we begin, I would like to remind the participants that some of the statements we'll be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and our other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our first quarter press release, which is on our website. Now, I'll turn the call over to Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Simon, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I hope everyone is safe and well. This morning I'm going to comment on three topics: our Q1 performance; how we are managing in today\u2019s increasingly difficult operating environment; and how we see the outlook for the second quarter.  Before I do that, I would first like to thank the Schlumberger people around the world who are demonstrating great resilience and adaptability. I\u2019m very proud of our team and of what they have achieved in the first quarter. Despite the complications from COVID-19 outbreak, they delivered strong organizational performance throughout the quarter. We kept very close to our customer as the crisis developed and we were able to maintain well site operations with only minimal disruption across a few countries. The feedback I\u2019ve received from our customers has been both positive and appreciative of our operational performance. Despite the difficulty of the situation and the duress under which our people have been working, Q1 was one of the best quarter in terms of service quality and actually the best quarter ever in safety performance. Let\u2019s start with the perspective on our first quarter results. The resilience of our performance given the COVID-19 related disruption and the early impact of the oil price collapse, delivered earnings of $0.25 per share; only marginally short of our original expectation. The quarter was characterized by the usual combination of seasonal impact in the Northern Hemisphere and the sequential decline of product and software sales. However, toward the end of the quarter, activity started to decline in several basins due to the unprecedented drop in oil price and the increasing challenges posed by COVID-19. The most severe impact was in North America land where customers were fast to react with a sharp 17% cut in rig count. In our business segments, Reservoir Characterization revenue closed the quarter sequentially down 20%, partly on seasonal effects but also as a consequence of customers curtailing their discretionary and exploration spending in the latter part of the quarter. The margins declined on the absence of significant multi-client software license sales, weak exploration mix and lower contribution from discretionary software sales. Drilling revenue declined sequentially on seasonal effects and the collapse in North America late in the quarter, but displayed resilience with margins flat sequentially on our operational execution and our focus on underperforming business units as well as continued success in our technology access strategy. Production revenue declined on lower activity in international markets and weaker Asset Performance Solutions (APS) results. While Production margin declined 100 basis points driven by the weaker international activity, the success of our OneStim\u00ae scale-to-fit strategy in North America matched resource to market needs and optimize our operational footprint. Cameron revenue was seasonally lower and suffered from the exposure of the short-cycle business to North America. International Cameron revenue was also lower as we halted manufacturing in Italy and Malaysia in response to local restrictions to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Despite these negative effects, Cameron margin increased sequentially, driven largely by this quarter\u2019s favorable mix in the OneSubsea\u00ae portfolio.  Looking at North America land in more detail, the timely acceleration of our NAL strategy protected margins from excessive sequential decline. We began the quarter having scaled our OneStim fleet to fit the market, which resulted in higher utilization and minimal frac calendar gaps. However, as oil price began to collapse in March, customers rapidly dropped rigs and frac crews. Along with well construction and completion activity decreasing, the technology mix switched from driving performance to saving costs. We reacted rapidly by stacking frac fleets to protect our margins and had reduced capacity by more than 27% and reduced our CapEx plan by 60% by the end of the quarter. In contrast, our international revenue close to 2% ahead year-on-year or 4% when accounting for the 2019 business divestitures. Growth was resilient in key Schlumberger markets across Russia & Central Asia, Saudi Arabia & Bahrain, Far East Asia & Australia, Northern Middle East, Latin America North, and Norway & Denmark. Our first quarter cash flow from operations more than doubled year-on-year to $784 million as a result of our heightened focus on collections and our resilience in key international markets. Let me now talk about what we are doing to protect the company and how we have focused on cash, liquidity and the strength of our balance sheet in a period of high uncertainty as the depth and extent of the coronavirus impact on global oil demand remains unknown. First, and after an in-depth review of the possible outcomes of the new oil order we are facing, we have made the very difficult but necessary decision to reduce our dividend by 75%. This will protect our cash and liquidity in the current environment, while giving us greater flexibility going forward. We will continue to exercise stringent capital stewardship, while retaining the ability to balance any capital return to shareholders as operational conditions evolve. Second, we have reduced our capital investment program by more than 30% across CapEx, APS and multi-client. We\u2019re also reducing our research and engineering investment by more than 20% in the second quarter to reflect the necessary adjustment to our 2020 commercialization program. Further, we have accelerated and increased our structural cost reduction in North America in alignment with the scale-to-fit strategy initiated during the fourth quarter adjusted for the new environment. As a result, we unfortunately had to reduce our workforce in North America by close to 1,500 people during the first quarter.  We will continue to decisively implement structural change during the second quarter both in North America and internationally to align our cost base with the anticipated short-term and second half activity outlook with full understanding that the pace and scale of decline is still uncertain, but will be more abrupt than during any recent downturn. Finally, we have also taken exceptional temporary measures to conserve cash by implementing furloughs across many parts of organization, both in North America and internationally, and by reducing compensation for the executive team and for the Board of Directors. The result of these actions represents a significant step towards protecting the company cash and liquidity in the face of the significant uncertainties. I believe that our response so far has been swift and effective as demonstrated by our margin and cash flow performance during the first quarter, while providing service to all of our customers with unique resilience and performance across all basins.  Stephane will discuss the strength of our balance sheet, our access to liquidity and our capital investment program in more detail in a few minutes. Before that, let me give you our perspective for the second quarter. Despite the recent agreement by the world\u2019s largest oil producers to cut production, Q2 is likely to be the most uncertain and disruptive quarter that the industry has ever seen. We are therefore not in a position to provide guidance for the next quarter as we face two degrees of uncertainty beyond the severe impact of oil demand contraction and the level of commodity oil price. First, it is very difficult to model or predict the frequency or magnitude of the COVID-19 disruption on field operations. Second, it is too early to judge the impact of the recent OPEC+ decision on the level of international activity, as well as its repercussion on storage level globally and the related risks of production shut-ins. Let me however share our view on the key activity trends, starting with North America. We anticipate both rig activity and frac completion activity to continue to decline sharply during the second quarter to reach a sequential decline of 40% to 60%, which matches the full year budget adjustment guidance shared by most operators in North America land. This would represent the most severe decline in drilling and completion activity in a single quarter in several decades.  Internationally, we see a less severe sequential decline as some long-cycle offshore and land development markets should remain relatively resilient and will partially offset the exploration activity drop, as well as the expected activity adjustments that would result from the OPEC+ decision. Directionally, at this time, and excluding the seasonal rebound of rig activity in Russia and China, the international rig count is expected to decline by low to mid-teens sequentially. However, this will vary greatly by basin and per customer. We have been successful during the first quarter in providing the market with resilience and performance. We anticipate building on this success, and will fully leverage our unique international franchise to retain optimum activity mix going forward. As the quarter develops and we get more clarity on the timing and shape of demand recovery and better understand the OPEC+ deal\u2019s implementation and compliance, we will be able to discuss our outlook for the second half of the year with you. Let me conclude by reinforcing the enormity of the task ahead. It will require levels of response and depths of resilience that are yet to be fully realized. The actions we have taken so far have been focused on those things we can control in protecting our business with a clear priority on cash and liquidity in an uncertain industry and global environment. We\u2019ll continue to take the steps necessary to protect the safety and health of our people and pursue our ambition to be the performance partner of choice for our customers.  The future of our industry poses difficult challenges for people and for the environment, but continues to offer a unique opportunity. I believe that the resilience and performance of our people, our technology leadership and our financial strength will clearly position us for success as the industry rebounds from this unprecedented downturn. On to you, Stephane.\nStephane Biguet : Thank you, Olivier. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for participating in this conference call. First quarter earnings per share excluding charges and credits was $0.25. This represents a decrease of $0.14 sequentially and $0.05 when compared to the same quarter of last year. During the quarter, we recorded $8.5 billion of pre-tax charges driven by current market conditions and valuations. These charges primarily relate to goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets. As such, this charge is almost entirely non-cash. You can find details of its components in the FAQs at the end of our earnings press release. These impairments were all recorded as of the end of March. Therefore, the first quarter results did not include any benefit from reduced depreciation and amortization expense as a result of these charges. However, going forward, depreciation and amortization expense will be reduced by approximately $95 million on a quarterly basis. However, going forward, depreciation and amortization expense will be reduced by approximately $95 million on a quarterly basis. Approximately $45 million of this will be reflected in the Production segment. The remaining $50 million will be reflected in the \u2018Corporate and other\u2019 line item. The quarterly after-tax impact of these reductions is approximately $0.06 in EPS terms. I will now summarize the main drivers of our first quarter results. I will not go into much detail as Olivier already provided some key highlights, but I will spend more time updating you on our liquidity position. Overall, our first quarter revenue of $7.5 billion decreased 9% sequentially. Pre-tax segment operating margins decreased 181 basis points to 10.4%. First quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $1.3 billion decreased 20% sequentially, while margins decreased 839 basis points to 14%. The sequential drop was a combination of seasonal effects and early signs of customer curtailing discretionary expenditures. Drilling revenue of $2.3 billion decreased 6%, while margins were flat at 12.4%. Approximately half of that revenue decline was due to the divestiture of our Fishing & Remedial Tools business at the end of the fourth quarter. Production revenue of $2.7 billion decreased 6% sequentially, and margins declined 98 basis points to 7.8%. Cameron revenue of $1.3 billion decreased 10%, while margins slightly increased by 57 basis points to 9.7%. Our effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits was 17% in the first quarter as compared to 16% in the previous quarter. Please note that it is going to be challenging to provide guidance around our effective tax rate going forward as discussed in further detail in the FAQ at the end of our earnings release.  Let me now turn to our liquidity. During the first quarter, we generated $784 million of cash flow from operations. As Olivier mentioned, this is more than double what we generated during the same quarter last year. We spent $407 million on CapEx and invested $163 million in Asset Performance Solutions or APS projects.  We completed the sale of our interest in the Bandurria Sur Block in Argentina during the quarter. The net proceeds from this transaction combined with the proceeds we received from the divestiture of a smaller APS project, amounted to about $300 million. Looking forward, after considering the Argentina divestiture and reduction in the rest of our project portfolio, our APS investments for the full year will not exceed $500 million. With this, as well as the significant reduction of our operating CapEx engaged during the quarter, our total capital spend for 2020 including APS and multi-client will now be approximately $1.8 billion. This represents close to a 35% decrease as compared to 2019.  On the balance sheet side, we took a series of steps during the first quarter to reinforce our liquidity position. First, we ended the quarter with total cash and investments of $3.3 billion. While this cash balance is higher than what we generally like to carry, this was a conscious decision and I am very comfortable with it considering the current situation. Our net debt increased by only $171 million during the quarter, closing at $13.3 billion, which is more than $1 billion lower than the level we were at a year ago. During the first quarter, we issued EUR400 million of notes due in 2027 and another EUR400 million of notes due in 2031. These notes carry a weighted average interest rate of 2% after being swapped into U.S. dollars. We also renewed during the quarter our revolving credit facilities. These committed facilities amount to a total of $6.25 billion and do not mature until between February 2023 and February 2025. We ended the quarter with $2.7 billion of commercial paper borrowings outstanding. Therefore, after considering the $3.3 billion of cash on hand, we had $6.8 billion of liquidity available to us at the end of the quarter. In addition, we entered last week into another committed revolving credit facility for EUR1.2 billion. This is a one year facility that can be extended at our option for up to another year. We can also upsize the facility for syndication. To-date, we have not drawn on this facility. Finally, our short-term credit ratings, which are critical to maintain our privileged access to the commercial paper markets, were just recently reaffirmed by both Standard & Poor\u2019s and Moody\u2019s. In light of our available liquidity and the various actions undertaken during the quarter, our debt maturity profile over the next 12 months is quite manageable. We only have $500 million of bonds coming due in the fourth quarter of this year and another $600 million coming due in the first quarter of 2021. Our preference is to refinance these obligations with new bonds, markets permitting.  To close, let me come back to what is probably the most important decision of the quarter as it relates to capital allocation. In this environment, our strategic priority is obviously on conserving cash and further protecting our balance sheet. To this end, we have taken the prudent decision to reduce our quarterly dividend by 75%. The revised dividend still supports our shareholder value proposition by maintaining both a healthy yield and a reasonable payout ratio as we navigate these uncertain times. It also allows for prudent organic investment, while maintaining the self-discipline required under the capital stewardship program that we have committed to.  Finally, it gives us flexibility to adjust our capital return policy in the future whether through increased dividends or stock buybacks when operating and business conditions improve.  I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch : Thank you, Stephane. Thank you for this clarification. So ladies and gentlemen, I think we will open the floor for Q&A at this point.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question is from James West with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nJames West: Good morning, Olivier and Stephane. So Olivier, in terms of capital allocation strategy going forward, I know we had the dividend cut today, which is clearly a prudent move in light of the current environment, although we're going to stabilize and figure out how this market unfolds here in the next quarter or so. So how do you think about capital allocation through this downturn? Previously you guys were counter-cyclical, and getting into the SPM, you've obviously disbanded that, so I doubt that\u2019s an area of capital. But how are you thinking about the allocation of capital?\nOlivier Le Peuch: So, James, as you know, we have -- as part of the strategy, reaffirmed our capital stewardship program and that\u2019s a strategic step -- and I think under that umbrella we did reaffirm our priority for our capital allocation. And our cash from -- free cash flow from operation typically will be directed towards three buckets. The first one, to maintain and support our ongoing operation and that\u2019s part of what we do in the essential of under strict capital allocation for the CapEx. The second one, being obviously to maintain the strength of our balance sheet and to address the debt level that we need to maintain the right ratio. And finally, the dividend. Any excess cash beyond that, I think will be directed towards either business opportunity that represent an accretive return to our capital under the new program of capital stewardship or return distribution to the shareholder in the form of buyback or in the form of future increase of our dividend. That's the way we will continue to use the framework under these conditions. Stephane, do you want to add anything?\nStephane Biguet: You\u2019ve covered all. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Sean Meakim with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nSean Meakim: So maybe just to follow on to that. So good to hear the updated thoughts around capital allocation. Can we then maybe just dovetail into thinking about sources and uses of cash? The balance sheet has a pretty front-loaded maturity cadence over the next couple of years. So the $4 billion that you'll keep on the balance sheet from the reduction in dividend, that certainly will help you close the Bandurria Sur \u2026?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Operator, we lost Sean.\nOperator: Yes. One moment please. I apologize, Mr. Meakim, please go back ahead. Please go ahead with your question, I apologize.\nSean Meakim: So the main question is about sources and uses of cash. The balance sheet maturity cadence is pretty front load through 2023. And so it would be great to hear about how you think about sources and uses over the next couple of years to address that part of the balance sheet? Thank you. \nStephane Biguet: For the upcoming maturities, at least in the next 12 months, as I said, we are pretty well spaced and the amounts are quite reasonable. So really what we will do is, our objective is to refinance the maturities with new bonds or if cash permits we will pay down some of that debt to maintain the credit rating that we are targeting. And what we are targeting is really to ensure that we keep a strong investment grade credit in this cyclical environment. So, this will really be the way we will deal with the upcoming maturities, if that answer your question.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Sean, we have been -- on a continuous basis, we have been using bonds to refinance the maturities that are upcoming. I think we need -- as you heard Stephane today, we have two new bond that were issued during the first quarter in euro that were swapped back to dollar. And I think we had done that all along as part of our program and this was reviewed during the finance committee and there was an envelope agreed and approved by the board going forward to refinance a large amount and go after the bond market to address those. And we are confident with the current investment grade we have that we\u2019ll be successful in tapping in those markets. \nOperator: And our next question is from Angie Sedita with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAngie Sedita: So for Olivier or Stephane, maybe you could talk a little bit further about the cost cutting and even give us some parameters potentially around the dollar size of the cost cutting and the degree that it is fixed versus variable, if certain segments are impacted more so than others? And beyond Q2, if we look into Q3 and Q4, thoughts around decremental margins?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Angie, good morning. So first I think I\u2019ll stay quite generic in the statement I would make on purpose, because I think there is a lot of uncertainty into the level of outlook activity wise in the second half of the year. We are starting to understand where the quarter will land this quarter in North America and we are taking actions to address and right-size organization and I talked about 40% to 60%. So, you can understand that the organization will be adjusted towards that end. And I think it will affect more or less across all product lines. OneStim will be certainly rightsized on the high end of that framework. And we certainly have to execute faster the strategy of right-sizing or scale-to-fit as we call it, and when talking about the structure costs and the fixed structure costs, that's where we'll put some effort to make sure that the restructure and the fit-for-basin and the hub concentration we are putting for OneStim in the next few months will be addressed first and foremost in parallel with the variable cost action that we're taking.  So North America is fairly clear because activity\u2019s direction and drop of activity is already well understood. Internationally, I think it varies a lot from one geography to the next. And there is still a lot of uncertainty, partly with regard to the decision by the national company to cut -- the extent to which they will cut or not. So we are more prudent in our approach internationally, but we are as well executing there and doing both the structure -- fixed structure and as well as variable in the coming weeks. So to give you a number, I don't think there's a number we can quote. The number will keep evolving, but it will be likely to be in excess of $1 billion to just talk about compensation going forward on an annual basis. And this number will certainly change as we go forward.  So all-in-all, we continue to follow the curve, as we call it, albeit this year it's steeper and evolving faster. And we're addressing both the fixed and the variable as we have done in previous downturns. \nOperator: Our next question is from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nScott Gruber: I want to touch on working capital. Given your end market forecast, how should we think about working capital? Is there any way to dimension the potential benefit to cash this year or potential range of where days outstanding to land at the end of the year? And in any lessons learned from the last cycle that can help the working capital this cycle?\nStephane Biguet: Yes, Scott. We indeed expect to see our working capital winding down over the next few quarters as activity reduces. Now the magnitude of that working capital really is dependent on several factors of course, and probably the most significant -- you're asking about lessons learned here -- is the pace of cash collections we receive from our customers. So immediately as we saw the environment deteriorating, we refocused our entire organization on cash collections and you\u2019ve seen the early signs of this through our cash flow performance in Q1. So now, as much as we are working to prevent it, we could see payments being delayed over the next few quarters. But we will keep a very close eye on this.  Now, we may see some offsets to the positive working capital effects from restructuring cash costs as we continue to adjust our structure. But definitely we will see from a normal working capital trend, we will see a release. \nOperator: And next we have a question from Bill Herbert with Simmons. Please go ahead.\nBill Herbert: Two questions related to operating cash flow. First, I'll hit the working capital one again. Typically, the downturn, your international customers are slow pay if not everybody. And if you looked at 2015, there was a consumer of cash of $500 million or close to it. Will it be a source of cash or consumer cash? And then secondly your guidance with regard to depreciation. I think I heard you say down $95 million from what Q1 or Q4? Thank you.\nStephane Biguet: Yes. So on the working capital, you're right. The first year of the previous downturn we did have a consumption from the receivables. And again, we'll try to prevent this. We know the hotspots. And we keep a close eye on it, but it\u2019s -- there are some places where payments can be delayed for sure.  On the D&A, yes, I did say $95 million. It\u2019s pre-tax, obviously, and it's compared to the first quarter of this year. So $95 million, lower D&A going forward from Q1 2020 reference.\nOperator: Next we\u2019re going to have question from Kurt Hallead with RBC. Please go ahead.\nKurt Hallead: I wanted to -- thank you for all the color so far in a difficult environment. I want to follow-up on a couple of specifics. First on Reservoir Characterization, you had pretty substantial decline in margins in the first quarter here. And wanted to get a sense as to what may have been driving that and to whether or not that is now a new sustained kind of margin dynamic in Reservoir Characterization?\nOlivier Le Peuch: So Kurt, I think the reason why we have such a margin decline is due to two factors. The first is the fact that we had a severe top-line decline of 20% sequentially. That's unusual but it was on the low side of what we -- on the high side, what we typically see seasonally. And I think there are decrementals associated with this.  Secondly, there were a few disruptions during the quarter that added to the cost that could not be recovered during the quarter. And third and maybe the most important one I think is that the decision by the operator to start to tighten purse in the later part of the quarter did impact, what is typically making the quarter -- in the first quarter which is the sales of multi-client license, license sale and also the discretionary software.  So the Q1 is typically a low quarter for margin in Reservoir Characterization, seasonal effect. But this was compounded by the severity of the curtailment of spend in the latter part in the last six weeks of the quarter that\u2019s impacted what typically contributes positively to our Q1 quarter or any quarter which is the end of the quarter sales for software or for multi-client. So, we expect this to continue indeed, however, we expect the seasonal effect to recover somewhat, albeit the exploration budget will be lower by about 40% from last year, that's the estimate from our engagement with the customer.\nKurt Hallead: And then my follow up question would we then be on Cameron? And in that context, margins there were fairly strong. I think we can all expect that orders and FIDs and everything will wind up being pushed to the right. So I guess my question would be more along the lines of the projects that are in backlog. How should we think about the margin progression in Cameron as the rest of the year evolves?\nOlivier Le Peuch: There was -- there are two factors that did influence, one positive and one negative in the quarter and one of them will continue. So the negative factor impacted the Cameron margin related to the short-cycle impacting North America declining more than we had anticipated and this decline will continue. We are taking action to maintain or to control the decremental on that aspect. And the second factor was favorable mix in the OneSubsea long-cycle business. So the mix of these will continue going forward. We expect this to be slightly declining in the second quarter, because we see more decline in North America as was clearly highlighted in this call. And the favorable mix of OneSubsea will not repeat in the same magnitude for the next quarter. However, we still feel that the long-term backlog we have in OneSubsea and to some extent in the new award we got in long-lead drilling will support sustaining the margin somehow in the long-term.\nOperator: And next we\u2019ll go to a question from David Anderson with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nDavid Anderson: Good morning, Olivier. Two questions on the international front there. You highlighted spending being down 15% this year. It's obviously really complicated though, so many moving parts in there. And you don't have a ton of customer visibility, which I totally appreciate. But I was just wondering if you could just kind of talk about the different buckets that you're seeing out there. You've got offshore versus Middle East versus Latin America, everything is kind of moving at different rates. Could you just kind of give us thoughts generally on how you see all the different moving -- all the different parts moving? And then secondarily, if you could just kind of dig in on kind of Middle East, Russia and China, help us kind of collectively, how big is that part of your business? I'm not expecting you give me a percentage number, but just kind of just give us a sense because I would think that would be kind of the more stable part of your portfolio over the next 12 to 24 months?\nOlivier Le Peuch: As you correctly said, Dave, I think there is a lot of moving parts. The rig projection that we\u2019re using as a proxy for future activity, I think keep moving to the right or keep declining, okay? And we have seen that in the recent weeks. I think we stabilize during the second quarter due to the decision that some OPEC+ member will take, the outcome of their commitment will get clearer. But this being said, as we commented before, when I exclude Russia and China, which have a seasonal effect in the second quarter that is favorable, when I exclude that, the decline of rig activity is low to mid-teens, sequential decline of rig in short-term. The variability of that varies a lot. We said at the -- some of the West Africa, Europe and to a lesser extent, Gulf of Mexico are getting more impacted than we will get in some of the land Middle East activity or even China offshore or Australia, or Qatar offshore that will actually go up.  So there's a lot of moving parts, as you said. But generally speaking, there are pocket of resilience that are either linked to long-term gas oil development offshore and onshore. And some of it could be like in Guyana, some of it could be Qatar gas offshore, some of it can be Deepwater Australia or China offshore or could be land Russia. All of this is making a pocket of resilience that we're trying to benefit from where we either have strong or very strong market position such as in Russia and Qatar offshore, for example. And we'll explore it and leverage these in the second quarter, and some of it where we will be trying to position our performance to get the most out of the activity. So that's the mix going forward. So pockets up and down and that will keep evolving. So that\u2019s the best I can share at this moment, Dave. \nDavid Anderson: I appreciate that. And maybe just a follow up question on your APS portfolio. The last time we went through all this, we had some issues that there is more oil price exposure than I think a lot of us realized. Can you just talk about -- I know that portfolio is a lot smaller today, but how much is tied to the oil price versus the fixed tariffs? And I know payments is kind of a question we have. And maybe you can also just comment on where Ecuador is right now. And when you think operations could resume there? Thanks.\nStephane Biguet: I will take that question, Dave. So on the oil price exposure, it's about half of our APS revenue is on fixed tariff on service fee, while the other half has some element of indexation to oil or the gas prices. On that latter part, the good portion is already at the contractual minimum even with the oil prices we had in the first quarter. So the lower oil prices will not make it worse. All-in-all when you take all of these into account, we are not talking about a significant direct impact on our earnings at the lower oil prices of today. So it's not a significant effect.  On your second question regarding Ecuador, I don't think it's really appropriate for me to speculate on what specific customers will do from a payment standpoint. However, our total receivable balance in Ecuador was below 500 million at the end of March. And we received the timely payments during the quarter. So we will be watching this very closely. But, so far, the quarter was in line. \nOperator: And our next question is from line of Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\nChase Mulvehill: Good morning, Olivier. So I just wanted to ask real quickly about COVID-19 and obviously the impacts it's having today. But if we think longer term, how do you think that the COVID-19 will impact, how you operate over the medium to longer term? I guess kind of what I'm asking here is, do you expect maybe to accelerate any remote operating or automation initiatives or maybe think about how you -- your supply chain if you try to have it less concentrated or maybe a less reliant on China or anything like that. So just kind of structurally, do you see any changes over the medium to longer term as a result of what's happening for COVID-19?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yes, very good question, Chase. So let me first comment on the way, we did react and we did to act and support our operation, our customers during this period. So we actually put in place from mid-January a full crisis management team looking at all aspects. First, and foremost, looking at the way we're protecting the health of our people and managing the support to logistics, supply chain and manufacturing. And we did that for the last three months now, going to full-scale across all organization. And by doing that, we started to mitigate and understand the alternate path we have for logistics. We set up a second source and/or better understand the risk we were having toward some supply exposure, be it in China or elsewhere in the world. And actually we have no disruption. The disruption we had were related to shutdown, states or government mandated in Malaysia or in Italy that we cannot offset. But aside from this we're actually showing extremely good resilience on the logistics, on the movement of people, as we have a lot of people that are in every country, local and we don't -- we do not depend as much as some of our peers and/or some of the operator on to flying team or international commuter in most of the countries where we operate.  So we had extremely good resilience. We did not let our customer down in any rig mobilization or in any product delivery at this point. So I think our resilience from a multiplicity of channel we have used for the second sourcing and the resilience of diversity and edge we have on our supply and manufacturing, I think has been helping us. Now going forward, you are totally right, and I think we have accelerated our remote operation and automation of some of our operations. In the month of March we had more than 60% of our drilling operation that were using remote operation. So we have been exploiting with success the remote operation by reducing the footprint of people on the rig site having very positive impact on HSE, helping and supporting them remotely with an impact on service quality and providing efficiency and cost that benefit both the operator and ourselves.  So this will continue, will accelerate. We have an excellent platform internally and we have our DELFI platform externally, where our clients are starting to adopt drilling in particular remote operation and automation. This is accelerating as we speak.  Another example, Chase is, as we were deploying DELFI and you have now seen that into the earning press release for Woodside, we were getting the request to accelerate due to the COVID-19 restriction, accelerate the deployment of the cloud based infrastructure so that the asset team, the geoscientists of our customer could work from home and have the full access to their data and to their powerful geoscience application. We're able to deploy and accelerate and with great satisfaction and success and this has been -- used as an example going forward. So yes, it will be a differentiation that we\u2019ll use going forward. \nChase Mulvehill: One quick follow-up. Obviously globally we're starting to see some producing wells being shut in and obviously that\u2019s probably going to accelerate over the next couple of month or two. But as we think about these wells that are shut in and as they come back online, could you talk to the impact -- the service activity impact or the revenue that could impact your business as these wells are having to be brought back online maybe in the back half of this year, kind of early in the next year? \nOlivier Le Peuch: It's difficult to say Chase. I think first, I think it's difficult to judge the magnitude of the number of shut-ins. It will depend how fast and how much there will be an excess of supply going into topping the storage tanks. So I think it depends on the reservoir. It depends on the location. But generally speaking, yes, I think every well at the shut-in, when it\u2019s put back needs to get a bit of well management, scaling and stimulation activity. So that will favor the service activity at large whenever it comes back on the campaign of reservicing those wells and providing intervention and stimulation to make them back flowing at their maximum capacity. So that will indeed be a positive, if I may, effect as we exit this very difficult period and we start to recover the full capacity of the oil-producing fields.\nOperator: And our next question is from the line of George O'Leary with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please go ahead.\nGeorge O'Leary : Just wanted to start off on the offshore side. From an offshore perspective, shallow and deepwater rig count activity begins this downturn kind of at lower levels or well off prior cycle peak. So I wondered if you could provide any color on how we should think about Schlumberger's offshore exposure entering this downturn versus prior cycles whether as a percentage of revenue, just some kind of ballpark way to think about offshore exposure for you all?\nOlivier Le Peuch : As you said, I think the -- we have not recovered far from it, the level of activity we have deepwater before the previous downturn. The deepwater, particularly in the floating -- floater market has been recovering maybe 10% to 20% from the trough, that's about it for the last three years. There was being -- there has been more rebounds, albeit not fully recovered on the shallow water market. So obviously it is big part of our international portfolio as this is key to the industry. How do I see it forward? I think I believe that the deepwater will decline as much as the shallow, albeit I think it will not decline to the magnitude that it had in the last downturn, there is not so much to give, and quite a few large projects that are active today that will continue to operate. So I see both shallow and deepwater declining in the months to come. And I think the indication and the number I shared before double-digit to mid-teens decline sequentially apply to both actually. And I think we will manage it, but I don't think that it will be the same magnitude far from it, particularly for the deepwater.\nGeorge O'Leary : And then secondarily, just aside from now having Cameron in the fold and you guys sold the marine seismic vessels businesses and there's been a lot of changes and you guys have been doing kind of Yeoman's work to structurally change the business and become more fixed cost CapEx light. But what notable way should we think about the Schlumberger portfolio being different, i.e., more resilient entering this downturn versus prior down cycles?\nOlivier Le Peuch : I think a major part of it will come from our exposure in North America where we have made a decision to accelerate the new strategy, scale-to-fit, and also asset-light technology access. That's a major element of resilience in this downturn that will impact positively our way forward. And second, I would say is our digital strategy that I think we have invested into the last downturn to give us the benefit and certainly that will be leveraged with what has happened with remote operation automation. And the combination of executing our asset-light, particularly in North America and any, I would say, high volume basins, and some of it will be in the overseas and Middle East or in China or elsewhere where we will accelerate our technology access asset-light strategy and digital will complement this. So I believe that going forward we will gain better resilience from our exposure and support from digital and asset-light to technology access.\nOperator: And next we have a question from Chris Voie with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nChris Voie : I wanted to ask about the international margin side. So if you look back to the last downturn, 2014 plus, margins, it looks like held in quite well in the first year after the decline in activity, but then there was a pretty meaningful decline in 2016 as that year reflected more the new work that was awarded at lower prices and also cost absorption. Going into this one, if we assume a similar setup where most of the work that still happens in 2020 has been already awarded, but in 2021 it would be new work, I think it's a little bit different. In that, there's less pricing to give, but potentially less cost available to cut as well. Could you maybe walk through how the margin profile going forward might compare this time around compared to last time?\nOlivier Le Peuch : Yeah. It's difficult to comment until we -- as I said earlier, we get the better clarity on the second half of the exact mix of international adjustments as well as we get more clarity on when the COVID-19 crisis is getting an exit, a steady exit, so that it will give us a better indication on 2021 outlook. But this being said, and you pointed out yourself, I think there is much less pricing concession to concede in this cycle so that will we get a little bit of a different profile of margin compression going forward. I believe that we will be able to fare better in this cycle -- through cycle our margin compression that we have had in the previous one due to a lesser exposure to price decline for one; two, better efficiency including some element of digital in our ability to operate and flex our operating capacity with the activity. And I would say also possibly a better resilience in some of the markets that we mentioned before where we have a stronger position.\nChris Voie : And if I could get in a quick follow-up. In the release, you commented on how many fleets have been reduced in North America through the end of March. I'm wondering if you can give any color on how much further you might have cut at this point? And there's a lot of speculation that fleet count in North America might go extremely low. Just curious if you can give any color on what you're seeing just at the leading edge there?\nOlivier Le Peuch : Yes. We are seeing the frac fleet going low, very low. But I think our trough, we anticipate will still be above 100 fleet we believe going forward. Now we will not recover from that going forward. We see some models arguing that the fleet count will go as low as 50 or 60 for the full market. We don't believe this will be the case, at least what we see and the indication we have. And we are aiming to maintain 10 to 15 or 10 to 12 fleet as a minimum operating into that environment and to have them active and deploying them to our fit strategy to the basin we favor and to the customer we believe are recognizing the performance we bring.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one final question from Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nConnor Lynagh : I'm wondering if you could help me reconcile, it seems like based on your sequential activity commentary and your full year commentary that you expect the vast majority of the activity reductions to occur in second quarter. Is that correct? And is that correct for both North America and international markets?\nOlivier Le Peuch : Yes. I think at the current assumption with the visibility we have, I think there is a sharp decline. As I said, this quarter is the worst in terms of decline rate that the industry I think possibly would have ever seen in North America clearly and internationally possibly. There will be further adjustments in the second half of the year in some markets, international markets as well as maybe final rounding in North America. But I believe that the most decline is happening this quarter and will stabilize over the summer. So yes, I think the indication we gave I think are certainly helping us to be with lesser decline and more stable environment from the exit rate of Q2 into the second half at this point.\nConnor Lynagh : Okay. That's fair. And in that context, it certainly seems like you guys have been proactive on cost management thus far. But relative to historical decrementals, should we think about second quarter being a bit higher relative to usual, just given all that's going on and maybe mitigating from there or how would you think about the path?\nOlivier Le Peuch : I think commenting on -- as I said earlier, giving you guidance on the second quarter from the top-line first is difficult because international markets has a level of disruption, 3% to 5% possible on the rig disruption due to restriction for the COVID-19 combined with some decision on the -- of change of tack with some national company that will have to adapt the new OPEC+ voluntary cuts, it is making the top-line very difficult to predict in the second quarter. And when it comes to the bottom-line, I think the abruptness of the adjustment can be and will be coped with to some extent North America, but the lag into the ability to reduce the cost internationally is not the same due to many factors. Hence, the decremental in the next quarter will certainly be -- not be as good as we have historically done in a downturn. Now through the cycle, I think our ambition is to fare better for the reason I mentioned before. But in the second quarter, I think it will be a messy quarter at large from a activity prediction and our ability to adjust our cost structure or to react and to leverage the opportunity we have also to uplift and get the most when there is an opportunity to upside and there will be upside.\nOlivier Le Peuch : Thank you. So I believe with this, I think we need to close. So let me conclude by reiterating some key take away from this call. Firstly, I believe that the company performed well during the first quarter despite a very challenging environment with excellent resilience and performance across operations, particularly in international market and a very respectable financial results, particularly in the cash flow from operation. I feel very proud of the Schlumberger team who have delivered this under such stressful conditions. Secondly, as we were presented with growing uncertainty on global economic outlook and a fast deteriorating commodity price, we acted swiftly, reducing our capital spend program significantly, accelerating our scale-to-fit strategy approach in North America and taking exceptional measure to protect our cash and liquidity for the second quarter and beyond. Thirdly, and after in-depth review of forward-looking scenarios, we decided to adjust the dividend to a new level, as a prudent capital management decision, providing us with the liquidity and financial flexibility we need considering the significant uncertainty in the quarter to come. Finally, as we navigate this unprecedented industry downturn, we continue to prioritize key element of our strategy, namely the capital stewardship initiative to protect the company's financial strength, the fit-for-basin strategy to increase the performance impact in key basins for our customers and create sustainable differentiation. And finally, the acceleration of the industry\u2019s digital transformation to support higher efficiency, efficiency gains in operation for our customers and for our own success. May everyone stay safe and healthy. Thank you for your attention.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation.

            "name": "Stephane Biguet",
            "content": "Thank you, Olivier. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for participating in this conference call. First quarter earnings per share excluding charges and credits was $0.25. This represents a decrease of $0.14 sequentially and $0.05 when compared to the same quarter of last year. During the quarter, we recorded $8.5 billion of pre-tax charges driven by current market conditions and valuations. These charges primarily relate to goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets. As such, this charge is almost entirely non-cash. You can find details of its components in the FAQs at the end of our earnings press release. These impairments were all recorded as of the end of March. Therefore, the first quarter results did not include any benefit from reduced depreciation and amortization expense as a result of these charges. However, going forward, depreciation and amortization expense will be reduced by approximately $95 million on a quarterly basis. However, going forward, depreciation and amortization expense will be reduced by approximately $95 million on a quarterly basis. Approximately $45 million of this will be reflected in the Production segment. The remaining $50 million will be reflected in the \u2018Corporate and other' line item. The quarterly after-tax impact of these reductions is approximately $0.06 in EPS terms. I will now summarize the main drivers of our first quarter results. I will not go into much detail as Olivier already provided some key highlights, but I will spend more time updating you on our liquidity position. Overall, our first quarter revenue of $7.5 billion decreased 9% sequentially. Pre-tax segment operating margins decreased 181 basis points to 10.4%. First quarter Reservoir Characterization revenue of $1.3 billion decreased 20% sequentially, while margins decreased 839 basis points to 14%. The sequential drop was a combination of seasonal effects and early signs of customer curtailing discretionary expenditures. Drilling revenue of $2.3 billion decreased 6%, while margins were flat at 12.4%. Approximately half of that revenue decline was due to the divestiture of our Fishing & Remedial Tools business at the end of the fourth quarter. Production revenue of $2.7 billion decreased 6% sequentially, and margins declined 98 basis points to 7.8%. Cameron revenue of $1.3 billion decreased 10%, while margins slightly increased by 57 basis points to 9.7%. Our effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits was 17% in the first quarter as compared to 16% in the previous quarter. Please note that it is going to be challenging to provide guidance around our effective tax rate going forward as discussed in further detail in the FAQ at the end of our earnings release.  Let me now turn to our liquidity. During the first quarter, we generated $784 million of cash flow from operations. As Olivier mentioned, this is more than double what we generated during the same quarter last year. We spent $407 million on CapEx and invested $163 million in Asset Performance Solutions or APS projects.  We completed the sale of our interest in the Bandurria Sur Block in Argentina during the quarter. The net proceeds from this transaction combined with the proceeds we received from the divestiture of a smaller APS project, amounted to about $300 million. Looking forward, after considering the Argentina divestiture and reduction in the rest of our project portfolio, our APS investments for the full year will not exceed $500 million. With this, as well as the significant reduction of our operating CapEx engaged during the quarter, our total capital spend for 2020 including APS and multi-client will now be approximately $1.8 billion. This represents close to a 35% decrease as compared to 2019.  On the balance sheet side, we took a series of steps during the first quarter to reinforce our liquidity position. First, we ended the quarter with total cash and investments of $3.3 billion. While this cash balance is higher than what we generally like to carry, this was a conscious decision and I am very comfortable with it considering the current situation. Our net debt increased by only $171 million during the quarter, closing at $13.3 billion, which is more than $1 billion lower than the level we were at a year ago. During the first quarter, we issued EUR400 million of notes due in 2027 and another EUR400 million of notes due in 2031. These notes carry a weighted average interest rate of 2% after being swapped into U.S. dollars. We also renewed during the quarter our revolving credit facilities. These committed facilities amount to a total of $6.25 billion and do not mature until between February 2023 and February 2025. We ended the quarter with $2.7 billion of commercial paper borrowings outstanding. Therefore, after considering the $3.3 billion of cash on hand, we had $6.8 billion of liquidity available to us at the end of the quarter. In addition, we entered last week into another committed revolving credit facility for EUR1.2 billion. This is a one year facility that can be extended at our option for up to another year. We can also upsize the facility for syndication. To-date, we have not drawn on this facility. Finally, our short-term credit ratings, which are critical to maintain our privileged access to the commercial paper markets, were just recently reaffirmed by both Standard & Poor's and Moody's. In light of our available liquidity and the various actions undertaken during the quarter, our debt maturity profile over the next 12 months is quite manageable. We only have $500 million of bonds coming due in the fourth quarter of this year and another $600 million coming due in the first quarter of 2021. Our preference is to refinance these obligations with new bonds, markets permitting.  To close, let me come back to what is probably the most important decision of the quarter as it relates to capital allocation. In this environment, our strategic priority is obviously on conserving cash and further protecting our balance sheet. To this end, we have taken the prudent decision to reduce our quarterly dividend by 75%. The revised dividend still supports our shareholder value proposition by maintaining both a healthy yield and a reasonable payout ratio as we navigate these uncertain times. It also allows for prudent organic investment, while maintaining the self-discipline required under the capital stewardship program that we have committed to.  Finally, it gives us flexibility to adjust our capital return policy in the future whether through increased dividends or stock buybacks when operating and business conditions improve.  I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier. You've covered all. Thank you. For the upcoming maturities, at least in the next 12 months, as I said, we are pretty well spaced and the amounts are quite reasonable. So really what we will do is, our objective is to refinance the maturities with new bonds or if cash permits we will pay down some of that debt to maintain the credit rating that we are targeting. And what we are targeting is really to ensure that we keep a strong investment grade credit in this cyclical environment. So, this will really be the way we will deal with the upcoming maturities, if that answer your question. Yes, Scott. We indeed expect to see our working capital winding down over the next few quarters as activity reduces. Now the magnitude of that working capital really is dependent on several factors of course, and probably the most significant -- you're asking about lessons learned here -- is the pace of cash collections we receive from our customers. So immediately as we saw the environment deteriorating, we refocused our entire organization on cash collections and you've seen the early signs of this through our cash flow performance in Q1. So now, as much as we are working to prevent it, we could see payments being delayed over the next few quarters. But we will keep a very close eye on this.  Now, we may see some offsets to the positive working capital effects from restructuring cash costs as we continue to adjust our structure. But definitely we will see from a normal working capital trend, we will see a release. Yes. So on the working capital, you're right. The first year of the previous downturn we did have a consumption from the receivables. And again, we'll try to prevent this. We know the hotspots. And we keep a close eye on it, but it's -- there are some places where payments can be delayed for sure.  On the D&A, yes, I did say $95 million. It's pre-tax, obviously, and it's compared to the first quarter of this year. So $95 million, lower D&A going forward from Q1 2020 reference. I will take that question, Dave. So on the oil price exposure, it's about half of our APS revenue is on fixed tariff on service fee, while the other half has some element of indexation to oil or the gas prices. On that latter part, the good portion is already at the contractual minimum even with the oil prices we had in the first quarter. So the lower oil prices will not make it worse. All-in-all when you take all of these into account, we are not talking about a significant direct impact on our earnings at the lower oil prices of today. So it's not a significant effect.  On your second question regarding Ecuador, I don't think it's really appropriate for me to speculate on what specific customers will do from a payment standpoint. However, our total receivable balance in Ecuador was below 500 million at the end of March. And we received the timely payments during the quarter. So we will be watching this very closely. But, so far, the quarter was in line."

            "name": "Olivier Le Peuch",
            "content": "Thank you, Simon, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I hope everyone is safe and well. This morning I'm going to comment on three topics: our Q1 performance; how we are managing in today's increasingly difficult operating environment; and how we see the outlook for the second quarter.  Before I do that, I would first like to thank the Schlumberger people around the world who are demonstrating great resilience and adaptability. I'm very proud of our team and of what they have achieved in the first quarter. Despite the complications from COVID-19 outbreak, they delivered strong organizational performance throughout the quarter. We kept very close to our customer as the crisis developed and we were able to maintain well site operations with only minimal disruption across a few countries. The feedback I've received from our customers has been both positive and appreciative of our operational performance. Despite the difficulty of the situation and the duress under which our people have been working, Q1 was one of the best quarter in terms of service quality and actually the best quarter ever in safety performance. Let's start with the perspective on our first quarter results. The resilience of our performance given the COVID-19 related disruption and the early impact of the oil price collapse, delivered earnings of $0.25 per share; only marginally short of our original expectation. The quarter was characterized by the usual combination of seasonal impact in the Northern Hemisphere and the sequential decline of product and software sales. However, toward the end of the quarter, activity started to decline in several basins due to the unprecedented drop in oil price and the increasing challenges posed by COVID-19. The most severe impact was in North America land where customers were fast to react with a sharp 17% cut in rig count. In our business segments, Reservoir Characterization revenue closed the quarter sequentially down 20%, partly on seasonal effects but also as a consequence of customers curtailing their discretionary and exploration spending in the latter part of the quarter. The margins declined on the absence of significant multi-client software license sales, weak exploration mix and lower contribution from discretionary software sales. Drilling revenue declined sequentially on seasonal effects and the collapse in North America late in the quarter, but displayed resilience with margins flat sequentially on our operational execution and our focus on underperforming business units as well as continued success in our technology access strategy. Production revenue declined on lower activity in international markets and weaker Asset Performance Solutions (APS) results. While Production margin declined 100 basis points driven by the weaker international activity, the success of our OneStim\u00ae scale-to-fit strategy in North America matched resource to market needs and optimize our operational footprint. Cameron revenue was seasonally lower and suffered from the exposure of the short-cycle business to North America. International Cameron revenue was also lower as we halted manufacturing in Italy and Malaysia in response to local restrictions to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Despite these negative effects, Cameron margin increased sequentially, driven largely by this quarter's favorable mix in the OneSubsea\u00ae portfolio.  Looking at North America land in more detail, the timely acceleration of our NAL strategy protected margins from excessive sequential decline. We began the quarter having scaled our OneStim fleet to fit the market, which resulted in higher utilization and minimal frac calendar gaps. However, as oil price began to collapse in March, customers rapidly dropped rigs and frac crews. Along with well construction and completion activity decreasing, the technology mix switched from driving performance to saving costs. We reacted rapidly by stacking frac fleets to protect our margins and had reduced capacity by more than 27% and reduced our CapEx plan by 60% by the end of the quarter. In contrast, our international revenue close to 2% ahead year-on-year or 4% when accounting for the 2019 business divestitures. Growth was resilient in key Schlumberger markets across Russia & Central Asia, Saudi Arabia & Bahrain, Far East Asia & Australia, Northern Middle East, Latin America North, and Norway & Denmark. Our first quarter cash flow from operations more than doubled year-on-year to $784 million as a result of our heightened focus on collections and our resilience in key international markets. Let me now talk about what we are doing to protect the company and how we have focused on cash, liquidity and the strength of our balance sheet in a period of high uncertainty as the depth and extent of the coronavirus impact on global oil demand remains unknown. First, and after an in-depth review of the possible outcomes of the new oil order we are facing, we have made the very difficult but necessary decision to reduce our dividend by 75%. This will protect our cash and liquidity in the current environment, while giving us greater flexibility going forward. We will continue to exercise stringent capital stewardship, while retaining the ability to balance any capital return to shareholders as operational conditions evolve. Second, we have reduced our capital investment program by more than 30% across CapEx, APS and multi-client. We're also reducing our research and engineering investment by more than 20% in the second quarter to reflect the necessary adjustment to our 2020 commercialization program. Further, we have accelerated and increased our structural cost reduction in North America in alignment with the scale-to-fit strategy initiated during the fourth quarter adjusted for the new environment. As a result, we unfortunately had to reduce our workforce in North America by close to 1,500 people during the first quarter.  We will continue to decisively implement structural change during the second quarter both in North America and internationally to align our cost base with the anticipated short-term and second half activity outlook with full understanding that the pace and scale of decline is still uncertain, but will be more abrupt than during any recent downturn. Finally, we have also taken exceptional temporary measures to conserve cash by implementing furloughs across many parts of organization, both in North America and internationally, and by reducing compensation for the executive team and for the Board of Directors. The result of these actions represents a significant step towards protecting the company cash and liquidity in the face of the significant uncertainties. I believe that our response so far has been swift and effective as demonstrated by our margin and cash flow performance during the first quarter, while providing service to all of our customers with unique resilience and performance across all basins.  Stephane will discuss the strength of our balance sheet, our access to liquidity and our capital investment program in more detail in a few minutes. Before that, let me give you our perspective for the second quarter. Despite the recent agreement by the world's largest oil producers to cut production, Q2 is likely to be the most uncertain and disruptive quarter that the industry has ever seen. We are therefore not in a position to provide guidance for the next quarter as we face two degrees of uncertainty beyond the severe impact of oil demand contraction and the level of commodity oil price. First, it is very difficult to model or predict the frequency or magnitude of the COVID-19 disruption on field operations. Second, it is too early to judge the impact of the recent OPEC+ decision on the level of international activity, as well as its repercussion on storage level globally and the related risks of production shut-ins. Let me however share our view on the key activity trends, starting with North America. We anticipate both rig activity and frac completion activity to continue to decline sharply during the second quarter to reach a sequential decline of 40% to 60%, which matches the full year budget adjustment guidance shared by most operators in North America land. This would represent the most severe decline in drilling and completion activity in a single quarter in several decades.  Internationally, we see a less severe sequential decline as some long-cycle offshore and land development markets should remain relatively resilient and will partially offset the exploration activity drop, as well as the expected activity adjustments that would result from the OPEC+ decision. Directionally, at this time, and excluding the seasonal rebound of rig activity in Russia and China, the international rig count is expected to decline by low to mid-teens sequentially. However, this will vary greatly by basin and per customer. We have been successful during the first quarter in providing the market with resilience and performance. We anticipate building on this success, and will fully leverage our unique international franchise to retain optimum activity mix going forward. As the quarter develops and we get more clarity on the timing and shape of demand recovery and better understand the OPEC+ deal's implementation and compliance, we will be able to discuss our outlook for the second half of the year with you. Let me conclude by reinforcing the enormity of the task ahead. It will require levels of response and depths of resilience that are yet to be fully realized. The actions we have taken so far have been focused on those things we can control in protecting our business with a clear priority on cash and liquidity in an uncertain industry and global environment. We'll continue to take the steps necessary to protect the safety and health of our people and pursue our ambition to be the performance partner of choice for our customers.  The future of our industry poses difficult challenges for people and for the environment, but continues to offer a unique opportunity. I believe that the resilience and performance of our people, our technology leadership and our financial strength will clearly position us for success as the industry rebounds from this unprecedented downturn. On to you, Stephane. Thank you, Stephane. Thank you for this clarification. So ladies and gentlemen, I think we will open the floor for Q&A at this point. So, James, as you know, we have -- as part of the strategy, reaffirmed our capital stewardship program and that's a strategic step -- and I think under that umbrella we did reaffirm our priority for our capital allocation. And our cash from -- free cash flow from operation typically will be directed towards three buckets. The first one, to maintain and support our ongoing operation and that's part of what we do in the essential of under strict capital allocation for the CapEx. The second one, being obviously to maintain the strength of our balance sheet and to address the debt level that we need to maintain the right ratio. And finally, the dividend. Any excess cash beyond that, I think will be directed towards either business opportunity that represent an accretive return to our capital under the new program of capital stewardship or return distribution to the shareholder in the form of buyback or in the form of future increase of our dividend. That's the way we will continue to use the framework under these conditions. Stephane, do you want to add anything? Operator, we lost Sean. Sean, we have been -- on a continuous basis, we have been using bonds to refinance the maturities that are upcoming. I think we need -- as you heard Stephane today, we have two new bond that were issued during the first quarter in euro that were swapped back to dollar. And I think we had done that all along as part of our program and this was reviewed during the finance committee and there was an envelope agreed and approved by the board going forward to refinance a large amount and go after the bond market to address those. And we are confident with the current investment grade we have that we'll be successful in tapping in those markets. Angie, good morning. So first I think I'll stay quite generic in the statement I would make on purpose, because I think there is a lot of uncertainty into the level of outlook activity wise in the second half of the year. We are starting to understand where the quarter will land this quarter in North America and we are taking actions to address and right-size organization and I talked about 40% to 60%. So, you can understand that the organization will be adjusted towards that end. And I think it will affect more or less across all product lines. OneStim will be certainly rightsized on the high end of that framework. And we certainly have to execute faster the strategy of right-sizing or scale-to-fit as we call it, and when talking about the structure costs and the fixed structure costs, that's where we'll put some effort to make sure that the restructure and the fit-for-basin and the hub concentration we are putting for OneStim in the next few months will be addressed first and foremost in parallel with the variable cost action that we're taking.  So North America is fairly clear because activity's direction and drop of activity is already well understood. Internationally, I think it varies a lot from one geography to the next. And there is still a lot of uncertainty, partly with regard to the decision by the national company to cut -- the extent to which they will cut or not. So we are more prudent in our approach internationally, but we are as well executing there and doing both the structure -- fixed structure and as well as variable in the coming weeks. So to give you a number, I don't think there's a number we can quote. The number will keep evolving, but it will be likely to be in excess of $1 billion to just talk about compensation going forward on an annual basis. And this number will certainly change as we go forward.  So all-in-all, we continue to follow the curve, as we call it, albeit this year it's steeper and evolving faster. And we're addressing both the fixed and the variable as we have done in previous downturns. So Kurt, I think the reason why we have such a margin decline is due to two factors. The first is the fact that we had a severe top-line decline of 20% sequentially. That's unusual but it was on the low side of what we -- on the high side, what we typically see seasonally. And I think there are decrementals associated with this.  Secondly, there were a few disruptions during the quarter that added to the cost that could not be recovered during the quarter. And third and maybe the most important one I think is that the decision by the operator to start to tighten purse in the later part of the quarter did impact, what is typically making the quarter -- in the first quarter which is the sales of multi-client license, license sale and also the discretionary software.  So the Q1 is typically a low quarter for margin in Reservoir Characterization, seasonal effect. But this was compounded by the severity of the curtailment of spend in the latter part in the last six weeks of the quarter that's impacted what typically contributes positively to our Q1 quarter or any quarter which is the end of the quarter sales for software or for multi-client. So, we expect this to continue indeed, however, we expect the seasonal effect to recover somewhat, albeit the exploration budget will be lower by about 40% from last year, that's the estimate from our engagement with the customer. There was -- there are two factors that did influence, one positive and one negative in the quarter and one of them will continue. So the negative factor impacted the Cameron margin related to the short-cycle impacting North America declining more than we had anticipated and this decline will continue. We are taking action to maintain or to control the decremental on that aspect. And the second factor was favorable mix in the OneSubsea long-cycle business. So the mix of these will continue going forward. We expect this to be slightly declining in the second quarter, because we see more decline in North America as was clearly highlighted in this call. And the favorable mix of OneSubsea will not repeat in the same magnitude for the next quarter. However, we still feel that the long-term backlog we have in OneSubsea and to some extent in the new award we got in long-lead drilling will support sustaining the margin somehow in the long-term. As you correctly said, Dave, I think there is a lot of moving parts. The rig projection that we're using as a proxy for future activity, I think keep moving to the right or keep declining, okay? And we have seen that in the recent weeks. I think we stabilize during the second quarter due to the decision that some OPEC+ member will take, the outcome of their commitment will get clearer. But this being said, as we commented before, when I exclude Russia and China, which have a seasonal effect in the second quarter that is favorable, when I exclude that, the decline of rig activity is low to mid-teens, sequential decline of rig in short-term. The variability of that varies a lot. We said at the -- some of the West Africa, Europe and to a lesser extent, Gulf of Mexico are getting more impacted than we will get in some of the land Middle East activity or even China offshore or Australia, or Qatar offshore that will actually go up.  So there's a lot of moving parts, as you said. But generally speaking, there are pocket of resilience that are either linked to long-term gas oil development offshore and onshore. And some of it could be like in Guyana, some of it could be Qatar gas offshore, some of it can be Deepwater Australia or China offshore or could be land Russia. All of this is making a pocket of resilience that we're trying to benefit from where we either have strong or very strong market position such as in Russia and Qatar offshore, for example. And we'll explore it and leverage these in the second quarter, and some of it where we will be trying to position our performance to get the most out of the activity. So that's the mix going forward. So pockets up and down and that will keep evolving. So that's the best I can share at this moment, Dave. Yes, very good question, Chase. So let me first comment on the way, we did react and we did to act and support our operation, our customers during this period. So we actually put in place from mid-January a full crisis management team looking at all aspects. First, and foremost, looking at the way we're protecting the health of our people and managing the support to logistics, supply chain and manufacturing. And we did that for the last three months now, going to full-scale across all organization. And by doing that, we started to mitigate and understand the alternate path we have for logistics. We set up a second source and/or better understand the risk we were having toward some supply exposure, be it in China or elsewhere in the world. And actually we have no disruption. The disruption we had were related to shutdown, states or government mandated in Malaysia or in Italy that we cannot offset. But aside from this we're actually showing extremely good resilience on the logistics, on the movement of people, as we have a lot of people that are in every country, local and we don't -- we do not depend as much as some of our peers and/or some of the operator on to flying team or international commuter in most of the countries where we operate.  So we had extremely good resilience. We did not let our customer down in any rig mobilization or in any product delivery at this point. So I think our resilience from a multiplicity of channel we have used for the second sourcing and the resilience of diversity and edge we have on our supply and manufacturing, I think has been helping us. Now going forward, you are totally right, and I think we have accelerated our remote operation and automation of some of our operations. In the month of March we had more than 60% of our drilling operation that were using remote operation. So we have been exploiting with success the remote operation by reducing the footprint of people on the rig site having very positive impact on HSE, helping and supporting them remotely with an impact on service quality and providing efficiency and cost that benefit both the operator and ourselves.  So this will continue, will accelerate. We have an excellent platform internally and we have our DELFI platform externally, where our clients are starting to adopt drilling in particular remote operation and automation. This is accelerating as we speak.  Another example, Chase is, as we were deploying DELFI and you have now seen that into the earning press release for Woodside, we were getting the request to accelerate due to the COVID-19 restriction, accelerate the deployment of the cloud based infrastructure so that the asset team, the geoscientists of our customer could work from home and have the full access to their data and to their powerful geoscience application. We're able to deploy and accelerate and with great satisfaction and success and this has been -- used as an example going forward. So yes, it will be a differentiation that we'll use going forward. It's difficult to say Chase. I think first, I think it's difficult to judge the magnitude of the number of shut-ins. It will depend how fast and how much there will be an excess of supply going into topping the storage tanks. So I think it depends on the reservoir. It depends on the location. But generally speaking, yes, I think every well at the shut-in, when it's put back needs to get a bit of well management, scaling and stimulation activity. So that will favor the service activity at large whenever it comes back on the campaign of reservicing those wells and providing intervention and stimulation to make them back flowing at their maximum capacity. So that will indeed be a positive, if I may, effect as we exit this very difficult period and we start to recover the full capacity of the oil-producing fields. As you said, I think the -- we have not recovered far from it, the level of activity we have deepwater before the previous downturn. The deepwater, particularly in the floating -- floater market has been recovering maybe 10% to 20% from the trough, that's about it for the last three years. There was being -- there has been more rebounds, albeit not fully recovered on the shallow water market. So obviously it is big part of our international portfolio as this is key to the industry. How do I see it forward? I think I believe that the deepwater will decline as much as the shallow, albeit I think it will not decline to the magnitude that it had in the last downturn, there is not so much to give, and quite a few large projects that are active today that will continue to operate. So I see both shallow and deepwater declining in the months to come. And I think the indication and the number I shared before double-digit to mid-teens decline sequentially apply to both actually. And I think we will manage it, but I don't think that it will be the same magnitude far from it, particularly for the deepwater. I think a major part of it will come from our exposure in North America where we have made a decision to accelerate the new strategy, scale-to-fit, and also asset-light technology access. That's a major element of resilience in this downturn that will impact positively our way forward. And second, I would say is our digital strategy that I think we have invested into the last downturn to give us the benefit and certainly that will be leveraged with what has happened with remote operation automation. And the combination of executing our asset-light, particularly in North America and any, I would say, high volume basins, and some of it will be in the overseas and Middle East or in China or elsewhere where we will accelerate our technology access asset-light strategy and digital will complement this. So I believe that going forward we will gain better resilience from our exposure and support from digital and asset-light to technology access. Yeah. It's difficult to comment until we -- as I said earlier, we get the better clarity on the second half of the exact mix of international adjustments as well as we get more clarity on when the COVID-19 crisis is getting an exit, a steady exit, so that it will give us a better indication on 2021 outlook. But this being said, and you pointed out yourself, I think there is much less pricing concession to concede in this cycle so that will we get a little bit of a different profile of margin compression going forward. I believe that we will be able to fare better in this cycle -- through cycle our margin compression that we have had in the previous one due to a lesser exposure to price decline for one; two, better efficiency including some element of digital in our ability to operate and flex our operating capacity with the activity. And I would say also possibly a better resilience in some of the markets that we mentioned before where we have a stronger position. Yes. We are seeing the frac fleet going low, very low. But I think our trough, we anticipate will still be above 100 fleet we believe going forward. Now we will not recover from that going forward. We see some models arguing that the fleet count will go as low as 50 or 60 for the full market. We don't believe this will be the case, at least what we see and the indication we have. And we are aiming to maintain 10 to 15 or 10 to 12 fleet as a minimum operating into that environment and to have them active and deploying them to our fit strategy to the basin we favor and to the customer we believe are recognizing the performance we bring. Yes. I think at the current assumption with the visibility we have, I think there is a sharp decline. As I said, this quarter is the worst in terms of decline rate that the industry I think possibly would have ever seen in North America clearly and internationally possibly. There will be further adjustments in the second half of the year in some markets, international markets as well as maybe final rounding in North America. But I believe that the most decline is happening this quarter and will stabilize over the summer. So yes, I think the indication we gave I think are certainly helping us to be with lesser decline and more stable environment from the exit rate of Q2 into the second half at this point. I think commenting on -- as I said earlier, giving you guidance on the second quarter from the top-line first is difficult because international markets has a level of disruption, 3% to 5% possible on the rig disruption due to restriction for the COVID-19 combined with some decision on the -- of change of tack with some national company that will have to adapt the new OPEC+ voluntary cuts, it is making the top-line very difficult to predict in the second quarter. And when it comes to the bottom-line, I think the abruptness of the adjustment can be and will be coped with to some extent North America, but the lag into the ability to reduce the cost internationally is not the same due to many factors. Hence, the decremental in the next quarter will certainly be -- not be as good as we have historically done in a downturn. Now through the cycle, I think our ambition is to fare better for the reason I mentioned before. But in the second quarter, I think it will be a messy quarter at large from a activity prediction and our ability to adjust our cost structure or to react and to leverage the opportunity we have also to uplift and get the most when there is an opportunity to upside and there will be upside. Thank you. So I believe with this, I think we need to close. So let me conclude by reiterating some key take away from this call. Firstly, I believe that the company performed well during the first quarter despite a very challenging environment with excellent resilience and performance across operations, particularly in international market and a very respectable financial results, particularly in the cash flow from operation. I feel very proud of the Schlumberger team who have delivered this under such stressful conditions. Secondly, as we were presented with growing uncertainty on global economic outlook and a fast deteriorating commodity price, we acted swiftly, reducing our capital spend program significantly, accelerating our scale-to-fit strategy approach in North America and taking exceptional measure to protect our cash and liquidity for the second quarter and beyond. Thirdly, and after in-depth review of forward-looking scenarios, we decided to adjust the dividend to a new level, as a prudent capital management decision, providing us with the liquidity and financial flexibility we need considering the significant uncertainty in the quarter to come. Finally, as we navigate this unprecedented industry downturn, we continue to prioritize key element of our strategy, namely the capital stewardship initiative to protect the company's financial strength, the fit-for-basin strategy to increase the performance impact in key basins for our customers and create sustainable differentiation. And finally, the acceleration of the industry's digital transformation to support higher efficiency, efficiency gains in operation for our customers and for our own success. May everyone stay safe and healthy. Thank you for your attention."

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to ND Maduemezia, the Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nND Maduemezia: Thank you, Lea. Good morning, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited fourth quarter and full-year 2021 earnings conference call. Today's call is being hosted from Houston, following the Schlumberger Limited Board meeting held earlier this week. Joining us on the call are Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Executive Officer; and Stephane Biguet, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind all participants that some of the statements we will be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and our other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our fourth-quarter press release, which is on our website. With that, I will turn the call over to Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, ND. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on the call today. In my prepared remarks, I will cover our Q4 results and full-year 2021 achievements. Thereafter, I will follow with our view of the 2022 outlook and some insights into our near-term financial ambitions. Stephane will then give more detail on our financial results and we will open for your questions. The fourth quarter was characterized by broad-based activity growth. With continued momentum in North America, activity acceleration in the international markets, and an accretive offshore market contribution \u2011\u2011 upon which we delivered strong sequential revenue growth, our sixth consecutive quarter of margin expansion, and outstanding double-digit free cash flow generation. These financial results conclude an exceptional year of financial outperformance for Schlumberger, at a pivotal time for the Company and in our industry at large. Underlying these results are the following highlights from the quarter: Geographically, sequential growth in North America exceeded rig activity, growing in excess of 20% offshore, and international revenue growth accelerated, closing the second half of 2021, up 12% versus the prior year. All international areas posted growth, driven by gains in more than 75% of our international business units. By division, revenue in all four divisions grew sequentially, and when compared to the same period last year. Digital & Integration led growth, posting double-digit sequential growth and record-high margins. Well Construction and Reservoir Performance, our predominantly service-oriented divisions, outperformed expectations with strong sequential growth and approximately 30% growth year-over-year on a pro-forma basis. Production Systems recorded year-end sales, which drove mid-single digit growth, though partially impacted by logistics challenges. Operating margins expanded in spite of seasonality effects, improving further beyond prepandemic levels. And finally, we generated outstanding cash flow from operations \u2011\u2011 exceeding $1.9 billion in the quarter. All in all, I am very pleased with our operational execution, our safety performance, and our financial results through the fourth quarter. Now let me briefly reflect on what we achieved in 2021. In our core, we fully operationalized our returns-focused strategy, leveraging our new division and basin organization to seize the start of the upcycle. In North America, this resulted in full-year topline revenue growth, excluding the effects of divestures, and significantly expanded margins \u2011\u2011 achieving double digits, one of the financial targets we laid out in 2019. Internationally, we also grew the top-line and expanded margins significantly, as international activity strengthened in the second half of the year. This also resulted in full-year international margins that exceeded 2019 levels. Taken together, these margins resulted in the highest global operating margins of the last six years, setting an excellent foundation for further expansion, as activity accelerates and market conditions further support pricing improvement. In Digital, our second engine of growth, I am very proud of the momentum we established during the year. We advanced on our goals to expand market access and accelerate adoption of our platform, AI capabilities, and powerful digital tools to reduce cycle time, improve performance, and lower carbon intensity. We built partnerships to achieve comprehensive cloud access globally, collaborated with AI innovators to deploy machine-learning and AI solutions, and enabled digital operations through the automation of key workflows in well construction and production operations. At the end of 2021, we have more than 240 commercial DELFI customers, recorded more than 160% DELFI user growth year over year, and saw a more than tenfold increase in compute-cycle intensity on our DELFI cloud platform. We also made significant progress in our data business streams and digital operations \u2011\u2011 advancing our OSDU commercial offerings, autonomous drilling, and the adoption of Agora Edge AI and IOT solutions with great success. The Q4 results, including significant uptake in digital sales and sizeable incremental margins, are a clear testament of this success. In Schlumberger New Energy, we continued to advance the development of clean energy technologies and low-carbon projects. In 2021, we took a position in stationary energy storage, expanding our total addressable market, and advanced all of our ventures in hydrogen, lithium, geoenergy, and a suite of CCUS opportunities, including our bioenergy CCS project. Some notable milestones achieved include the signature of pilot agreements with Genvia, our hydrogen venture, with ArcelorMittal, Ugitech, Vicat, and Hynamics \u2011\u2011 leading companies in steel and cement. And in Celsius, our geoenergy venture, we secured five commercial contracts in Europe and one in North America for a prestigious university campus. This was also a pivotal year for us in terms of our commitment to sustainability. We announced our comprehensive 2050 net-zero commitment, inclusive of Scope 3 emissions, and launched the Transition Technologies portfolio to focus on the decarbonization of oil and gas operations with much success. In addition, Schlumberger earned an AA rating by MSCI, and won an ESG Top Performer Award by Hart Energy, recognizing our sustainability efforts, our enhanced disclosures, and our commitment to apply our technologies and capabilities towards helping the world meet future energy demand. In summary, 2021 was a great year for Schlumberger. Beyond these operational and financial results and our ESG accomplishments, we made excellent progress in our core, digital, and new energy: the three engines of growth that support our success now and well into the future. Above all, I am most proud of our people \u2011\u2011 their unique ability to execute, remobilizing operations across the world through numerous pandemic constraints, adapting to logistics and supply-chain dynamics, and setting new performance benchmarks \u2011\u2011 all of which earned the recognition of our customers. I would like to thank the entire team for delivering a year of outperformance on every metric. They surpassed all of our targets this year and created excellent momentum as we enter 2022, for which I would like now to share our outlook. Looking ahead, we have increased confidence in our view of robust multiyear market growth. Tight oil supply and demand growth beyond the prepandemic peak, are projected to result in a substantial step up in capital spending \u2011\u2011 amid shrinking spare capacity, declining inventory balances, and supportive oil prices. In addition, we expect more pervasive service pricing improvements in response to market conditions as technology adoption increases while service capacity tightens. In essence, 2022 will be a period of stronger short-cycle activity resurgence, driven by improved visibility in the demand recovery and greater confidence in the oil price environment. And as oil demand exceeds prepandemic levels in 2023 and beyond, long-cycle development will augment capital spending growth in response to the current supply. This demand-led capital spending growth sets the foundation for a strong multiyear upcycle. Indeed, this scenario is already being established, as the number of FIDs increases, service pricing has begun to improve, and multiyear long-cycle capacity expansion plans have started \u2011\u2011 particularly internationally and offshore \u2011\u2011 as seen during the last quarter. Turning to 2022, more specifically, we expect an increase in capital spending of at least 20% in North America, impacting both the onshore and offshore markets, while internationally, capital spending is projected to increase in the low-to-mid teens, building momentum from a very strong exit in the second half of 2021. All areas and operating environments \u2011\u2011 short- and long-cycle, including deepwater \u2011\u2011 are expected to post strong growth, with upside potential as Omicron disruptions dissipate as the year advances. In this scenario, increased activity and pricing will drive simultaneous double-digit growth \u2011\u2011 both internationally and in North America \u2011\u2011 that will lead our overall 2022 revenue growth to reach mid-teens. Our ambition is to, once again, expand operating and EBITDA margins on a full-year basis, exiting the year with EBITDA margins at least 200 bps higher than the fourth quarter of 2021. In this context, let me share how we see the year unfolding. Directionally, while we are still experiencing COVID-related disruptions, we anticipate typical seasonality in the first quarter, with revenue and margin progression similar to historical sequential trends, which will be seen most prominently in Digital & Integration. This will be followed by a strong seasonal uptick in the second quarter across all divisions with growth further strengthening through the second half of the year \u2011\u2011 supporting our full-year, mid-teens revenue growth ambition and EBITDA margin expansion. This growth and margin expansion trajectory gives us further confidence that we will reach or exceed our mid-cycle ambition of 25% adjusted EBITDA margin before the end of 2023, leading to adjusted EBITDA that should visibly exceed 2019 levels in dollar terms. With this, I will now turn the call over to Stephane.\nStephane Biguet: Thank you, Olivier and good morning ladies and gentlemen. Fourth quarter earnings per share excluding charges and credits was $0.41. This represents an increase of $0.05 compared to the third quarter of this year and of $0.19 when compared to the same period of last year. In addition, we recorded a net credit of $0.01, bringing GAAP EPS to $0.42. This consisted of a $0.02 gain relating to the sale of a portion of our shares in Liberty Oilfield Services, offset by a $0.01 loss relating to the early repayment of $1 billion of notes. Overall, our fourth quarter revenue of $6.2 billion increased 6% sequentially. All divisions posted sequential growth, led by Digital & Integration. From a geographical perspective, International revenue grew 5%, while North America grew 13%. Pretax operating margins improved 31 basis points sequentially to 15.8% and have increased for six quarters in a row. This sequential margin improvement was driven by very strong digital sales, which helped sustain overall margins, despite seasonality effects in the Northern Hemisphere. Company-wide [adjusted] EBITDA margin remained strong at 22.2%, which was essentially flat sequentially. Let me now go through the fourth quarter results for each division. Fourth-quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $889 million increased 10% sequentially with margins growing by 268 basis points to 37.7%. These increases were driven by significantly higher digital and exploration data licensing sales, which were partly offset by the effects of a pipeline disruption in Ecuador that impacted our APS projects. Reservoir Performance growth further accelerated in the fourth quarter with revenue increasing 8% sequentially to $1.3 billion. This growth was primarily due to higher intervention and stimulation activity in the international offshore markets. Margins were essentially flat at 15.5% as a result of seasonality effects and technology mix, largely driven by the end of summer exploration campaigns in the Northern Hemisphere. Well Construction revenue of $2.4 billion increased 5% sequentially due to higher land and offshore drilling, both in North America and internationally. Margins of 15.4% were essentially flat sequentially as the favorable combination of increased activity and pricing gains was offset by seasonal effects. Finally, Production Systems revenue of $1.8 billion was up 5% sequentially, largely from new offshore projects and year-end sales. However, margins decreased 85 basis points to 9.0%, largely as a result of the impact of delayed deliveries due to global supply and logistic constraints. Now turning to our liquidity. Our cash flow generation during the fourth quarter was outstanding. We delivered $1.9 billion of cash flow from operations and free cash flow of $1.3 billion during the quarter. This was the result of a very strong working capital performance driven by exceptional cash collections and customer advances. Cash flows were further enhanced by the sale of a portion of our shares in Liberty, generating net proceeds of $109 million during the quarter. Following this transaction, we hold a 31% interest in Liberty. On a full-year basis, we generated $4.7 billion of cash flow from operations and $3 billion of free cash flow. We generated more free cash in 2021 than in 2019, despite our revenue being 30% lower. This is largely attributable to our efforts of the last two years relating to the implementation of our capital stewardship program and the high grading of our portfolio. As a result of all of this, we ended the year with net debt of $11.1 billion. This represents an improvement of $2.8 billion compared to the end of 2020. We are proud to say that net debt is now at its lowest level of the last five years. During the [quarter] (corrected by company after the call), we also continued to reduce gross debt by repaying $1 billion dollars of notes that were coming due in May of this year. In total, our gross debt reduced by $2.7 billion in the last 12 months thereby significantly increasing our financial flexibility. Now, looking ahead to 2022. We expect total capital investments, consisting of capex and investments in APS and exploration data, to be approximately $1.9 to $2 billion dollars, as compared to just under $1.7 billion in 2021. This increase will allow us to fully seize the multiyear growth opportunity ahead of us, while still achieving our double-digit free cash flow margin objective. We are entering this growth cycle with a business that is much less capital-intensive as compared to previous cycles. As a reminder, during the last growth cycle of 2009 to 2014, our total capital investment as a percentage of revenue was approximately 12%. We are, therefore, well-positioned to fully reap the benefits of this growth cycle with the potential for enhanced free cash flow margins and return on capital employed. With this backdrop, I would like to emphasize that based on the industry fundamentals and positioning of the Company that Olivier highlighted earlier, our financial outlook for 2022 is very strong. We have high expectations and, in 2022, we expect a \u201ctriple double\u201d consisting of double-digit return on capital employed; double-digit return on sales; and double-digit free cash flow margin. It is worth noting that we have not experienced this combination in a single year since 2015. Finally, I am pleased to announce that we will hold a Capital Markets Day in the second half of the year. This event will allow us the opportunity to provide you with additional details relating to Schlumberger\u2019s strategy and financial objectives. Further information regarding this event will be forthcoming shortly. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Stephane. So I believe that we are ready to turn the call to you for the questions. Thank you.\nOperator: (Operator Instructions) And our first question is from James West with Evercore ISI.\nJames West: So Olivier, I liked your increased confidence in achieving mid-cycle margins sooner rather than later. And I wanted to dig in a bit on why that confidence has increased. Obviously, we're starting at a bit higher level, but the target is a pretty solid target. And I'm curious what are the key drivers around that confidence increase?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, James. Let me explain why we have increased confidence. And I think some part of the answer on this question is in the quality of the results we have delivered in 2021 as a foundation. And next, I believe that the current market conditions are clearly supporting our thesis for double-digit CAGR growth over a few years. So with this backdrop, I think we have, we believe, three or four factors that will help us continue to guide upwards our margin expansion. Firstly, we set a foundation. The foundation we have put in place in the last 18 months, the operating leverage reset, the integration performance execution, and the portfolio high-grading are here to stay. And this was already very visibly impacting the service-oriented divisions of Well Construction and Reservoir Performance, as you have seen throughout the year and particularly the second half of last year. And we saw we obviously have this surpassed already with the 2018 margin performance. Secondly, I think the market mix is set to improve and resonate to our profit of strength. An increased offshore activity mix has already started to happen, and we expect this to only accelerate as the year unfolds and further into 2022. The adoption of technology also is accelerating, as you have seen, including digital, but our fit-for-basin, our Transition Technologies and all the technologies that extract performance for our operations are making an impact today, and are getting further adoption by a customer and giving us a premium. And finally, pricing. Where a year ago, we were talking about green shoot pricing in North America, today we are seeing and we are already recording some of pricing improvements in a broad market condition, both in North America and also internationally, when we are getting awarded new contracts as well as when we have to mobilize and deliver unique technology to our customer. So, as the year develops, we believe that these attributes \u2011\u2011 our foundation, operating leverage, our performance that differentiate our execution give us a premium. Our market mix, our technology adoption, success with customers and finally pricing, giving a tailwind to this will drive and further expand our margin to the 2025 \u2011\u2011 the 25% margin expansion. So it's not about if, but it's about when. And we have gained confidence and we have moved forward our confidence in this into the 2022.\nJames West: Okay, great. That's very clear, Olivier. Maybe a second question for me. As we think about the cycle is really starting to take hold here, how should we think about the cadence of growth? You've given obviously numbers for 2022. But if we think about it by both geography and by division, where do you see the \u2011\u2011 I guess, the biggest growth; where could there be some lagging areas? Like, just a little bit more color on that cadence would be very helpful.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Maybe in one word, the market will be \u2011\u2011 growth will be very broad across all geographies, across all divisions. First, as a backdrop, I think that's what we are realizing and that's quite unique. But I think you have to characterize it first geographically or very high level. I think it's possibly a tale of two halves, with North America leading the uptick of growth. Activity growth in the first half; international further accelerating in the second half. While we did end on the H2 \u2011\u2011 over H2 of 12%. We expect this to be the base in the first half and accelerate further in the second half internationally, so that we are even accelerating into 2023 for international activity. Secondly, I believe that if we have to characterize what will lead and be accretive to growth. I would say America\u2019s land, because of activity uptick, but I will also put offshore environment and Middle East. These are the three engines of growth that will pull this year\u2019s growth to the target ambition we have put up mid-teens. So now, per division, I think the service-oriented divisions of Reservoir Performance and Well Construction will be accretive to this we expect, followed by \u2011\u2011 because they are benefiting from this social environment, they're benefiting from the pricing, and they have strong both NAM and international presence. So they\u2019re benefiting from long-cycle exposure and technology mix favorable. In addition, Production Systems will also see growth, building on the short-cycle exposure to North America and the backlog of contracts that we have won in the last few quarters that will execute towards 2022. Finally on Digital & Integration, it's a two-phase of a division here. We expect the digital to be accretive to our growth, while it will be visibly moderated by a flattish environment for APS production, going forward. So that gives you the mix across the divisions and across the geographies.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Anderson with Barclays.\nDavid Anderson: Good morning, Olivier. So you gave \u2011\u2011 you laid out the margin expansion and kind of how you're going to see that. I have a question on the other side of that, just thinking about mobilization of large tenders. You started up on the Jafurah contract in the Middle East, but I guess, typically what we've seen in the past is \u2011\u2011 in these mobilization periods \u2011\u2011 these kinds of extra costs that get weighed in. I'm just thinking about how that's looking in '22. I mean is that something that you think you're going to have to absorb in '22 and that therefore, \u201823 is sort of another margin uplift there? Or has that improved pricing on some of these contracts, kind of countered some of those mobilizations? I think you had said something about getting better pricing for mobilization. So if you could just comment.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yes. I think, Dave, it's part of the mix of execution that we have. And I think we always mobilize for new projects somewhere in the world. And we are committing to international growth and margin expansion this year. The last quarter was already having a witness of significant new project starts, yet we have marginally improved our margins last quarter, and we have seen the results of the core division. So we did it already. So I think as we accelerate deployments, yes, we are very critically assessing the cost of this start-up. We are working for customers to minimize. We are using our digital operations to remote and optimize our deployment of resources. And we believe that what we have done in the last quarter, we'll continue to do in 2022. So I think directionally, we are still set to improve our margin internationally in 2022, despite \u2011\u2011 and building on this new project \u2011\u2011 so we are very keen to start off this new project. We are very proud of the different contract awards that we won last year. And I think this is part of the mix that we're executing. And the more we \u2011\u2011 the more activity and the more growth \u2011\u2011 we will respond and continue to use efficiency and leverage our operating practice to minimize impact and engage with customers to get full recognition of our investment.\nDavid Anderson: Understood. Okay. On the Digital & Integration side, you grew really nicely in the topline this quarter. I was just curious, is that related to more new sales of customers? Or is it more about the adoption pace of your current customers into the workflow? And I was just wondering, a second here, if you could just tell us how much that digital portion grew this year? I'm assuming it outgrew the 8% overall top line, but if you could provide any color on that, that would be really appreciated.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yes. Let me give you a little bit of color into this. So first, I think if I have to characterize the uptick we've seen in digital sales at the end of the year is not a pure year-end sales effect on one or two large contracts and one or two applications and software sales. It's broad. It's very diverse. It's touch and expand upon the platform strategy that developed different revenue streams. So it's about new DELFI-cloud customers, and you have seen we have announced our progress one more time in last quarter. It's about new revenue monetization in digital operations, including Agora, including drilling, remote operations, and automation. It's about new data business streams where we have been securing contracts for OSDU foundation, where we are the first to commercialize enterprise data management solutions on this OSDU. And it's the follow-through on the enterprise contract that we have won in 2021 or in 2020 on DELFI adoption. So it's significant. It relates to the progress we have made in our platform. It relates to the acceleration of digital adoption by our customer and digital \u2011\u2011 this pursuit of digital transformation by customers. And it translates into an uptick in each and every one of the digital revenue streams we have created and the success from data to workflow and to operations. So it's diverse, it's broad, and it's multifaceted. So it's here to continue to expand. So I'm positive on this because it's not a one-off. Obviously, there is a year-end sales effect there that we're not \u2011\u2011 that would not repeat in the first quarter. But at the same time, something that I see expanding as a platform going forward. And we are in the early innings of this adoption. As we mentioned a quarter ago, we have 1,700 digital customers. And we are in the early innings of deploying and pursuing this large installed base with digital transformation. So it was the first cycle of this digital expansion and digital adoption. Actually, this would continue in 2022 and accelerate beyond.\nOperator: And our next question is from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America.\nChase Mulvehill: So I guess the first question is just kind of around this looming investment cycle that you and I and, hopefully, investors are starting to realize needs to happen. And you had mentioned that you expect a substantial increase in spending this cycle. So maybe you did \u2011\u2011 you framed it a little bit, but could you kind of add a little bit of context about how you see this cycle shaking out? What gives you confidence in it? And what it means for pricing for OFS? The competitive dynamics have obviously changed, especially in international, where it feels like you've got more discipline, less players. And so just kind of frame the cycle and activity and where you see the most opportunity for growth. And then ultimately, what this could mean for pricing this cycle for OFS companies.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Great question. I think the fundamentals, as we see them, have not changed. And actually, some characteristics of the cycle have accelerated \u2011\u2011 have been accentuated in recent months. So the attribute that we put first is the outlook of economic GDP growth that considering the oil intensity and energy intensity will fill and will drive the oil demand as a key attribute beyond the previous peak, no later than at the end of this year, according to the latest projection, and is set to expand visibly beyond not only in 2023, but a few years beyond this. So the first is the macro demand situation is set to be favorable for the next few years. Secondly, I think the supply-demand imbalance and the supply, I would almost call it tardiness that we are facing is pointing not only to an uplift in the commodity price, but also is pointing to investment \u2011\u2011 return to investment across the broad portfolio of our customers. So you have seen it in North America, no surprise. North America is still and will remain structurally smaller than previous cycles due to the capital discipline, but also due to the crunch of supply, including on the services side. Secondly, I think the international underinvestment for the last few years \u2011\u2011 actually, the last down cycle \u2011\u2011 combined with the dip in the last two years is creating conditions for a necessary injection of short-cycle capital and then long cycle capital investment to respond to the supply. So we are seeing growth in North America, albeit a cut, we are seeing a rebound \u2011\u2011 a visible rebound in short and long cycle investments internationally. And I will insist on the long cycle because I believe that both oil capacity is being looked upon by some OPEC members to secure future supply market share, but also the international and majors are investing into their advantage offshore basins and we are seeing not only infill drilling, but we are seeing FID for offshore that are accelerating going forward. So it's a mix of offshore rebound, solid including deepwater, international short cycle, and oil capacity in land, and finally, solid growth in North America. So these are unique conditions that are tightening the capacity and that are creating the underlying pricing improvement conditions.\nChase Mulvehill: Okay, perfect. I appreciate the color. A follow-up to that would be, obviously, with this constructive backdrop for Schlumberger and the OFS industry, you've got a wall of free cash flow coming to you. And so when we look at this, obviously, you did $3 billion of free cash flow last year. And it looks like, over the next two years, that should be growing. So how should we think about returning cash \u2011\u2011 how Schlumberger is going to return cash to shareholders? And then how does M&A fit into this capital allocation strategy? Because, obviously, you're trying to reshape the company for new energy ventures and things like that as well.\nStephane Biguet: Chase, it's Stephane. Look, I like your expression on free cash flow. It was indeed quite strong last year with $3 billion. Now indeed, we visibly accelerated the deleveraging of our balance sheet \u2011\u2011 but we are not quite there yet at the leverage ratio we committed to. So we have a clear line of sight now to achieving the target leverage we announced earlier, even though there's still some uncertainty remaining at the start of the year. Nevertheless, with the market fundamentals consolidating, particularly in the second half of the year and into 2023, we have even more confidence indeed now in generating significant excess cash this year and beyond. So we will be able to maintain quite a healthy balance sheet, and it will give us the flexibility to increase returns to shareholders as well as fund new growth opportunities. So we will certainly provide a comprehensive framework for future capital allocation as part of the Capital Market Day that we announced earlier. Returns to shareholders are obviously important, and increased dividends and buybacks will definitely be part of this equation. As it relates to M&A, sorry, I didn't answer on M&A. It's also part of what we will \u2011\u2011 it's, of course, part of the toolbox, and you'll get more details when we give you that more comprehensive framework again.\nOperator: Next, we go to the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.\nArun Jayaram: With the marginal supply source now moving from U.S. shale to OPEC, I wanted to see if you could frame what kind of changes in spending patterns that you\u2019re seeing from the NOCs versus \u2011\u2011 call it, maintenance work versus FIDs and things to increase productive capacity?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think what we have seen and we are already witnessing today, I think \u2011\u2011 and it's visible in Middle East, but beyond is the short cycle \u2011\u2011 the return of short-cycle activity to assure, as you said, the maintenance of production and with a small but visible increment of output supply. What we are seeing is also a commitment and some FID in the pipeline to increase oil capacity, sustain oil capacity for \u2011\u2011 with a few countries committing to participate fully and are laying out the foundation this year and next year into expanding the supply. But what we should not forget about \u2011\u2011 and is part true for Middle East \u2011\u2011 is there's also a gas market that is being very sustained, that has seen reinvestments. And it's part of the regional dynamic and that is already seeing \u2011\u2011 is continuing to see double-digit growth. So I think it's a combination of gas market being sustained and having had less setback than oil in the recent time. Short-cycle expansion and long-cycle acceleration with new FID capacity, and this is true from deepwater Brazil to the future investment in \u2011\u2011 and the current and future investment in Middle East or FIDs that are in the pipeline in Russia. So that's, again, very broad and that combined short and long cycle. And if you were to project, I think 2022 is a supply-led activity rebound and 2023 will be a demand-led activity growth. And the capacity expansion, the long cycle will further further contribute going forward well into 2023.\nArun Jayaram: Great. And my follow-up is, your outlook on 2022 embeds 200 basis points of year-over-year margin expansions in the fourth quarter. So that would \u2011\u2011 if I did my math right \u2011\u2011 that would put your EBITDA margins, based on the outlook, slightly above 24%. And so I wanted you to a little bit \u2011\u2011 go ahead.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yes. As we exit \u2011\u2011 it's an exit rate. We made a comparison 200 bps or higher as we exit 2022 when compared to the second half or Q4 of 2021...\nArun Jayaram: Exactly. Okay, got it. It\u2019s exit rate. So as we think about 2023, your outlook is that you could reach or exceed a mid-cycle EBITDA margin of 25%?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Second half.\nArun Jayaram: Second half. Yes...\nOlivier Le Peuch: In the second half, we expect in the second half to reach or exceed indeed.\nArun Jayaram: Great. And I just wanted to comment on the drivers of that, would be just mix and just further pricing improvement?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think, again, as I commented in a previous question, I think operating leverage will continue to give us a fall-through as we continue to leverage the structure change we have done and digital operation in particular. The mix will be \u2011\u2011 with long cycle and offshore \u2011\u2011 will continue to be digital part of the technology adoption across the different basins will participate in the mix further. And finally, pricing will expand. So I think this is the combination that gives us more confidence that we reached this midcycle prior to previous anticipation.\nOperator: Our next question is from Scott Gruber with Citigroup.\nScott Gruber: So, clearly, your capital intensity is going to be down versus last cycle. But just given potential growth rates that we're seeing coupled with you and peers keeping a lid on CapEx, it appears that the market could be quite tight exiting this year. So, my question is, can you keep CapEx at a similar level to 2022 as a percent of sales into '23 and into '24, while still riding the multiyear growth cycle that we all hope unfolds?\nStephane Biguet: So look, Scott, indeed, our capital intensity has reduced quite a bit and quickly just because we high-graded our portfolio, we extracted more operational efficiencies and we had our capital stewardship program as well. But where we deploy assets only to the best-return countries and contracts. So now, for 2022, we are looking at spending total capital investment, including APS, between $1.9 and $2 billion. That's just a relatively small increase compared to 2021. As to the \u2011\u2011 can we keep this into the future? It's a bit too soon to say. But we definitely, whatever increment we make, it's geared towards technology. It will be on the most accretive contracts. We want that incremental technology investment to be priced appropriately. And for that matter, we already have a strong pipeline of contracts that allowed us to do that at favorable commercial conditions. So we'll see how the year progresses. But for the moment, we are quite confident that the envelope we gave you allows us to fully seize the growth in 2022 and prepare for 2023. We will see how we set the envelope in 2023. It cannot be a huge increase for sure.\nOlivier Le Peuch: But we'll keep the capital intensity of our business going forward in check. I think the capital stewardship part of our returns-focused strategy is clearly giving us a little bit of a new dynamic and a new mindset in our commercial and contractual engagement with customers. And we have the whole organization focused on effectively and efficiently using the CapEx \u2011\u2011 the equipment pool that we have to deploy to the most accretive contracts and the most accretive engagements we have. So we'll continue to use this discipline to make sure that we keep in check broadly the capital intensity in this cycle.\nScott Gruber: Got it. And then, of the $1.9 billion to $2 billion budget this year, are you able to state how much is APS? And if you do end up selling the Canadian project this year, how much could the APS portion step down on an annualized basis?\nStephane Biguet: So, look, we don't disclose the split of the guidance. There is a small increase in APS investment, but it's matched with increased cash flow. As you know, the way we look at APS investment is really based on the cash flow of the individual projects. And as an aside, we are generating very good cash flow within our APS projects. So overall, as Olivier mentioned, the business of APS, because it's just a handful of projects, is going to be pretty flat this year. And the investment level is definitely not going to increase in future years.\nOperator: Our next question is from Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley.\nConnor Lynagh: Yes. Thanks. I was wondering if we could go back to pricing for a minute here. And I'm curious if you could maybe characterize, it certainly sounds like pricing has become more broad-based, but are there specific areas globally or specific divisions in which you're realizing more pricing. And I guess the question is, when do we see this in the results? I mean, is this broad-based, and you're going to be seeing it in 2022, or is this sort of early signs and it's more of a 2023 dynamic?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think it's broad-based. But let me maybe underline what, where, and how we see pricing conditions getting developed, I think, and we see it in three ways. First, we believe that pricing conditions and commercial terms are linked to performance. So performance and execution, our performance contracts are differentiated and the impact we provide to customers gives us the opportunity to negotiate favorable commercial terms and keep or expand our market position with key customers. So I think this has started and this is, depending on the region, something that impacts our service divisions, I would say: our Reservoir Performance and Well Construction particularly. The second one is linked to, I think, capacity \u2011\u2011 and I think capacity on unique technology, capacity on equipment that is tight, be it for offshore deployments or be it for high-volume intensity basins like North America. So this we have seen when the conditions are set, and we are getting an opportunity to expand from in green shoots to broad pricing improvement conditions. So this we have seen happening for the last year in North America, and we see this starting to happen in offshore deployment where unique equipment have to be mobilized, have to be secured, and they are done at pricing conditions that have improved over the last few months. Finally, inflation. Inflation is something that exists. It's related to market conditions. Inflation is something that we always deal with. And today, we are seeing more into the OECD and North America, but we are dealing with inflation every day in every geounit, as we call it, over the years, and we know how to manage it to engage with customers. It's more acute and it's more pronounced [in some parts of some basins], and we're responding to it with engagement of our customers and using the contract terms we have to offset the inflation pressures we are getting. So it's all about performance, including our technology. It's all about capacity tightening and it's about responding to the inflation pressure. So these three things are the lever we are using and that are starting to be more broad each of them across the different basins. Hence, it's progressive, and it's touching and addressing different basins and all divisions throughout 2022 and further into '23.\nConnor Lynagh: That's all helpful context. The inflation topic, obviously, is one we haven't really talked about extensively. It hasn't seemed to prevent you guys from expanding margins significantly. But, as we look into 2022, I'd say the market expectation seems to be that commodity deflation could occur, but labor inflation could increase. I'm curious what you're seeing on that front? And should we think about either of those having a meaningful impact on your margins, either positively or negatively?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think first, as you mentioned, inflation is nothing new and had happened last year. And I think the performance of our supply organization, the way we are dealing with it, I think, has helped us to mitigate and shift to the right, if I may, some of these. And secondly, I think we have been able to engage commercially to offset and create net pricing condition. So I think we see this happening forward. And when it comes to resource versus equipment, I think resource is always a hot topic in our organization. But I think we'll respond to this by further improving and accelerating our digital operation adoption so that we offset some of the pressure on our resources as much as we can and can offset this pressure as well. So I think it's part of a toolbox that we use and that we'll continue to tune as the cycle unfolds.\nOperator: Our next question is from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.\nRoger Read: Certainly good to see things turning around here. I just had a couple of questions to follow up on some of the discussions about expectations on EBITDA, margins, the mix that you expect to see. And I was curious what you would anticipate or what is embedded in the forecast in terms of a recovery in E&A spending within the overall spending increase, and if that's going to be less. And the reason I say that as we know several companies have essentially eliminated their E&A departments. How that might affect the EBITDA expansion that you anticipate '22 and on into '23?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think it's a valid question. But I think if you were to notice some of the highlights that we have released in the fourth quarter, we had a rebound of E&A data exploration sales as part of the \u2011\u2011 so the E&A is albeit very compressed compared to the peak of the last cycle. I think it's seeing a resurgence for two reasons. First, customers are trying to assess and reassess their reserves near around their hubs, be it on the land that they own, or be it on the key offshore hubs that they have developed to make sure they can fast track infill drilling and develop near-field exploration. So we see a lot of infrastructure-led exploration, not necessarily large greenfield, new, and we don't expect this to be the trend going forward. But we see that exploration is much more surgical exploration, if I may use that word, to be near-field backyard exploration, as we call it, around near infrastructure so that the operator particularly offshore gets to accelerate the return on the existing infrastructure and get fast track, fast short-cycle return on existing offshore. So we see that in Latin America, we see that in Gulf of Mexico and Europe, in West Africa, this is very broad. So we are benefiting from it, in our Reservoir Performance, we're benefiting from it in some of the key technology that we provide, including in digital. So I think, while it has been a step down compared to previous cycles, there is a keen interest and investment resurgence in E&A for this reason. And I think we'll see that as a backup of FID and it's true particularly offshore.\nRoger Read: I appreciate that. And then just looking at the Digital & Integration segment, it's obviously one a lot of us are focused on, and I know you've got a lot of expectations embedded in it as well. I was just curious, if you look back over the last 12 months and forward over the next 12, kind of what's been a positive surprise? What's been maybe a little bit of a headwind there? And if there's been a headwind, maybe how you would anticipate that reversing as we look into '22 and '23, probably more from the customer side, but if there's anything internal as well?\nOlivier Le Peuch: No, internal, I think we are very pleased with the progress of the deploying and continuing to build the digital foundation and digital platform foundation that support our strategy. Now, every customer has their own pace of adoption, their own intel in digital infrastructure they choose to deploy in which we need to plug. So our choice two years ago to go with an open data ecosystem foundation, the choice we have made to go in partnership with different cloud providers, different industry partners to expand our market reach has unlocked some of these customers to come and join us in our digital journey with our platform. So we continue to work on it. The last two years could have been a better and larger adoption, possibly. But I think we have the foundation in place. We are in the early innings, as I said, of full adoption, considering the size, the oversized scale of our customer base. So I remain confident that this is just the first step, and this will only accelerate. So we have the right foundation \u2011\u2011 digital is here to stay. Digital transformation is here to accelerate across the industry. And I think we are taking it one customer at a time, and this is what is happening. So we are positive.\nOperator: Our next question is from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta: The first question is a modeling specific one. Working capital, obviously, a big positive item this quarter. Can you talk about \u2011\u2011 do you see it unwinding over the course of the year? And any thoughts on trajectory there? And as it relates to that, Liberty, it looks like you sold $109 million of shares in the quarter. As it relates to that, should we think of that as a ratable exit? And is this run rate in the open market, or are you going to be opportunistic around share price?\nStephane Biguet: Thank you, Neil. So working capital, indeed, was significantly lower in the second half, especially in Q4. And again, this was a very strong customer collections and customer advances. So looking at 2022, we expect the same pattern, very seasonality in working capital. Usually, it increases in the first quarter. We have payments of annual incentives to employees, and then gradually, it improves in the subsequent quarters, mostly on cash collection. So we'll see the same in 2022, where we'll likely be at higher levels in general working capital consumption as activity accelerates, particularly considering the exit rates we are looking at, but we'll strive to maintain this to a minimum. And in any case, we still want to generate double-digit free cash flow margins, and that's inclusive of any working capital movement, so that helps us managing with this boundary. As to Liberty, yes, we are quite happy with our equity stake, has actually improved quite a bit since the transaction was announced. We did decide to monetize part of it \u2011\u2011 to start monetizing part of the investment, following the expiration of the lockup period. We still hold a significant share of the equity, as I highlighted: about 31% after the transaction. So we'll continue to monitor the value of the investment going forward, and we'll decide on further monetization based on market conditions.\nNeil Mehta: The follow-up is you announced a Capital Markets Day on this call earlier in the call sometime in the second half. Can you just talk about what you want to achieve out of that day from a financial perspective? What type of framework?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think we are willing to reengage with all of you in the live session, first and foremost. We want to lay out clearly our strategic framework going forward in the cycle and beyond, including our three engines of growth, core, digital and new energy, and we will support it by laying out our financial framework for return \u2011\u2011 including capital allocation and return to shareholders. That's what we aim at doing at that time. And we'll be clearly expressing in that setting the long-term target that we set. I believe we have time for one last question, operator?\nOperator: That last question is from Keith MacKey with RBC Capital Markets.\nKeith MacKey: Yes, I just wanted to maybe break \u2011\u2011 ask you to dig into your North American outlook for the 20% increase in spending this year. Can you maybe just sort of break that out in terms of what you might expect for drilling versus completion versus price inflation in general?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yes. Good question. I think, first, I think the North America outlook we are providing is inclusive of offshore and onshore, and onshore inclusive of U.S. and Canada. So I think it's a mix that is a bit not difficult, but it's a lot of variables at play to decipher here. But to your specific question, we foresee indeed that the U.S. land, which is a big portion of this activity outlook, will be having a bias towards Well Construction as the market is rotating from depleting the DUCs to replenishing the DUCs. Hence, Well Construction rig-based activity will be the lead in a 20% plus. And I think we are set to respond to this with a Well Construction portfolio in that environment, and this will be very favorable to us. And the offshore environment is broad. And I think offshore environment will be execution of Well Construction and also Reservoir Performance. And so, when you put all these and you put a more modest and more moderate Canada environment, you have a mix that is favorable to our Well Construction and production system in U.S. lands and favorable to our Reservoir Performance and Well Construction in offshore environments, all of which combine to give us this ambition about 20%.\nKeith MacKey: Perfect. And maybe one quick follow-up. Just on the Canadian APS, I know there was a sales process outstanding. Just curious if you can give any update on your thinking there currently.\nStephane Biguet: So we have received several offers for APS asset in Canada as part of the process we launched last year. So while we were assessing those proposals, the market conditions actually continued to improve and the value of the asset increased as a result. So we actually took the decision that the offers we had received were no longer reflective of the economic value and the cash flow potential of the asset. So we are not entertaining those offers at the moment. The asset is now generating very strong cash flows, but we remain open to all options.\nOlivier Le Peuch: So I believe we need to close the call. So before we close the call, I would like to leave you with a few takeaways. Firstly, the quality of our results during the fourth quarter, particularly the cash flow generation and our digital sales, have helped us close a remarkable year with financial outperformance during 2021, supporting significant EBITDA margin expansion and very sizeable reduction of our net debt. Credit to the entire Schlumberger team for outstanding execution across all basins and divisions. Secondly, our performance strategy execution has resulted in significant progress in the adoption of our digital platform, the deployment of our fit-for-basin and Transition Technologies, and the successful acceleration of our new energy ventures, each developing towards a sizeable addressable market. Thirdly, during 2021, we had enhanced our market positions with key customers, ahead of the significant upcycle, and we will fully benefit from the scale and breadth of the favorable activity mix unfolding across all basins during \u201822 and beyond. This will result in significant growth and further margin expansion and will support our double-digit free cash flow ambition. Finally, the macro environment is increasingly supportive of a potential supercycle. As these favorable market conditions extend both onshore and offshore, well beyond 2022, we have increased confidence in reaching our midcycle EBITDA margin ambition of 25% in the second half of 2023. Ladies and gentlemen, 2021 was a defining and transformative year for Schlumberger, and 2022 presents a unique environment to substantially build upon our success and accelerate our growth into the future. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T teleconference service. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Stephane Biguet",
            "content": "Thank you, Olivier and good morning ladies and gentlemen. Fourth quarter earnings per share excluding charges and credits was $0.41. This represents an increase of $0.05 compared to the third quarter of this year and of $0.19 when compared to the same period of last year. In addition, we recorded a net credit of $0.01, bringing GAAP EPS to $0.42. This consisted of a $0.02 gain relating to the sale of a portion of our shares in Liberty Oilfield Services, offset by a $0.01 loss relating to the early repayment of $1 billion of notes. Overall, our fourth quarter revenue of $6.2 billion increased 6% sequentially. All divisions posted sequential growth, led by Digital & Integration. From a geographical perspective, International revenue grew 5%, while North America grew 13%. Pretax operating margins improved 31 basis points sequentially to 15.8% and have increased for six quarters in a row. This sequential margin improvement was driven by very strong digital sales, which helped sustain overall margins, despite seasonality effects in the Northern Hemisphere. Company-wide [adjusted] EBITDA margin remained strong at 22.2%, which was essentially flat sequentially. Let me now go through the fourth quarter results for each division. Fourth-quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $889 million increased 10% sequentially with margins growing by 268 basis points to 37.7%. These increases were driven by significantly higher digital and exploration data licensing sales, which were partly offset by the effects of a pipeline disruption in Ecuador that impacted our APS projects. Reservoir Performance growth further accelerated in the fourth quarter with revenue increasing 8% sequentially to $1.3 billion. This growth was primarily due to higher intervention and stimulation activity in the international offshore markets. Margins were essentially flat at 15.5% as a result of seasonality effects and technology mix, largely driven by the end of summer exploration campaigns in the Northern Hemisphere. Well Construction revenue of $2.4 billion increased 5% sequentially due to higher land and offshore drilling, both in North America and internationally. Margins of 15.4% were essentially flat sequentially as the favorable combination of increased activity and pricing gains was offset by seasonal effects. Finally, Production Systems revenue of $1.8 billion was up 5% sequentially, largely from new offshore projects and year-end sales. However, margins decreased 85 basis points to 9.0%, largely as a result of the impact of delayed deliveries due to global supply and logistic constraints. Now turning to our liquidity. Our cash flow generation during the fourth quarter was outstanding. We delivered $1.9 billion of cash flow from operations and free cash flow of $1.3 billion during the quarter. This was the result of a very strong working capital performance driven by exceptional cash collections and customer advances. Cash flows were further enhanced by the sale of a portion of our shares in Liberty, generating net proceeds of $109 million during the quarter. Following this transaction, we hold a 31% interest in Liberty. On a full-year basis, we generated $4.7 billion of cash flow from operations and $3 billion of free cash flow. We generated more free cash in 2021 than in 2019, despite our revenue being 30% lower. This is largely attributable to our efforts of the last two years relating to the implementation of our capital stewardship program and the high grading of our portfolio. As a result of all of this, we ended the year with net debt of $11.1 billion. This represents an improvement of $2.8 billion compared to the end of 2020. We are proud to say that net debt is now at its lowest level of the last five years. During the [quarter] (corrected by company after the call), we also continued to reduce gross debt by repaying $1 billion dollars of notes that were coming due in May of this year. In total, our gross debt reduced by $2.7 billion in the last 12 months thereby significantly increasing our financial flexibility. Now, looking ahead to 2022. We expect total capital investments, consisting of capex and investments in APS and exploration data, to be approximately $1.9 to $2 billion dollars, as compared to just under $1.7 billion in 2021. This increase will allow us to fully seize the multiyear growth opportunity ahead of us, while still achieving our double-digit free cash flow margin objective. We are entering this growth cycle with a business that is much less capital-intensive as compared to previous cycles. As a reminder, during the last growth cycle of 2009 to 2014, our total capital investment as a percentage of revenue was approximately 12%. We are, therefore, well-positioned to fully reap the benefits of this growth cycle with the potential for enhanced free cash flow margins and return on capital employed. With this backdrop, I would like to emphasize that based on the industry fundamentals and positioning of the Company that Olivier highlighted earlier, our financial outlook for 2022 is very strong. We have high expectations and, in 2022, we expect a \u201ctriple double\u201d consisting of double-digit return on capital employed; double-digit return on sales; and double-digit free cash flow margin. It is worth noting that we have not experienced this combination in a single year since 2015. Finally, I am pleased to announce that we will hold a Capital Markets Day in the second half of the year. This event will allow us the opportunity to provide you with additional details relating to Schlumberger's strategy and financial objectives. Further information regarding this event will be forthcoming shortly. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier. Chase, it's Stephane. Look, I like your expression on free cash flow. It was indeed quite strong last year with $3 billion. Now indeed, we visibly accelerated the deleveraging of our balance sheet \u2010\u2010 but we are not quite there yet at the leverage ratio we committed to. So we have a clear line of sight now to achieving the target leverage we announced earlier, even though there's still some uncertainty remaining at the start of the year. Nevertheless, with the market fundamentals consolidating, particularly in the second half of the year and into 2023, we have even more confidence indeed now in generating significant excess cash this year and beyond. So we will be able to maintain quite a healthy balance sheet, and it will give us the flexibility to increase returns to shareholders as well as fund new growth opportunities. So we will certainly provide a comprehensive framework for future capital allocation as part of the Capital Market Day that we announced earlier. Returns to shareholders are obviously important, and increased dividends and buybacks will definitely be part of this equation. As it relates to M&A, sorry, I didn't answer on M&A. It's also part of what we will \u2010\u2010 it's, of course, part of the toolbox, and you'll get more details when we give you that more comprehensive framework again. So look, Scott, indeed, our capital intensity has reduced quite a bit and quickly just because we high-graded our portfolio, we extracted more operational efficiencies and we had our capital stewardship program as well. But where we deploy assets only to the best-return countries and contracts. So now, for 2022, we are looking at spending total capital investment, including APS, between $1.9 and $2 billion. That's just a relatively small increase compared to 2021. As to the \u2010\u2010 can we keep this into the future? It's a bit too soon to say. But we definitely, whatever increment we make, it's geared towards technology. It will be on the most accretive contracts. We want that incremental technology investment to be priced appropriately. And for that matter, we already have a strong pipeline of contracts that allowed us to do that at favorable commercial conditions. So we'll see how the year progresses. But for the moment, we are quite confident that the envelope we gave you allows us to fully seize the growth in 2022 and prepare for 2023. We will see how we set the envelope in 2023. It cannot be a huge increase for sure. So, look, we don't disclose the split of the guidance. There is a small increase in APS investment, but it's matched with increased cash flow. As you know, the way we look at APS investment is really based on the cash flow of the individual projects. And as an aside, we are generating very good cash flow within our APS projects. So overall, as Olivier mentioned, the business of APS, because it's just a handful of projects, is going to be pretty flat this year. And the investment level is definitely not going to increase in future years. Thank you, Neil. So working capital, indeed, was significantly lower in the second half, especially in Q4. And again, this was a very strong customer collections and customer advances. So looking at 2022, we expect the same pattern, very seasonality in working capital. Usually, it increases in the first quarter. We have payments of annual incentives to employees, and then gradually, it improves in the subsequent quarters, mostly on cash collection. So we'll see the same in 2022, where we'll likely be at higher levels in general working capital consumption as activity accelerates, particularly considering the exit rates we are looking at, but we'll strive to maintain this to a minimum. And in any case, we still want to generate double-digit free cash flow margins, and that's inclusive of any working capital movement, so that helps us managing with this boundary. As to Liberty, yes, we are quite happy with our equity stake, has actually improved quite a bit since the transaction was announced. We did decide to monetize part of it \u2010\u2010 to start monetizing part of the investment, following the expiration of the lockup period. We still hold a significant share of the equity, as I highlighted: about 31% after the transaction. So we'll continue to monitor the value of the investment going forward, and we'll decide on further monetization based on market conditions. So we have received several offers for APS asset in Canada as part of the process we launched last year. So while we were assessing those proposals, the market conditions actually continued to improve and the value of the asset increased as a result. So we actually took the decision that the offers we had received were no longer reflective of the economic value and the cash flow potential of the asset. So we are not entertaining those offers at the moment. The asset is now generating very strong cash flows, but we remain open to all options."

            "name": "Olivier Le Peuch",
            "content": "Thank you, ND. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on the call today. In my prepared remarks, I will cover our Q4 results and full-year 2021 achievements. Thereafter, I will follow with our view of the 2022 outlook and some insights into our near-term financial ambitions. Stephane will then give more detail on our financial results and we will open for your questions. The fourth quarter was characterized by broad-based activity growth. With continued momentum in North America, activity acceleration in the international markets, and an accretive offshore market contribution \u2010\u2010 upon which we delivered strong sequential revenue growth, our sixth consecutive quarter of margin expansion, and outstanding double-digit free cash flow generation. These financial results conclude an exceptional year of financial outperformance for Schlumberger, at a pivotal time for the Company and in our industry at large. Underlying these results are the following highlights from the quarter: Geographically, sequential growth in North America exceeded rig activity, growing in excess of 20% offshore, and international revenue growth accelerated, closing the second half of 2021, up 12% versus the prior year. All international areas posted growth, driven by gains in more than 75% of our international business units. By division, revenue in all four divisions grew sequentially, and when compared to the same period last year. Digital & Integration led growth, posting double-digit sequential growth and record-high margins. Well Construction and Reservoir Performance, our predominantly service-oriented divisions, outperformed expectations with strong sequential growth and approximately 30% growth year-over-year on a pro-forma basis. Production Systems recorded year-end sales, which drove mid-single digit growth, though partially impacted by logistics challenges. Operating margins expanded in spite of seasonality effects, improving further beyond prepandemic levels. And finally, we generated outstanding cash flow from operations \u2010\u2010 exceeding $1.9 billion in the quarter. All in all, I am very pleased with our operational execution, our safety performance, and our financial results through the fourth quarter. Now let me briefly reflect on what we achieved in 2021. In our core, we fully operationalized our returns-focused strategy, leveraging our new division and basin organization to seize the start of the upcycle. In North America, this resulted in full-year topline revenue growth, excluding the effects of divestures, and significantly expanded margins \u2010\u2010 achieving double digits, one of the financial targets we laid out in 2019. Internationally, we also grew the top-line and expanded margins significantly, as international activity strengthened in the second half of the year. This also resulted in full-year international margins that exceeded 2019 levels. Taken together, these margins resulted in the highest global operating margins of the last six years, setting an excellent foundation for further expansion, as activity accelerates and market conditions further support pricing improvement. In Digital, our second engine of growth, I am very proud of the momentum we established during the year. We advanced on our goals to expand market access and accelerate adoption of our platform, AI capabilities, and powerful digital tools to reduce cycle time, improve performance, and lower carbon intensity. We built partnerships to achieve comprehensive cloud access globally, collaborated with AI innovators to deploy machine-learning and AI solutions, and enabled digital operations through the automation of key workflows in well construction and production operations. At the end of 2021, we have more than 240 commercial DELFI customers, recorded more than 160% DELFI user growth year over year, and saw a more than tenfold increase in compute-cycle intensity on our DELFI cloud platform. We also made significant progress in our data business streams and digital operations \u2010\u2010 advancing our OSDU commercial offerings, autonomous drilling, and the adoption of Agora Edge AI and IOT solutions with great success. The Q4 results, including significant uptake in digital sales and sizeable incremental margins, are a clear testament of this success. In Schlumberger New Energy, we continued to advance the development of clean energy technologies and low-carbon projects. In 2021, we took a position in stationary energy storage, expanding our total addressable market, and advanced all of our ventures in hydrogen, lithium, geoenergy, and a suite of CCUS opportunities, including our bioenergy CCS project. Some notable milestones achieved include the signature of pilot agreements with Genvia, our hydrogen venture, with ArcelorMittal, Ugitech, Vicat, and Hynamics \u2010\u2010 leading companies in steel and cement. And in Celsius, our geoenergy venture, we secured five commercial contracts in Europe and one in North America for a prestigious university campus. This was also a pivotal year for us in terms of our commitment to sustainability. We announced our comprehensive 2050 net-zero commitment, inclusive of Scope 3 emissions, and launched the Transition Technologies portfolio to focus on the decarbonization of oil and gas operations with much success. In addition, Schlumberger earned an AA rating by MSCI, and won an ESG Top Performer Award by Hart Energy, recognizing our sustainability efforts, our enhanced disclosures, and our commitment to apply our technologies and capabilities towards helping the world meet future energy demand. In summary, 2021 was a great year for Schlumberger. Beyond these operational and financial results and our ESG accomplishments, we made excellent progress in our core, digital, and new energy: the three engines of growth that support our success now and well into the future. Above all, I am most proud of our people \u2010\u2010 their unique ability to execute, remobilizing operations across the world through numerous pandemic constraints, adapting to logistics and supply-chain dynamics, and setting new performance benchmarks \u2010\u2010 all of which earned the recognition of our customers. I would like to thank the entire team for delivering a year of outperformance on every metric. They surpassed all of our targets this year and created excellent momentum as we enter 2022, for which I would like now to share our outlook. Looking ahead, we have increased confidence in our view of robust multiyear market growth. Tight oil supply and demand growth beyond the prepandemic peak, are projected to result in a substantial step up in capital spending \u2010\u2010 amid shrinking spare capacity, declining inventory balances, and supportive oil prices. In addition, we expect more pervasive service pricing improvements in response to market conditions as technology adoption increases while service capacity tightens. In essence, 2022 will be a period of stronger short-cycle activity resurgence, driven by improved visibility in the demand recovery and greater confidence in the oil price environment. And as oil demand exceeds prepandemic levels in 2023 and beyond, long-cycle development will augment capital spending growth in response to the current supply. This demand-led capital spending growth sets the foundation for a strong multiyear upcycle. Indeed, this scenario is already being established, as the number of FIDs increases, service pricing has begun to improve, and multiyear long-cycle capacity expansion plans have started \u2010\u2010 particularly internationally and offshore \u2010\u2010 as seen during the last quarter. Turning to 2022, more specifically, we expect an increase in capital spending of at least 20% in North America, impacting both the onshore and offshore markets, while internationally, capital spending is projected to increase in the low-to-mid teens, building momentum from a very strong exit in the second half of 2021. All areas and operating environments \u2010\u2010 short- and long-cycle, including deepwater \u2010\u2010 are expected to post strong growth, with upside potential as Omicron disruptions dissipate as the year advances. In this scenario, increased activity and pricing will drive simultaneous double-digit growth \u2010\u2010 both internationally and in North America \u2010\u2010 that will lead our overall 2022 revenue growth to reach mid-teens. Our ambition is to, once again, expand operating and EBITDA margins on a full-year basis, exiting the year with EBITDA margins at least 200 bps higher than the fourth quarter of 2021. In this context, let me share how we see the year unfolding. Directionally, while we are still experiencing COVID-related disruptions, we anticipate typical seasonality in the first quarter, with revenue and margin progression similar to historical sequential trends, which will be seen most prominently in Digital & Integration. This will be followed by a strong seasonal uptick in the second quarter across all divisions with growth further strengthening through the second half of the year \u2010\u2010 supporting our full-year, mid-teens revenue growth ambition and EBITDA margin expansion. This growth and margin expansion trajectory gives us further confidence that we will reach or exceed our mid-cycle ambition of 25% adjusted EBITDA margin before the end of 2023, leading to adjusted EBITDA that should visibly exceed 2019 levels in dollar terms. With this, I will now turn the call over to Stephane. Thank you, Stephane. So I believe that we are ready to turn the call to you for the questions. Thank you. Thank you, James. Let me explain why we have increased confidence. And I think some part of the answer on this question is in the quality of the results we have delivered in 2021 as a foundation. And next, I believe that the current market conditions are clearly supporting our thesis for double-digit CAGR growth over a few years. So with this backdrop, I think we have, we believe, three or four factors that will help us continue to guide upwards our margin expansion. Firstly, we set a foundation. The foundation we have put in place in the last 18 months, the operating leverage reset, the integration performance execution, and the portfolio high-grading are here to stay. And this was already very visibly impacting the service-oriented divisions of Well Construction and Reservoir Performance, as you have seen throughout the year and particularly the second half of last year. And we saw we obviously have this surpassed already with the 2018 margin performance. Secondly, I think the market mix is set to improve and resonate to our profit of strength. An increased offshore activity mix has already started to happen, and we expect this to only accelerate as the year unfolds and further into 2022. The adoption of technology also is accelerating, as you have seen, including digital, but our fit-for-basin, our Transition Technologies and all the technologies that extract performance for our operations are making an impact today, and are getting further adoption by a customer and giving us a premium. And finally, pricing. Where a year ago, we were talking about green shoot pricing in North America, today we are seeing and we are already recording some of pricing improvements in a broad market condition, both in North America and also internationally, when we are getting awarded new contracts as well as when we have to mobilize and deliver unique technology to our customer. So, as the year develops, we believe that these attributes \u2010\u2010 our foundation, operating leverage, our performance that differentiate our execution give us a premium. Our market mix, our technology adoption, success with customers and finally pricing, giving a tailwind to this will drive and further expand our margin to the 2025 \u2010\u2010 the 25% margin expansion. So it's not about if, but it's about when. And we have gained confidence and we have moved forward our confidence in this into the 2022. Maybe in one word, the market will be \u2010\u2010 growth will be very broad across all geographies, across all divisions. First, as a backdrop, I think that's what we are realizing and that's quite unique. But I think you have to characterize it first geographically or very high level. I think it's possibly a tale of two halves, with North America leading the uptick of growth. Activity growth in the first half; international further accelerating in the second half. While we did end on the H2 \u2010\u2010 over H2 of 12%. We expect this to be the base in the first half and accelerate further in the second half internationally, so that we are even accelerating into 2023 for international activity. Secondly, I believe that if we have to characterize what will lead and be accretive to growth. I would say America's land, because of activity uptick, but I will also put offshore environment and Middle East. These are the three engines of growth that will pull this year's growth to the target ambition we have put up mid-teens. So now, per division, I think the service-oriented divisions of Reservoir Performance and Well Construction will be accretive to this we expect, followed by \u2010\u2010 because they are benefiting from this social environment, they're benefiting from the pricing, and they have strong both NAM and international presence. So they're benefiting from long-cycle exposure and technology mix favorable. In addition, Production Systems will also see growth, building on the short-cycle exposure to North America and the backlog of contracts that we have won in the last few quarters that will execute towards 2022. Finally on Digital & Integration, it's a two-phase of a division here. We expect the digital to be accretive to our growth, while it will be visibly moderated by a flattish environment for APS production, going forward. So that gives you the mix across the divisions and across the geographies. Yes. I think, Dave, it's part of the mix of execution that we have. And I think we always mobilize for new projects somewhere in the world. And we are committing to international growth and margin expansion this year. The last quarter was already having a witness of significant new project starts, yet we have marginally improved our margins last quarter, and we have seen the results of the core division. So we did it already. So I think as we accelerate deployments, yes, we are very critically assessing the cost of this start-up. We are working for customers to minimize. We are using our digital operations to remote and optimize our deployment of resources. And we believe that what we have done in the last quarter, we'll continue to do in 2022. So I think directionally, we are still set to improve our margin internationally in 2022, despite \u2010\u2010 and building on this new project \u2010\u2010 so we are very keen to start off this new project. We are very proud of the different contract awards that we won last year. And I think this is part of the mix that we're executing. And the more we \u2010\u2010 the more activity and the more growth \u2010\u2010 we will respond and continue to use efficiency and leverage our operating practice to minimize impact and engage with customers to get full recognition of our investment. Yes. Let me give you a little bit of color into this. So first, I think if I have to characterize the uptick we've seen in digital sales at the end of the year is not a pure year-end sales effect on one or two large contracts and one or two applications and software sales. It's broad. It's very diverse. It's touch and expand upon the platform strategy that developed different revenue streams. So it's about new DELFI-cloud customers, and you have seen we have announced our progress one more time in last quarter. It's about new revenue monetization in digital operations, including Agora, including drilling, remote operations, and automation. It's about new data business streams where we have been securing contracts for OSDU foundation, where we are the first to commercialize enterprise data management solutions on this OSDU. And it's the follow-through on the enterprise contract that we have won in 2021 or in 2020 on DELFI adoption. So it's significant. It relates to the progress we have made in our platform. It relates to the acceleration of digital adoption by our customer and digital \u2010\u2010 this pursuit of digital transformation by customers. And it translates into an uptick in each and every one of the digital revenue streams we have created and the success from data to workflow and to operations. So it's diverse, it's broad, and it's multifaceted. So it's here to continue to expand. So I'm positive on this because it's not a one-off. Obviously, there is a year-end sales effect there that we're not \u2010\u2010 that would not repeat in the first quarter. But at the same time, something that I see expanding as a platform going forward. And we are in the early innings of this adoption. As we mentioned a quarter ago, we have 1,700 digital customers. And we are in the early innings of deploying and pursuing this large installed base with digital transformation. So it was the first cycle of this digital expansion and digital adoption. Actually, this would continue in 2022 and accelerate beyond. Great question. I think the fundamentals, as we see them, have not changed. And actually, some characteristics of the cycle have accelerated \u2010\u2010 have been accentuated in recent months. So the attribute that we put first is the outlook of economic GDP growth that considering the oil intensity and energy intensity will fill and will drive the oil demand as a key attribute beyond the previous peak, no later than at the end of this year, according to the latest projection, and is set to expand visibly beyond not only in 2023, but a few years beyond this. So the first is the macro demand situation is set to be favorable for the next few years. Secondly, I think the supply-demand imbalance and the supply, I would almost call it tardiness that we are facing is pointing not only to an uplift in the commodity price, but also is pointing to investment \u2010\u2010 return to investment across the broad portfolio of our customers. So you have seen it in North America, no surprise. North America is still and will remain structurally smaller than previous cycles due to the capital discipline, but also due to the crunch of supply, including on the services side. Secondly, I think the international underinvestment for the last few years \u2010\u2010 actually, the last down cycle \u2010\u2010 combined with the dip in the last two years is creating conditions for a necessary injection of short-cycle capital and then long cycle capital investment to respond to the supply. So we are seeing growth in North America, albeit a cut, we are seeing a rebound \u2010\u2010 a visible rebound in short and long cycle investments internationally. And I will insist on the long cycle because I believe that both oil capacity is being looked upon by some OPEC members to secure future supply market share, but also the international and majors are investing into their advantage offshore basins and we are seeing not only infill drilling, but we are seeing FID for offshore that are accelerating going forward. So it's a mix of offshore rebound, solid including deepwater, international short cycle, and oil capacity in land, and finally, solid growth in North America. So these are unique conditions that are tightening the capacity and that are creating the underlying pricing improvement conditions. I think what we have seen and we are already witnessing today, I think \u2010\u2010 and it's visible in Middle East, but beyond is the short cycle \u2010\u2010 the return of short-cycle activity to assure, as you said, the maintenance of production and with a small but visible increment of output supply. What we are seeing is also a commitment and some FID in the pipeline to increase oil capacity, sustain oil capacity for \u2010\u2010 with a few countries committing to participate fully and are laying out the foundation this year and next year into expanding the supply. But what we should not forget about \u2010\u2010 and is part true for Middle East \u2010\u2010 is there's also a gas market that is being very sustained, that has seen reinvestments. And it's part of the regional dynamic and that is already seeing \u2010\u2010 is continuing to see double-digit growth. So I think it's a combination of gas market being sustained and having had less setback than oil in the recent time. Short-cycle expansion and long-cycle acceleration with new FID capacity, and this is true from deepwater Brazil to the future investment in \u2010\u2010 and the current and future investment in Middle East or FIDs that are in the pipeline in Russia. So that's, again, very broad and that combined short and long cycle. And if you were to project, I think 2022 is a supply-led activity rebound and 2023 will be a demand-led activity growth. And the capacity expansion, the long cycle will further further contribute going forward well into 2023. Yes. As we exit \u2010\u2010 it's an exit rate. We made a comparison 200 bps or higher as we exit 2022 when compared to the second half or Q4 of 2021... Second half. In the second half, we expect in the second half to reach or exceed indeed. I think, again, as I commented in a previous question, I think operating leverage will continue to give us a fall-through as we continue to leverage the structure change we have done and digital operation in particular. The mix will be \u2010\u2010 with long cycle and offshore \u2010\u2010 will continue to be digital part of the technology adoption across the different basins will participate in the mix further. And finally, pricing will expand. So I think this is the combination that gives us more confidence that we reached this midcycle prior to previous anticipation. But we'll keep the capital intensity of our business going forward in check. I think the capital stewardship part of our returns-focused strategy is clearly giving us a little bit of a new dynamic and a new mindset in our commercial and contractual engagement with customers. And we have the whole organization focused on effectively and efficiently using the CapEx \u2010\u2010 the equipment pool that we have to deploy to the most accretive contracts and the most accretive engagements we have. So we'll continue to use this discipline to make sure that we keep in check broadly the capital intensity in this cycle. I think it's broad-based. But let me maybe underline what, where, and how we see pricing conditions getting developed, I think, and we see it in three ways. First, we believe that pricing conditions and commercial terms are linked to performance. So performance and execution, our performance contracts are differentiated and the impact we provide to customers gives us the opportunity to negotiate favorable commercial terms and keep or expand our market position with key customers. So I think this has started and this is, depending on the region, something that impacts our service divisions, I would say: our Reservoir Performance and Well Construction particularly. The second one is linked to, I think, capacity \u2010\u2010 and I think capacity on unique technology, capacity on equipment that is tight, be it for offshore deployments or be it for high-volume intensity basins like North America. So this we have seen when the conditions are set, and we are getting an opportunity to expand from in green shoots to broad pricing improvement conditions. So this we have seen happening for the last year in North America, and we see this starting to happen in offshore deployment where unique equipment have to be mobilized, have to be secured, and they are done at pricing conditions that have improved over the last few months. Finally, inflation. Inflation is something that exists. It's related to market conditions. Inflation is something that we always deal with. And today, we are seeing more into the OECD and North America, but we are dealing with inflation every day in every geounit, as we call it, over the years, and we know how to manage it to engage with customers. It's more acute and it's more pronounced [in some parts of some basins], and we're responding to it with engagement of our customers and using the contract terms we have to offset the inflation pressures we are getting. So it's all about performance, including our technology. It's all about capacity tightening and it's about responding to the inflation pressure. So these three things are the lever we are using and that are starting to be more broad each of them across the different basins. Hence, it's progressive, and it's touching and addressing different basins and all divisions throughout 2022 and further into '23. I think first, as you mentioned, inflation is nothing new and had happened last year. And I think the performance of our supply organization, the way we are dealing with it, I think, has helped us to mitigate and shift to the right, if I may, some of these. And secondly, I think we have been able to engage commercially to offset and create net pricing condition. So I think we see this happening forward. And when it comes to resource versus equipment, I think resource is always a hot topic in our organization. But I think we'll respond to this by further improving and accelerating our digital operation adoption so that we offset some of the pressure on our resources as much as we can and can offset this pressure as well. So I think it's part of a toolbox that we use and that we'll continue to tune as the cycle unfolds. I think it's a valid question. But I think if you were to notice some of the highlights that we have released in the fourth quarter, we had a rebound of E&A data exploration sales as part of the \u2010\u2010 so the E&A is albeit very compressed compared to the peak of the last cycle. I think it's seeing a resurgence for two reasons. First, customers are trying to assess and reassess their reserves near around their hubs, be it on the land that they own, or be it on the key offshore hubs that they have developed to make sure they can fast track infill drilling and develop near-field exploration. So we see a lot of infrastructure-led exploration, not necessarily large greenfield, new, and we don't expect this to be the trend going forward. But we see that exploration is much more surgical exploration, if I may use that word, to be near-field backyard exploration, as we call it, around near infrastructure so that the operator particularly offshore gets to accelerate the return on the existing infrastructure and get fast track, fast short-cycle return on existing offshore. So we see that in Latin America, we see that in Gulf of Mexico and Europe, in West Africa, this is very broad. So we are benefiting from it, in our Reservoir Performance, we're benefiting from it in some of the key technology that we provide, including in digital. So I think, while it has been a step down compared to previous cycles, there is a keen interest and investment resurgence in E&A for this reason. And I think we'll see that as a backup of FID and it's true particularly offshore. No, internal, I think we are very pleased with the progress of the deploying and continuing to build the digital foundation and digital platform foundation that support our strategy. Now, every customer has their own pace of adoption, their own intel in digital infrastructure they choose to deploy in which we need to plug. So our choice two years ago to go with an open data ecosystem foundation, the choice we have made to go in partnership with different cloud providers, different industry partners to expand our market reach has unlocked some of these customers to come and join us in our digital journey with our platform. So we continue to work on it. The last two years could have been a better and larger adoption, possibly. But I think we have the foundation in place. We are in the early innings, as I said, of full adoption, considering the size, the oversized scale of our customer base. So I remain confident that this is just the first step, and this will only accelerate. So we have the right foundation \u2010\u2010 digital is here to stay. Digital transformation is here to accelerate across the industry. And I think we are taking it one customer at a time, and this is what is happening. So we are positive. I think we are willing to reengage with all of you in the live session, first and foremost. We want to lay out clearly our strategic framework going forward in the cycle and beyond, including our three engines of growth, core, digital and new energy, and we will support it by laying out our financial framework for return \u2010\u2010 including capital allocation and return to shareholders. That's what we aim at doing at that time. And we'll be clearly expressing in that setting the long-term target that we set. I believe we have time for one last question, operator? Yes. Good question. I think, first, I think the North America outlook we are providing is inclusive of offshore and onshore, and onshore inclusive of U.S. and Canada. So I think it's a mix that is a bit not difficult, but it's a lot of variables at play to decipher here. But to your specific question, we foresee indeed that the U.S. land, which is a big portion of this activity outlook, will be having a bias towards Well Construction as the market is rotating from depleting the DUCs to replenishing the DUCs. Hence, Well Construction rig-based activity will be the lead in a 20% plus. And I think we are set to respond to this with a Well Construction portfolio in that environment, and this will be very favorable to us. And the offshore environment is broad. And I think offshore environment will be execution of Well Construction and also Reservoir Performance. And so, when you put all these and you put a more modest and more moderate Canada environment, you have a mix that is favorable to our Well Construction and production system in U.S. lands and favorable to our Reservoir Performance and Well Construction in offshore environments, all of which combine to give us this ambition about 20%. So I believe we need to close the call. So before we close the call, I would like to leave you with a few takeaways. Firstly, the quality of our results during the fourth quarter, particularly the cash flow generation and our digital sales, have helped us close a remarkable year with financial outperformance during 2021, supporting significant EBITDA margin expansion and very sizeable reduction of our net debt. Credit to the entire Schlumberger team for outstanding execution across all basins and divisions. Secondly, our performance strategy execution has resulted in significant progress in the adoption of our digital platform, the deployment of our fit-for-basin and Transition Technologies, and the successful acceleration of our new energy ventures, each developing towards a sizeable addressable market. Thirdly, during 2021, we had enhanced our market positions with key customers, ahead of the significant upcycle, and we will fully benefit from the scale and breadth of the favorable activity mix unfolding across all basins during \u201822 and beyond. This will result in significant growth and further margin expansion and will support our double-digit free cash flow ambition. Finally, the macro environment is increasingly supportive of a potential supercycle. As these favorable market conditions extend both onshore and offshore, well beyond 2022, we have increased confidence in reaching our midcycle EBITDA margin ambition of 25% in the second half of 2023. Ladies and gentlemen, 2021 was a defining and transformative year for Schlumberger, and 2022 presents a unique environment to substantially build upon our success and accelerate our growth into the future. Thank you very much."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, ND Maduemezia. Please go ahead.\nND Maduemezia : Thank you, Lea. Good morning and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited, Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being hosted from the Schlumberger Doll Research Center in Boston, following the Schlumberger Board Meeting held earlier this week. Joining us on the call, are Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Executive Officer and Stephane Biguet, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind all participants that some of the statements we'll be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and our other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our third quarter press release, which is on our website. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch : Thank you, ND Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us on the call. In my prepared remarks today, I will cover 3 topics. Our third quarter results, our view of the near-term macro, and the exceptional growth opportunity ahead of us. I will then share some insights on the Middle East and offshore markets and finally a first view of the 2022 growth outlook. Stephane will then give more details on our financial results and we'll open the floor for questions. The third quarter results further emphasize our returns focus, consistent execution, and the advantaged mix of our portfolio. Growth momentum was sustained and we delivered a fifth consecutive quarter of margin expansion, achieving the highest pretax operating margin since 2015 and cash flow from operations in excess $1 billion. Let me share with you some performance highlights from the quarter across our core, digital, and new energy. In our core, first, margin expansion was led by Well Construction and Reservoir Performance where we fully seized the sequential growth opportunity driving operating margins in both these divisions above mid-teens, the highest levels in the last 3 years. Revenue quality improved, boosted by a favorable activity mix and higher new technology uptake that delivered strong margin expansion. Second, internationally, we recorded growth in all 3 areas with revenue up 11% year-on-year, consistent with our ambition of double-digit revenue growth compared to the second half of 2020. International margin further expanded, exceeding prepandemic levels and are at the highest since 2018. In North America, revenue growth was sustained, albeit impacted by transitory supply and logistics disruption. Margins also continued to expand with operating margins firmly at double digits. Finally, we are pleased with the very sizable activity pipeline secured during the quarter, through competitive tenders, direct awards, and contract extensions, some of which included net pricing improvement, building on our differentiated performance, integration capabilities, and technology. These wins enhance our market position, creating a long tail of activity and a platform to further new technology adoption and digital deployment, strengthening our leadership as we enter an exceptional growth cycle. We are delivering on the promise of our performance strategy, which is increasingly impacting our top- and bottom-line results, both in North America and internationally. As the cycle accelerates, we will leverage our advantaged platform to capture the exciting growth and outperform the market in our core going forward. Moving to Digital: we continued to progress our platform strategy this quarter, expanding our offering through the acquisition of Independent Data Services and a strategic investment in DeepIQ to further advance our digital technology offering and the adoption of AI solutions in our industry. In digital production operations, we announced a partnership with AVEVA to expand powerful edge and IoT solutions to the field, complementing our Agora* platform and Sensia solutions. And in digital drilling, we successfully completed the first fully automated section drilled offshore at the Hebron platform for ExxonMobil in Canada, as you have seen in this morning's earnings release. This achievement is a significant step for our industry, particularly offshore, and signals a momentous opportunity to apply digital technology to create a step change in well construction safety, performance, and carbon footprint. As shared recently, we are seeing the adoption of digital solutions accelerate in our industry. And whilst we are in the early innings, we are excited about the prospect of transitioning the majority of our software customer base of over 1,700 companies to our digital platform during the next few years. This growing adoption will generate an expanding set of digital revenue streams over a long horizon as we transition every customer to new digital solutions for the data, workflows, and operations. Moving to New Energy, we advanced our portfolio by taking a position stationary energy storage through our strategic investment in EnerVenue, a company with differentiated metal-hydrogen battery technology. This represents a new opportunity set and an expansion of total addressable market in a sector with significant growth opportunities. In geoenergy, following the success of the pilot in our technology facility in France, Celsius Energy has secured 5 commercial contracts in Europe. This is a significant achievement in the commercialization roadmap for Celsius as a low-carbon solution for heating and cooling buildings, contributing to global efforts in reducing emissions. To conclude on this quarter\u2019s performance, we once again demonstrated excellent progress in our strategic execution across our portfolio, supporting outstanding results. And I want to thank the entire Schlumberger team, not only for delivering another strong quarter, but for their unwavering efforts to create enduring value for our customers and our shareholders. Now I would like to turn to the near-term macro and growth opportunity ahead of us. The market fundamentals have improved steadily throughout 2021, especially over the last few weeks, with oil and gas prices attaining recent highs, inventories at their lowest levels in recent history, a rebound in demand and encouraging trends in the pandemic containment efforts. This strengthening in industry fundamentals, combined with the action of OPEC+ and continued capital discipline in North America have firmly established a prospect of an exceptional multiyear growth cycle ahead. In the international markets, all regions are set to benefit from this highly favorable environment, something not seen internationally since the last supercycle. This expansion will occur at different \u2013paces across different basins, operating environments, and customer groups resulting in a sustained multipronged growth cycle. Our broad exposure across these different dimensions put us in an advantaged position to fully seize this growth opportunity. For example, this growth inflection is already visibly underway in Latin America, sparked by the resumption of exploration and the initiation of long-cycle development campaigns. Activity has strengthened throughout 2021 and revenue in this market is already at 2019 pre -pandemic levels. Year-to-date revenue growth in Latin America is at 30%, with broad activity growth across multiple countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, and Guyana. This growth is expected to strengthen further in the coming years due to ongoing long-cycle development campaigns. By contrast, in the Middle East, where activity has been more subdued in 2021, the market conditions are set for a material uptick of activity in the coming quarters. The combination of short-cycle activity to meet supply commitments, strategic oil capacity expansion, and the acceleration of gas development projects will result in a significant increase in investment throughout 2022 and beyond. Our recent success in tender awards, as detailed in our earnings release, strengthens our market position and with our strong presence and commitment will benefit the most from this exciting outlook in the region. In the offshore markets, we're also set for a strong resurgence this cycle. Rig activity grew for the third sequential quarter internationally and is expected to build on the notable increase in development FIDs in the coming years. Advances in new technology, digital, and integration are driving performance impact offshore -- from discovery to well construction, production, and recovery, and are creating the conditions for offshore operators to reinvest with confidence in this cycle. In North America, the imminent resumption of lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico, where we have significant market presence, will drive additional offshore growth as operators capitalize on the advantage of this prolific basin and its existing takeaway infrastructure and extract more value from the core upstream position through exploration and tiebacks. Taking these factors together a broad offshore resurgence will result from IOCs building on their advantaged hubs, independents fast-tracking development on their recently acquired assets, and NOCs unlocking their gas and oil reserve recovery potential. Our technology, digital enablement, and integration capability are critical advantages in this market environment and are resulting in significant new contract awards, both internationally and in North America. Finally, we're extremely pleased with our customer reception of our Transition Technologies* portfolio and the accelerated adoption of these technologies that reduce the carbon impact of oil and gas operations. This portfolio is focused on fugitive emissions, flaring, and electrification, and is already helping customers decarbonize operations, advancing our net zero ambition and strengthening our sustainability leadership in the industry. Some examples of this impact are cited in our highlights. Turning to the fourth-quarter outlook. Directionally, we anticipate another quarter of growth with an ambition for growth across all divisions. Growth will be led by Production Systems and Digital & Integration, benefiting from a year-end sales uplift tempered by typical seasonality in Reservoir Performance and Well Construction. This should result in an overall sequential growth rate similar to the prior quarter. With this fourth quarter outlook, we expect to reach our double-digit international growth ambition for the second half of 2021, when compared to the second half of 2020. It will also translate into full-year revenue growth, both internationally and in North America after adjusting for the effect of divestitures. Building on third quarter operating margin and recent highs, our ambition is to sustain this level of margin performance in the fourth quarter. Consequently, on a full-year basis, we remain confident in attaining the high end of our guidance of 250 to 300 bps EBITDA margin expansion, an excellent foundation for expansion in the year ahead. Now I would like to close my prepared remarks with our earliest views of 2022. Against the backdrop of the constructive environment I described earlier, our confidence in the onset of an exceptional growth cycle is reinforced. At this early point in the planning cycle, and absent a setback in economic and pandemic recoveries, we anticipate very strong global upstream capital spending growth. This growth will impact all basins, every operating environment, short- and long-cycle activity, and all customer groups. In North America, we anticipate capital spending growth to increase around 20%, impacting both the onshore and offshore markets. Internationally, growth momentum will strengthen and early indications point to strong capital spending growth in the low- to mid-teens, driven by both short-cycle activity and the onset of multiyear capacity expansion plans. Through our performance strategy, we have strengthened our position across multiple dimensions. In North America, we have enhanced our market position and are now biased to accretive growth onshore and will benefit from strong growth offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. And in the international markets, we have built a multiyear pipeline of strong activity in the most prolific basins that will lead the supply response, both in oil and gas. More importantly, we have enhanced our earnings growth potential significantly, as demonstrated by multiple quarters of margin expansion. In North America, our operating margins are primed to exit the year at the highest levels since 2015, which combined with the favorable market position I\u2019ve just described, is an excellent platform for margin expansion. Internationally, we\u2019re also set for peer-leading margin expansion as we exit 2021 with margins above prepandemic levels. The combination of strong activity growth and operating leverage will support durable margin expansion. Additionally, through our fit-for-basin and Transition Technologies and capacity tightening, we see favorable conditions for broader net pricing net gains in the coming years in both North America and the international markets. Finally, as a result of our digital platform strategy and growing customer adoption, we anticipate an acceleration of our digital journey resulting in accretive revenue and earnings growth. Consequently, we expect margins to expand further in 2022, supporting material earnings growth potential and we are increasingly confident in achieving our midcycle adjusted EBITDA margin ambition of 25% or higher and sustaining a double-digit free cash flow margin throughout the cycle. I will now pass the call to Stephane.\nStephane Biguet : Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Third quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.36. This represents an increase of $0.06 compared to the second quarter of this year and an increase of $0.20 when compared to the same period of last year. In addition, we recorded in the third quarter a $0.03 gain relating to a startup company we had previously invested in. This Company was acquired during the quarter and as a result, our ownership interest was converted into shares of a publicly traded company. Overall, our third quarter revenue of $5.8 billion increased 4% sequentially. Pretax operating margins improved 120 basis points to 15.5% and have now increased 5 quarters in a row. Margins expanded sequentially in 3 of our 4 divisions, with very strong incremental margin in both Reservoir Performance and Well Construction. This performance was due to a favorable geographic mix, driven by continued international revenue growth, as well as a favorable technology mix with increased exploration and appraisal activity and new technology adoption. Company-wide adjusted EBITDA margin of 22.2% in the quarter increased 90 basis points sequentially. It is worth noting that this margin expansion was achieved despite the well-documented disruptions in global supply chain systems and inflation in select commodities and materials as well as in logistics. Through our global supply chain organization, we are successfully engaging with our suppliers and customers to jointly navigate inflationary trends. We are collaborating with our customers to optimize planning, and where applicable, make the necessary adjustments through existing contractual clauses or negotiation, . As a result, so far, we have largely been able to shield ourselves from the inflation effects. As the growth cycle accelerates, we will continue to be proactive, dynamically adjusting sourcing strategies and leveraging our diverse global manufacturing footprint and supply network. Let me now go through the third-quarter results for each division. Third quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $812 million was essentially flat sequentially as lower sales of digital solutions were offset by higher APS revenue. Pretax operating margins increased 154 basis points to 35%, largely as a result of improved commodity pricing in our Canada APS project. Reservoir Performance revenue of $1.2 billion increased 7% sequentially. This revenue growth was entirely driven by higher international activity. Margins expanded 202 basis points to 16%, largely due to higher offshore and exploration activity, as well as accelerated new technology adoption. Well Construction revenue of $2.3 billion increased 8% sequentially due to higher land and offshore drilling both internationally and in North America. Margins increased 230 basis points to 15.2% due to the higher drilling activity and a favorable geographical mix. Finally, Production Systems revenue of $1.7 billion was essentially flat sequentially, while margins decreased 27 basis points to 9.9%. Now, turning to our liquidity. Cash flow from operations was once again strong as we generated $1.1 billion of cash flow from operations and free cash flow of $671 million during the quarter. This represented a significant sequential increase when adjusting for last quarter's exceptional tax refund of $477 million. We paid $42 million of severance during the quarter. Excluding these payments, the working capital impact on our cash flow was neutral despite the revenue increase. This was driven by a very strong DSO performance. We expect the fourth quarter to show another quarter of strong free cash flow generation, which positions us favorably to achieve our ambition of delivering full year double-digit free cash flow margins. As a result of this strong cash flow performance, net debt decreased sequentially by $588 million to $12.5 billion. During the quarter, we made capital investments of $399 million. This amount includes CapEx, investments in APS projects, and multiclient. For the full year 2021, we are now expecting to spend approximately $1.6 billion on capital investments. In total, during the first 9 months of the year, we have generated over $2.7 billion of cash flow from operations and $1.7 billion of free cash flow. As a result, we have been able to progress significantly on our commitment to deleverage the balance sheet. This is evidenced by the fact that gross debt has decreased by almost $1.5 billion since the beginning of the year. Net debt has reduced by $1.4 billion during the same period. Overall, I am very pleased with our cash flow performance and the progress we are making towards strengthening the balance sheet. This will provide us with greater flexibility in our capital allocation. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Stephane. So I think we are ready for the Q&A session at this point.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from James West with Evercore ISI.\nJames C. West : So Olivier, 5 sequential quarters in a row of margin growth and really strong execution. How do you think about or how are you considering or planning for continued strong execution as revenue starts to really accelerate as we go into next year?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, James, for the question. Indeed, we are very, very proud and very satisfied with the last 5 quarters. I think they have demonstrated our ability to leverage restructuring, portfolio high-grading, and the foundation we have put in place during this reset we have operated in the last 18 months. But furthermore, I think the -- looking forward as the cycle will unfold, I think there are 2 or 3 characteristics that are \u2013 that will play favorably, and that will help us continue to expand the margin as we have seen in the last quarter. So first, I believe that the market outlook will create a favorable market environment, exposing the basins where we have a strong position internationally and, in particular, Middle East offshore as I commented during my prepared remarks. Secondly, I believe that performance still matters and will matter increasingly. Hence our technology offering, fit-for-basin, Transition Technologies, and integration capability will continue to make a huge impact, will create a premium for service in both Well Construction, Reservoir Performance, and Production Systems. Digital, we see an acceleration going forward, as you have seen that we have continued to evolve, progress, and mature our digital platform strategy, and we are in the last innings of developing this strategy on the platform, on the foundations. Hence, we are now seeing increased adoption and acceleration. And we expect, as I said earlier, that this will be increasingly accretive to growth and earnings going forward. And finally, as the revenue and as the activity both internationally and in North America will increase, this will tighten the market and create a condition for pricing. So when you combine this favorable market exposure, the track record we have, the technology adoption that gives us a premium and a performance differentiation, and integrated contract with digital, you have the formula for supporting our ambition for 25% or higher EBITDA margin by mid-cycle.\nJames C. West : Right. Okay, great, that's very helpful, Olivier. And then, maybe a follow-up on that. On the digital side, this will be the first cycle where we\u2019ll really see digital as a big part of the business. There's been, as you alluded to, widespread adoption but we haven\u2019t yet seen the growth cycle with that adoption. So how do you think that plays out? Is it going to allow you -- I mean, obviously, margins will be part of it that does allow you to grab more market share. I mean, what are the -- what does digital do in an up-cycle that is essentially a strong one like we're projecting?\nOlivier Le Peuch : I think I will highlight 3 things that will be a result of our success and our investment and leadership in digital. First, obviously, the acceleration of digital adoption by customers through our workflow, data, and digital operation offering, and you are seeing elements of this being announced every quarter. And you will continue to see this unfolding across the different customer groups and across different geographies. So this will mean accretive growth in 2022 to our top line by the digital offering, we have. The second aspect is the long-tail effect beyond the cycle. I believe that the effect is -- certainly will last, considering the very significant size of our customer portfolio, the fact that customers are going into it over the long run. We are seeing multiple effects of revenue stream being deployed across multiple quarters and multiple years across the different customer groups we are addressing. And finally, this is generating margins fall-through that are accretive to earnings and will continue to help us operate D&I at or above 30% or mid-30s and also will result in our ability to extract from digital operations and our own operation, particularly integrated performance in Well Construction and Reservoir Performance, the ability to extract more efficiency and hence to expand and support margin expansion on those divisions.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Anderson with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nJ. David Anderson : Want to ask you a couple of questions about the unconventional contracts that you announced in Saudi and Oman. So could you just help us understand the pricing mechanisms there -- are these lump sum? Is there a baseline of stages per day? And also, just curious where you're sourcing all this equipment? Do you have all this equipment? Does it require capital? Just a little bit more background on these contracts, please.\nOlivier Le Peuch : I think this contract are large integrated contracts that we have been winning on our value proposition based on performance, on demonstrated efficiency, and ability to deploy technology that makes an impact on execution. We do have the capacity in place. We have demonstrated to pilots and/or to engagements that we had before that we could deliver the required performance that the customers are expecting. And we have priced it accordingly and we demonstrated during the last few years that we have improved our ability to engage, digitalize our operation, and work with customers to get this integrated contract, whether it\u2019s LSTK or other, to be performing and delivering the margins and earnings we need. So we will continue to extract value from these contracts over a period of time. So we are very proud of winning those contracts. They are based on performance; they are based on technology and our team on the ground. They have done a great job of demonstrating they could take these contracts and get value for customers and for ourselves.\nJ. David Anderson : And then, in terms of the equipment required, do you need to add equipment? Do you need to build out at all?\nOlivier Le Peuch : No, we have started to mobilize this equipment that we have already in place. And obviously, this will pull equipment from other places where we had it. But we have the equipment in place and we\u2019re able to deliver upon the committed contract we are taking in both Oman and in Saudi.\nJ. David Anderson : And so my other question is around offshore. You seem to be a bit more optimistic than most on the offshore market. You announced several awards recently. Are you confident enough to say we're at an inflection point you think, in offshore spend, which I would think would be quite accretive to your margins with higher utilization of OneSubsea? And also all the technology you have in well construction, you also mentioned digital as well. Could you just kind of talk a little bit about maybe kind of how you're seeing this unfolding over the next year or so?\nOlivier Le Peuch : Yes, I think I remain constructive about the offshore environment for a couple of reasons. First, because this offshore environment has been strengthening steadily for the last few quarters, and that's been the rig activity has been increasing lately. And I think we have, in the offshore international market, been growing in the mid-teens, year-on-year and in H2 over H2. So that's proof that this activity is translating into revenue opportunity. And I think the offshore markets, both particularly internationally, have been growing and rebounding in the last \u2013two to four quarters. But now, looking ahead and looking at the activity, we see a lot of leading indicators. First, the FIDs. If you look at the actual FID of this year, or if you look at the projection of some of the WoodMac projection recently published, showing that there will be in excess of $100 million of offshore FID, most likely sanctioned by the end of this year, and that will almost double next year. And out of this, 50% of that will be deepwater. So there is an acceleration of FID back to the 2019 level that is on the horizon. And that is a result of IOCs going to exploit their advantaged basin and focusing hubs, the National Oil Company exploiting and unlocking the oil and gas reserve to participate to the supply. And finally, there has been a lot of assets trading hands in the last few quarters. And these international independents are also pursuing accelerated FID in different basins we are exposed. And the result of that is subsea backlog is growing. We are definitely above 1 book-to-bill ratio. And we will certainly be growing year-on-year in excess of 30% or 40% of booking from 2021 -- 2020 to 2021. So we are indeed quite positive and constructive, and this plays very well to our portfolio because this Well Construction, Reservoir Performance in exploration appraisal, in large offshore contracts are getting the benefit, and it was very visible during the third quarter. So you could take this as a proxy of the future.\nOperator: And our next question is from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America.\nChase Mulvehill: I guess first thing, kind of a macro kind of higher-level question about this investment cycle. There seems to be this growing narrative out there that the oil and gas industry is going to continue to under-invest this cycle given the discipline narrative of the E&P industry and also this energy transition focus. And, obviously, you talked to more E&P and oil and gas producers than probably anybody worldwide. And so, given the commentary that you expect exceptional growth in a multiyear cycle in the oil and gas industry, this obviously leads you to believe that there's not going to be this under-investment going forward. So maybe if you can provide some color around this and thoughts around the disconnect between some investors\u2019 perceptions that you're not going to see a reinvestment cycle going forward.\nOlivier Le Peuch : I think the condition set is a unique combination that we are living with -- from the result of under-investment in the last 5 to 7 years combined with a reset that we have experienced in the industry during 2020, and also an elevated capital discipline, partly North America. When you combine this and look at the demand outlook that will surpass the GDP growth expected for the next 2 or 3 years, that will surpass the 2019 level sometime next year. I think the result of which will create a pull on international supply and will create a necessity for reinvestment in our industry. So the questions are very simple. There's an anticipated deficit of supply if there is no reinvestment in our industry. We have seen that many NOCs have signaled that they are set to reinvest in their capacity going forward. The IOCs are concentrating on their advantaged basins. They will not be the ones leading the growth in this cycle, but they would be the ones pursuing still the advantaged basin to generate the cash they need to transition to new energy. The independents are taking benefit of this position, have inherited some prolific assets and are redeveloping those assets with our support and the support of the entire industry to participate to the supply. So I think the conditions are set undoubtedly, that this demand will have to be met with supply and this supply cannot come with inventory, cannot come with only releasing the OPEC spare capacity. More will have to be built. Hence it will create activity growth in the coming years. And it's not only a short in 2022. This FID I talked about, this capacity expansion in Middle East are long-term projects that will have long-tail effects beyond the '22-'23 horizon.\nChase Mulvehill : Okay. Alright. That's perfect. Just 1 quick follow-up. Just some clarification on your guidance. Fourth quarter, I think you said flat margins. Was that flat consolidated margins or was that flat for each segment? In other words, if you run the mix could actually margins -- because of a favorable mix -- could margins be up?\nOlivier Le Peuch : No, no. Chase, we don't disclose and we don't guide on down to the granular division. I think we're talking about a flattish margin, global margin, and in a sense maintaining very, very high-margin and exiting in the mid-teens globally for the Company as operating margins and the same level of EBITDA margin. So that's the -- what matters for us is the exit rate and the implication of this exit rate as we enter 2022 as a platform, as a foundation for margin expansion going forward. So the mix is giving us this result of flat or about mid-teens margin, and that's the ambition, and we are very proud of this -- maintaining this level of margins.\nOperator: Our next question is from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan Chase.\nArun Jayaram : Yes. My first question is, Olivier, there's 3 to 4 million barrels of productive capacity offline from OPEC. And as the cartel methodically brings back this output, call it in 4K BD increments. I wanted to get your thoughts, is this creating any near-term service opportunities for you? And I was wondering if you could maybe elaborate on any shifts globally in spending from maintenance CapEx type spending, to growth and in productive capacity, oil and gas, and what this means for Schlumberger.\nOlivier Le Peuch : Yes, I think the OPEC+ will continue to release this increment of oil to the market to be behind the supply curve, beyond the demand curve. But we are continuing to see an increase of intervention activity -- short-cycle activity that is starting to materialize in the OPEC+ countries where we are seeing mobilization of intervention stimulation as we have seen lifting and production maintenance activities. So that's the effect on short-cycle. This will also include a rig remobilization to do some infill drilling to start to support this increment of barrels for the country that has the capacity to expand fast. And this will turn into more long-cycle, as both the gas development is accelerating and you have seen the Jafurah announcement from Saudi and the continuation of a large gas in the Middle East and elsewhere, as well as the commitment that 2 or 3 countries have taken in the Middle East particularly around the expansion of production capacity, permanent capacity towards the horizon of 2024-27, depending on the country. So what you talk about has an impact on short-cycle, but this is an underlying activity growth coming from long-cycle as well.\nOperator: And our next question is -- Arun, do you have any follow-up? We'll move on and we'll go to line of Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley.\nConnor Lynagh : Just on the first point here. I just wanted to return to Chase's question and just think through some of the dynamics in the fourth quarter here. So I would think with digital being an area that you called out as particularly strong in the fourth quarter, as well as some activity growth that you're expecting, it would seem, assuming that supply chain issues aren't getting worse, that you would naturally have some expansion in the margin in the fourth quarter. So I'm just curious, what I'm sort of missing in that framework. What's your -- what type of issues are you seeing or accounting for?\nOlivier Le Peuch : No, it's a mix effect. I think you have to account for 2 effects: first, the production system that had some logistics and supply-related delay into delivery will have a sizable catch-up in the fourth quarter. And this segment where we are very happy with the double-digit margin and anticipate for margin expansion, this will be, in a mix, slightly dilutive to our margin overall. And that will offset some of the -- what you could expect from a digital fall through where we expect a strong end-of-year sales. But also you have to add to the mix the fact that you are in going into a seasonal effect in Northern Hemisphere and to lower mix of exploration and appraisal, that will have an effect and seasonality of Reservoir Performance. That is something that we -- that happens every year. And where the third quarter is typically the high-margin quarter due to this probable offshore operation mix, that decline for 1 or 2 quarters before it rebounds strongly every spring. So that's when you put this mix together, you result into maintaining the margin at the level we are putting, which is something remarkable and entering the 2022 on a high ground.\nConnor Lynagh : That's helpful context, thank you. Second 1 is a higher-level question here. So you did have some integrated projects you disclosed in the press release. As we think about this portion of your business, I mean, it certainly has been characterized by yourself and peers as probably the later area where you were going to see pricing improvement. But I guess my question is effectively why? It seemed to me that the service companies that can really execute that kind of large-scale integrated work is a very short list, and it seems like there's a lot of value to be delivered to the customer from that type of contract. \u2013So why isn't this an area that we should be more excited about over the next year or 2 here?\nOlivier Le Peuch : Well, I think it has remained competitive due to the sheer size of this contract. But until the capacity in the market is stretched and is tightening, I think you will see that the market remains competitive in large integrated contract. But our capital discipline, the activity growing in all basins is set to create a condition for the tightening and hence, a lifting on the core pricing of our offering. Now, we are still very satisfied with these awards because we have demonstrated that we -- through integration, through performance, through technology, including digital and [inaudible], we have been differentiated in our ability to sustain our performance on those contracts and create the value we need to elevate the margins.\nOperator: And next we have a question from Scott Gruber with Citigroup.\nScott Gruber : You're feeling better about your mid-cycle, 25%-plus EBITDA margin target, which seems warranted given the backdrop here. But if I just look at consensus estimates, at least the market believes it would take you a while to achieve. So if you kind of extend consensus, assume 10% annual growth in '24, '25, extend the 30%-ish type incrementals, the market is forecasting in '22 and '23, it would actually take about 5 years to get to 25%-plus EBITDA margin. Do you think you can outpace 30% incrementals over the next few years and hit that 25% margin faster than 5 years?\nOlivier Le Peuch : I think first it's not a matter of if but when we\u2019ll hit and exceed this 25% EBITDA. We have been doing it. We have been delivering over 30% recently. The market condition as we foresee for -- going forward, as I\u2019ve commented earlier, favorable with the right basin and operating environment mix that is favorable to our margin mix. Our technology adoption, performance through integration and digital operation, and accretive digital mix, I think, are putting the condition before pricing kicks in to give us the outlook, a positive outlook on this so that we will indeed ambition to achieve this before 5 years, clearly.\nScott Gruber : And do you think you can get there without much pricing? The pricing gains just always take a while to kind of move across discrete products into the bundled contracts and then kind of into your average selling price. Do you think you can get the other drivers and get there faster without much pricing?\nOlivier Le Peuch : Some of the performance to-date, okay, pulling and elevating the performance of our Divisions to their highest level in 3 years or more and restoring to portfolio high-grading North America already proved that we can move our margins through execution, through performance, through high-grading visibly. So can we move forward? I think pricing will only accelerate the time by which this will be met. But we are still constructive that we will achieve this independently of pricing and that pricing will come as a bonus to elevate beyond 25%.\nOperator: Our next question is we're going back to line of Arun Jayaram.\nArun Jayaram: So Olivier, year-to-date, you've reduced debt by about $1.5 billion. And I wanted to get your thoughts on how you're thinking about the priorities for free cash flow generation between cash return, the dividend, and the balance sheet, and also how you're thinking about Schlumberger's investment in Liberty now that the lockup recently expired.\nStephane Biguet: I\u2019ll take this, Arun. Look, our immediate priority remains the deleveraging of the balance sheet. And yes, we've progressed quite well and we are very happy with its own. So now we do have a clear line of sight to achieving our 2x net debt-to-EBITDA target leverage, and we said we should do that by the end of 2022. With the earnings expansion, we are expecting in this growth cycle and our continuous focus on capital stewardship, yes, we will continue to generate significant excess cash in the next few years. So this will allow us to maintain a healthy balance sheet, and it will give us the flexibility to increase returns to shareholders, as well as fund new growth opportunities. As it relates to returns to shareholders, this is something we will continue to review with our Board of Directors as the cycle unfolds and the deleveraging of our balance sheet accelerates. And as it relates to new growth opportunities, we will -- whether it's in digital, New Energy, any new investment, we will continue to look at under the strict lens of our returns-based capital stewardship framework. Your question on Liberty. Clearly we are happy with the transaction we made now more than a year ago. We are benefiting from the recovery in North America through the significant appreciation of our equity stake there. And yes, monetization is clearly an option. The timing and the pace and the magnitude of this monetization will be based on the market conditions and the outlook. But we'll make sure we'll optimize it basically.\nOperator: Next we'll go to the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo.\nRoger Reed: I guess I'd like to come back to the 25% margin goal for EBITDA but think of it maybe in a slightly different way. You\u2019ve got obviously the typical cyclical recovery, so utilization, you'll get some pricing. You talked about digital as one of the big separating factors. And I was wondering if -- as you look at the goal of the 25%, maybe a weighting of where you think that could go if you thought what would be normal for utilization, normal for pricing, and then digital on top? Is it a 1/3, 1/3, 1/3? Is it 50-50? I'm just kind of curious how we should think about that coming through.\nOlivier Le Peuch : I think it would be difficult to give you a precise outlook because this will depend on every division and almost on every geography, depending on a mix outlook we foresee. But suffice to say that I think our operating leverage will indeed be a base for margin expansion to the way we execute with efficiency using our own digital transformation to execute and extract performance from our execution. So that's the base. Above that, I will place the technology first and technology mix adoption from Fit-For-Basin that are highly differentiated and successful in all basins. I will include the Transition Technologies that are starting to emerge as a unique differentiator. And it will include also the integration delivery performance in integration contract. And then indeed, and you are correct, our digital expansion will be favorable on top. So I think you have these 3 things, but I don't want to be starting to be trying to create a boundary between these, I don't think is appropriate. And I think it will depend on every basin and every division will have a different trajectory, but we are confident that across the profile we have considering the international mix, considering the offshore, considering the technology adoption that is coming back, I think this -- we have the path forward.\nRoger Reed: Okay, great. And then just an unrelated follow-up. I was curious, you talked about a lot of major projects and so forth. globally. We've seen obviously some pretty extreme pricing in LNG and natural gas overall. So if you just kind of looked at natural gas as a driver on the project side or the activity side, anything globally you could say? It looks like it's improved over recent months or recent quarters. Or anything on the sort of larger project side there (inaudible).\nOlivier Le Peuch : Gas is there \u2013for a long time as a critical supply, as a transition fuel as well. So I think you see that the existing reserves, be it on unconventional or conventional, offshore and onshore will be commercialized by our customers as long as they have a path to market through LNG or they have a path to market to pipeline. So we see this accelerating. You have seen some of the critical announcement we made this morning relating to onshore, offshore, \u2013unconventional, and conventional gas developments and we see it as a trend that is not about to stop. Now, will it accelerate? I think the gas supply/demand is misbalanced this year, will recover a little bit next year, but will continue its strong trajectory going forward. And there are few countries that are committed to accelerate their gas transition. India is the most visible one, that will step change their consumption of gas and will then participate to fuel the gas demand and will itself expand in gas supply as well domestically. So Middle East, domestic gas, India as an engine of growth for gas beyond the current mix and some specific security supply that will trigger some gas development from existing gas, the redevelopment or short-cycle activity. So I'm optimistic, hence, very, very pleased with the gas contract we have been winning this quarter.\nOperator: And our next question is from Waqar Syed with ATB Capital Markets.\nWaqar Syed: Olivier, just 1 broader question. You've given us some good guidance on upstream capital spending for international markets and North American markets for next year. Now with respect to exploration budgets in particular, do you see the growth rate of exploration spending in line with otherwise global spending or higher or lower?\nOlivier Le Peuch : It's too early to give a specific guidance for exploration. What I will say for exploration is that we are seeing 2 things coming back. We are seeing some seismic activity coming back, including there are some proof that the seismic boat utilization is going. But what is more critical is the near-field exploration is triggering more activity in exploration going forward as everybody wants to get better return on their existing infrastructure to create tieback. And hence, we have seen some licensing rounds as well. So licensing rounds, some seismic survey coming back, and exploration, near-field exploration for future infill or tieback is what we see. So to give you a magnitude directionally, it will increase, but to keep in mind it is too early.\nWaqar Syed: Okay. And then, with respect to the APS business, previously, there were some plans for asset divestitures. Are those plans on hold or are you still pursuing those?\nStephane Biguet : Look, Waqar, for APS assets in Canada, which is what we discussed previously, we have received offers with various commercial constructs, and now we are just in the process of evaluating the potential merits and risks associated with those proposals. So this is what we are doing now. In the meantime, we are, of course, managing this asset as to optimize cash flows in the current commodity pricing environment, and it generates quite a lot of cash flow.\nOperator: And next we go to the line of Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta: I just want to go back to Arun\u2019s question on deleveraging. As you think about the right -- the optimal capital structure, is 2x net debt to EBITDA still the normalized way you would think about the business? And based on the visibility you have on the cash flow, when do you think you'll be in a position to hit that target?\nStephane Biguet : It's a good question, Neil. Is 2x the right level? You could argue it's a good level throughout the cycle. Now in an up-cycle with the cash you generate, the excess cash we would probably be happy to go below 2x, and it will give us the required flexibility, as I said, to look at growth, additional growth opportunities, and potential incremental shareholder returns. So we may not stop at 2x. We can take this as an intermediary step and we -- 2x will just be an average throughout the cycle, I think, is the right level.\nNeil Mehta: Yes. The follow-up is just on the digital business. You spent a lot of time talking about it on this call, but do you think you'll -- the company will ever get credit for the digital business which is highly valuable, terrific margins, embedded within a more volatile services and technology business? Does the -- does that asset ultimately belong outside of your core business? And I look at Emerson and Aspen, the transaction that they recently did, try to put a better marker on the value of digital. It's a high-level question, but curious on what the optimal way to showcase the value of that business is.\nOlivier Le Peuch : So first, we will continue to pursue. We have made investment into a digital platform. We are using it both internally and externally. We have critical customers that depend upon us and will continue to trust us for the future. So we are using it to accelerate our growth, be accretive on our growth and our returns. And whether we are getting the right value, I think it's up to you to review and give us the multiple expansion that we deserve for this. I think we have been, so far, demonstrating enough margins -- sustained margin. To this we anticipate the growth to now come to play visibly in the coming years. And I think our leadership in this is recognized. And yes, I would expect that this will be turning into a premium for valuation. I believe it's time to go. I'm not sure that we have time for another question.\nOperator: No further time, you may conclude.\nOlivier Le Peuch : So thank you very much. So I would like to conclude the call and I would like to leave you with a few key takeaways. First, during the third quarter, our growth momentum was sustained, both internally, internationally and in North America and drove peer-leading margin expansion, reflecting our operating leverage, advantaged market position, and increased technology adoption. We also generated sizable free cash flow, allowing us to materially reduce our net debt. Secondly, our performance in execution, our proven integration capabilities, and our differentiated technology and digital portfolio are increasingly resonating with our customers and have resulted in sizable awards in the quarter across Middle East, offshore, and in gas development, in particular, all critical markets as the up-cycle unfolds. Thirdly, we're confident that the momentum of this up-cycle will continue allowing us to close this year with another quarter of revenue and earnings growth, resulting in full-year sequential growth internationally and pro forma North America, and full year margin expansion on the high-end of our guidance. Finally. with the backdrop of strengthening demand in the energy markets, the macro conditions are increasingly set for an exceptional multiyear growth cycle unfolding broadly during 2022, both internationally and North America and resulting in significant earnings growth potential for Schlumberger. Ladies and gentlemen, I could not be more satisfied with our strategy execution progress to-date, the enthusiasm of our entire team, and the elevated trust of our customers. I look forward to the coming quarters with increased confidence. Our returns-focused strategic execution has created the conditions for a unique outperformance in our core and digital offering at the onset of this up-cycle whilst elevating our sustainability commitment and accelerating our new energy strategic initiatives. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference Service. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Stephane Biguet",
            "content": "Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Third quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.36. This represents an increase of $0.06 compared to the second quarter of this year and an increase of $0.20 when compared to the same period of last year. In addition, we recorded in the third quarter a $0.03 gain relating to a startup company we had previously invested in. This Company was acquired during the quarter and as a result, our ownership interest was converted into shares of a publicly traded company. Overall, our third quarter revenue of $5.8 billion increased 4% sequentially. Pretax operating margins improved 120 basis points to 15.5% and have now increased 5 quarters in a row. Margins expanded sequentially in 3 of our 4 divisions, with very strong incremental margin in both Reservoir Performance and Well Construction. This performance was due to a favorable geographic mix, driven by continued international revenue growth, as well as a favorable technology mix with increased exploration and appraisal activity and new technology adoption. Company-wide adjusted EBITDA margin of 22.2% in the quarter increased 90 basis points sequentially. It is worth noting that this margin expansion was achieved despite the well-documented disruptions in global supply chain systems and inflation in select commodities and materials as well as in logistics. Through our global supply chain organization, we are successfully engaging with our suppliers and customers to jointly navigate inflationary trends. We are collaborating with our customers to optimize planning, and where applicable, make the necessary adjustments through existing contractual clauses or negotiation, . As a result, so far, we have largely been able to shield ourselves from the inflation effects. As the growth cycle accelerates, we will continue to be proactive, dynamically adjusting sourcing strategies and leveraging our diverse global manufacturing footprint and supply network. Let me now go through the third-quarter results for each division. Third quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $812 million was essentially flat sequentially as lower sales of digital solutions were offset by higher APS revenue. Pretax operating margins increased 154 basis points to 35%, largely as a result of improved commodity pricing in our Canada APS project. Reservoir Performance revenue of $1.2 billion increased 7% sequentially. This revenue growth was entirely driven by higher international activity. Margins expanded 202 basis points to 16%, largely due to higher offshore and exploration activity, as well as accelerated new technology adoption. Well Construction revenue of $2.3 billion increased 8% sequentially due to higher land and offshore drilling both internationally and in North America. Margins increased 230 basis points to 15.2% due to the higher drilling activity and a favorable geographical mix. Finally, Production Systems revenue of $1.7 billion was essentially flat sequentially, while margins decreased 27 basis points to 9.9%. Now, turning to our liquidity. Cash flow from operations was once again strong as we generated $1.1 billion of cash flow from operations and free cash flow of $671 million during the quarter. This represented a significant sequential increase when adjusting for last quarter's exceptional tax refund of $477 million. We paid $42 million of severance during the quarter. Excluding these payments, the working capital impact on our cash flow was neutral despite the revenue increase. This was driven by a very strong DSO performance. We expect the fourth quarter to show another quarter of strong free cash flow generation, which positions us favorably to achieve our ambition of delivering full year double-digit free cash flow margins. As a result of this strong cash flow performance, net debt decreased sequentially by $588 million to $12.5 billion. During the quarter, we made capital investments of $399 million. This amount includes CapEx, investments in APS projects, and multiclient. For the full year 2021, we are now expecting to spend approximately $1.6 billion on capital investments. In total, during the first 9 months of the year, we have generated over $2.7 billion of cash flow from operations and $1.7 billion of free cash flow. As a result, we have been able to progress significantly on our commitment to deleverage the balance sheet. This is evidenced by the fact that gross debt has decreased by almost $1.5 billion since the beginning of the year. Net debt has reduced by $1.4 billion during the same period. Overall, I am very pleased with our cash flow performance and the progress we are making towards strengthening the balance sheet. This will provide us with greater flexibility in our capital allocation. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier. I'll take this, Arun. Look, our immediate priority remains the deleveraging of the balance sheet. And yes, we've progressed quite well and we are very happy with its own. So now we do have a clear line of sight to achieving our 2x net debt-to-EBITDA target leverage, and we said we should do that by the end of 2022. With the earnings expansion, we are expecting in this growth cycle and our continuous focus on capital stewardship, yes, we will continue to generate significant excess cash in the next few years. So this will allow us to maintain a healthy balance sheet, and it will give us the flexibility to increase returns to shareholders, as well as fund new growth opportunities. As it relates to returns to shareholders, this is something we will continue to review with our Board of Directors as the cycle unfolds and the deleveraging of our balance sheet accelerates. And as it relates to new growth opportunities, we will -- whether it's in digital, New Energy, any new investment, we will continue to look at under the strict lens of our returns-based capital stewardship framework.

            "name": "Olivier Le Peuch",
            "content": "Thank you, ND Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us on the call. In my prepared remarks today, I will cover 3 topics. Our third quarter results, our view of the near-term macro, and the exceptional growth opportunity ahead of us. I will then share some insights on the Middle East and offshore markets and finally a first view of the 2022 growth outlook. Stephane will then give more details on our financial results and we'll open the floor for questions. The third quarter results further emphasize our returns focus, consistent execution, and the advantaged mix of our portfolio. Growth momentum was sustained and we delivered a fifth consecutive quarter of margin expansion, achieving the highest pretax operating margin since 2015 and cash flow from operations in excess $1 billion. Let me share with you some performance highlights from the quarter across our core, digital, and new energy. In our core, first, margin expansion was led by Well Construction and Reservoir Performance where we fully seized the sequential growth opportunity driving operating margins in both these divisions above mid-teens, the highest levels in the last 3 years. Revenue quality improved, boosted by a favorable activity mix and higher new technology uptake that delivered strong margin expansion. Second, internationally, we recorded growth in all 3 areas with revenue up 11% year-on-year, consistent with our ambition of double-digit revenue growth compared to the second half of 2020. International margin further expanded, exceeding prepandemic levels and are at the highest since 2018. In North America, revenue growth was sustained, albeit impacted by transitory supply and logistics disruption. Margins also continued to expand with operating margins firmly at double digits. Finally, we are pleased with the very sizable activity pipeline secured during the quarter, through competitive tenders, direct awards, and contract extensions, some of which included net pricing improvement, building on our differentiated performance, integration capabilities, and technology. These wins enhance our market position, creating a long tail of activity and a platform to further new technology adoption and digital deployment, strengthening our leadership as we enter an exceptional growth cycle. We are delivering on the promise of our performance strategy, which is increasingly impacting our top- and bottom-line results, both in North America and internationally. As the cycle accelerates, we will leverage our advantaged platform to capture the exciting growth and outperform the market in our core going forward. Moving to Digital: we continued to progress our platform strategy this quarter, expanding our offering through the acquisition of Independent Data Services and a strategic investment in DeepIQ to further advance our digital technology offering and the adoption of AI solutions in our industry. In digital production operations, we announced a partnership with AVEVA to expand powerful edge and IoT solutions to the field, complementing our Agora* platform and Sensia solutions. And in digital drilling, we successfully completed the first fully automated section drilled offshore at the Hebron platform for ExxonMobil in Canada, as you have seen in this morning's earnings release. This achievement is a significant step for our industry, particularly offshore, and signals a momentous opportunity to apply digital technology to create a step change in well construction safety, performance, and carbon footprint. As shared recently, we are seeing the adoption of digital solutions accelerate in our industry. And whilst we are in the early innings, we are excited about the prospect of transitioning the majority of our software customer base of over 1,700 companies to our digital platform during the next few years. This growing adoption will generate an expanding set of digital revenue streams over a long horizon as we transition every customer to new digital solutions for the data, workflows, and operations. Moving to New Energy, we advanced our portfolio by taking a position stationary energy storage through our strategic investment in EnerVenue, a company with differentiated metal-hydrogen battery technology. This represents a new opportunity set and an expansion of total addressable market in a sector with significant growth opportunities. In geoenergy, following the success of the pilot in our technology facility in France, Celsius Energy has secured 5 commercial contracts in Europe. This is a significant achievement in the commercialization roadmap for Celsius as a low-carbon solution for heating and cooling buildings, contributing to global efforts in reducing emissions. To conclude on this quarter's performance, we once again demonstrated excellent progress in our strategic execution across our portfolio, supporting outstanding results. And I want to thank the entire Schlumberger team, not only for delivering another strong quarter, but for their unwavering efforts to create enduring value for our customers and our shareholders. Now I would like to turn to the near-term macro and growth opportunity ahead of us. The market fundamentals have improved steadily throughout 2021, especially over the last few weeks, with oil and gas prices attaining recent highs, inventories at their lowest levels in recent history, a rebound in demand and encouraging trends in the pandemic containment efforts. This strengthening in industry fundamentals, combined with the action of OPEC+ and continued capital discipline in North America have firmly established a prospect of an exceptional multiyear growth cycle ahead. In the international markets, all regions are set to benefit from this highly favorable environment, something not seen internationally since the last supercycle. This expansion will occur at different \u2013paces across different basins, operating environments, and customer groups resulting in a sustained multipronged growth cycle. Our broad exposure across these different dimensions put us in an advantaged position to fully seize this growth opportunity. For example, this growth inflection is already visibly underway in Latin America, sparked by the resumption of exploration and the initiation of long-cycle development campaigns. Activity has strengthened throughout 2021 and revenue in this market is already at 2019 pre -pandemic levels. Year-to-date revenue growth in Latin America is at 30%, with broad activity growth across multiple countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, and Guyana. This growth is expected to strengthen further in the coming years due to ongoing long-cycle development campaigns. By contrast, in the Middle East, where activity has been more subdued in 2021, the market conditions are set for a material uptick of activity in the coming quarters. The combination of short-cycle activity to meet supply commitments, strategic oil capacity expansion, and the acceleration of gas development projects will result in a significant increase in investment throughout 2022 and beyond. Our recent success in tender awards, as detailed in our earnings release, strengthens our market position and with our strong presence and commitment will benefit the most from this exciting outlook in the region. In the offshore markets, we're also set for a strong resurgence this cycle. Rig activity grew for the third sequential quarter internationally and is expected to build on the notable increase in development FIDs in the coming years. Advances in new technology, digital, and integration are driving performance impact offshore -- from discovery to well construction, production, and recovery, and are creating the conditions for offshore operators to reinvest with confidence in this cycle. In North America, the imminent resumption of lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico, where we have significant market presence, will drive additional offshore growth as operators capitalize on the advantage of this prolific basin and its existing takeaway infrastructure and extract more value from the core upstream position through exploration and tiebacks. Taking these factors together a broad offshore resurgence will result from IOCs building on their advantaged hubs, independents fast-tracking development on their recently acquired assets, and NOCs unlocking their gas and oil reserve recovery potential. Our technology, digital enablement, and integration capability are critical advantages in this market environment and are resulting in significant new contract awards, both internationally and in North America. Finally, we're extremely pleased with our customer reception of our Transition Technologies* portfolio and the accelerated adoption of these technologies that reduce the carbon impact of oil and gas operations. This portfolio is focused on fugitive emissions, flaring, and electrification, and is already helping customers decarbonize operations, advancing our net zero ambition and strengthening our sustainability leadership in the industry. Some examples of this impact are cited in our highlights. Turning to the fourth-quarter outlook. Directionally, we anticipate another quarter of growth with an ambition for growth across all divisions. Growth will be led by Production Systems and Digital & Integration, benefiting from a year-end sales uplift tempered by typical seasonality in Reservoir Performance and Well Construction. This should result in an overall sequential growth rate similar to the prior quarter. With this fourth quarter outlook, we expect to reach our double-digit international growth ambition for the second half of 2021, when compared to the second half of 2020. It will also translate into full-year revenue growth, both internationally and in North America after adjusting for the effect of divestitures. Building on third quarter operating margin and recent highs, our ambition is to sustain this level of margin performance in the fourth quarter. Consequently, on a full-year basis, we remain confident in attaining the high end of our guidance of 250 to 300 bps EBITDA margin expansion, an excellent foundation for expansion in the year ahead. Now I would like to close my prepared remarks with our earliest views of 2022. Against the backdrop of the constructive environment I described earlier, our confidence in the onset of an exceptional growth cycle is reinforced. At this early point in the planning cycle, and absent a setback in economic and pandemic recoveries, we anticipate very strong global upstream capital spending growth. This growth will impact all basins, every operating environment, short- and long-cycle activity, and all customer groups. In North America, we anticipate capital spending growth to increase around 20%, impacting both the onshore and offshore markets. Internationally, growth momentum will strengthen and early indications point to strong capital spending growth in the low- to mid-teens, driven by both short-cycle activity and the onset of multiyear capacity expansion plans. Through our performance strategy, we have strengthened our position across multiple dimensions. In North America, we have enhanced our market position and are now biased to accretive growth onshore and will benefit from strong growth offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. And in the international markets, we have built a multiyear pipeline of strong activity in the most prolific basins that will lead the supply response, both in oil and gas. More importantly, we have enhanced our earnings growth potential significantly, as demonstrated by multiple quarters of margin expansion. In North America, our operating margins are primed to exit the year at the highest levels since 2015, which combined with the favorable market position I've just described, is an excellent platform for margin expansion. Internationally, we're also set for peer-leading margin expansion as we exit 2021 with margins above prepandemic levels. The combination of strong activity growth and operating leverage will support durable margin expansion. Additionally, through our fit-for-basin and Transition Technologies and capacity tightening, we see favorable conditions for broader net pricing net gains in the coming years in both North America and the international markets. Finally, as a result of our digital platform strategy and growing customer adoption, we anticipate an acceleration of our digital journey resulting in accretive revenue and earnings growth. Consequently, we expect margins to expand further in 2022, supporting material earnings growth potential and we are increasingly confident in achieving our midcycle adjusted EBITDA margin ambition of 25% or higher and sustaining a double-digit free cash flow margin throughout the cycle. I will now pass the call to Stephane. Thank you, Stephane. So I think we are ready for the Q&A session at this point. Thank you, James, for the question. Indeed, we are very, very proud and very satisfied with the last 5 quarters. I think they have demonstrated our ability to leverage restructuring, portfolio high-grading, and the foundation we have put in place during this reset we have operated in the last 18 months. But furthermore, I think the -- looking forward as the cycle will unfold, I think there are 2 or 3 characteristics that are \u2013 that will play favorably, and that will help us continue to expand the margin as we have seen in the last quarter. So first, I believe that the market outlook will create a favorable market environment, exposing the basins where we have a strong position internationally and, in particular, Middle East offshore as I commented during my prepared remarks. Secondly, I believe that performance still matters and will matter increasingly. Hence our technology offering, fit-for-basin, Transition Technologies, and integration capability will continue to make a huge impact, will create a premium for service in both Well Construction, Reservoir Performance, and Production Systems. Digital, we see an acceleration going forward, as you have seen that we have continued to evolve, progress, and mature our digital platform strategy, and we are in the last innings of developing this strategy on the platform, on the foundations. Hence, we are now seeing increased adoption and acceleration. And we expect, as I said earlier, that this will be increasingly accretive to growth and earnings going forward. And finally, as the revenue and as the activity both internationally and in North America will increase, this will tighten the market and create a condition for pricing. So when you combine this favorable market exposure, the track record we have, the technology adoption that gives us a premium and a performance differentiation, and integrated contract with digital, you have the formula for supporting our ambition for 25% or higher EBITDA margin by mid-cycle. I think I will highlight 3 things that will be a result of our success and our investment and leadership in digital. First, obviously, the acceleration of digital adoption by customers through our workflow, data, and digital operation offering, and you are seeing elements of this being announced every quarter. And you will continue to see this unfolding across the different customer groups and across different geographies. So this will mean accretive growth in 2022 to our top line by the digital offering, we have. The second aspect is the long-tail effect beyond the cycle. I believe that the effect is -- certainly will last, considering the very significant size of our customer portfolio, the fact that customers are going into it over the long run. We are seeing multiple effects of revenue stream being deployed across multiple quarters and multiple years across the different customer groups we are addressing. And finally, this is generating margins fall-through that are accretive to earnings and will continue to help us operate D&I at or above 30% or mid-30s and also will result in our ability to extract from digital operations and our own operation, particularly integrated performance in Well Construction and Reservoir Performance, the ability to extract more efficiency and hence to expand and support margin expansion on those divisions. I think this contract are large integrated contracts that we have been winning on our value proposition based on performance, on demonstrated efficiency, and ability to deploy technology that makes an impact on execution. We do have the capacity in place. We have demonstrated to pilots and/or to engagements that we had before that we could deliver the required performance that the customers are expecting. And we have priced it accordingly and we demonstrated during the last few years that we have improved our ability to engage, digitalize our operation, and work with customers to get this integrated contract, whether it's LSTK or other, to be performing and delivering the margins and earnings we need. So we will continue to extract value from these contracts over a period of time. So we are very proud of winning those contracts. They are based on performance; they are based on technology and our team on the ground. They have done a great job of demonstrating they could take these contracts and get value for customers and for ourselves. No, we have started to mobilize this equipment that we have already in place. And obviously, this will pull equipment from other places where we had it. But we have the equipment in place and we're able to deliver upon the committed contract we are taking in both Oman and in Saudi. Yes, I think I remain constructive about the offshore environment for a couple of reasons. First, because this offshore environment has been strengthening steadily for the last few quarters, and that's been the rig activity has been increasing lately. And I think we have, in the offshore international market, been growing in the mid-teens, year-on-year and in H2 over H2. So that's proof that this activity is translating into revenue opportunity. And I think the offshore markets, both particularly internationally, have been growing and rebounding in the last \u2013two to four quarters. But now, looking ahead and looking at the activity, we see a lot of leading indicators. First, the FIDs. If you look at the actual FID of this year, or if you look at the projection of some of the WoodMac projection recently published, showing that there will be in excess of $100 million of offshore FID, most likely sanctioned by the end of this year, and that will almost double next year. And out of this, 50% of that will be deepwater. So there is an acceleration of FID back to the 2019 level that is on the horizon. And that is a result of IOCs going to exploit their advantaged basin and focusing hubs, the National Oil Company exploiting and unlocking the oil and gas reserve to participate to the supply. And finally, there has been a lot of assets trading hands in the last few quarters. And these international independents are also pursuing accelerated FID in different basins we are exposed. And the result of that is subsea backlog is growing. We are definitely above 1 book-to-bill ratio. And we will certainly be growing year-on-year in excess of 30% or 40% of booking from 2021 -- 2020 to 2021. So we are indeed quite positive and constructive, and this plays very well to our portfolio because this Well Construction, Reservoir Performance in exploration appraisal, in large offshore contracts are getting the benefit, and it was very visible during the third quarter. So you could take this as a proxy of the future. I think the condition set is a unique combination that we are living with -- from the result of under-investment in the last 5 to 7 years combined with a reset that we have experienced in the industry during 2020, and also an elevated capital discipline, partly North America. When you combine this and look at the demand outlook that will surpass the GDP growth expected for the next 2 or 3 years, that will surpass the 2019 level sometime next year. I think the result of which will create a pull on international supply and will create a necessity for reinvestment in our industry. So the questions are very simple. There's an anticipated deficit of supply if there is no reinvestment in our industry. We have seen that many NOCs have signaled that they are set to reinvest in their capacity going forward. The IOCs are concentrating on their advantaged basins. They will not be the ones leading the growth in this cycle, but they would be the ones pursuing still the advantaged basin to generate the cash they need to transition to new energy. The independents are taking benefit of this position, have inherited some prolific assets and are redeveloping those assets with our support and the support of the entire industry to participate to the supply. So I think the conditions are set undoubtedly, that this demand will have to be met with supply and this supply cannot come with inventory, cannot come with only releasing the OPEC spare capacity. More will have to be built. Hence it will create activity growth in the coming years. And it's not only a short in 2022. This FID I talked about, this capacity expansion in Middle East are long-term projects that will have long-tail effects beyond the '22-'23 horizon. No, no. Chase, we don't disclose and we don't guide on down to the granular division. I think we're talking about a flattish margin, global margin, and in a sense maintaining very, very high-margin and exiting in the mid-teens globally for the Company as operating margins and the same level of EBITDA margin. So that's the -- what matters for us is the exit rate and the implication of this exit rate as we enter 2022 as a platform, as a foundation for margin expansion going forward. So the mix is giving us this result of flat or about mid-teens margin, and that's the ambition, and we are very proud of this -- maintaining this level of margins. Yes, I think the OPEC+ will continue to release this increment of oil to the market to be behind the supply curve, beyond the demand curve. But we are continuing to see an increase of intervention activity -- short-cycle activity that is starting to materialize in the OPEC+ countries where we are seeing mobilization of intervention stimulation as we have seen lifting and production maintenance activities. So that's the effect on short-cycle. This will also include a rig remobilization to do some infill drilling to start to support this increment of barrels for the country that has the capacity to expand fast. And this will turn into more long-cycle, as both the gas development is accelerating and you have seen the Jafurah announcement from Saudi and the continuation of a large gas in the Middle East and elsewhere, as well as the commitment that 2 or 3 countries have taken in the Middle East particularly around the expansion of production capacity, permanent capacity towards the horizon of 2024-27, depending on the country. So what you talk about has an impact on short-cycle, but this is an underlying activity growth coming from long-cycle as well. No, it's a mix effect. I think you have to account for 2 effects: first, the production system that had some logistics and supply-related delay into delivery will have a sizable catch-up in the fourth quarter. And this segment where we are very happy with the double-digit margin and anticipate for margin expansion, this will be, in a mix, slightly dilutive to our margin overall. And that will offset some of the -- what you could expect from a digital fall through where we expect a strong end-of-year sales. But also you have to add to the mix the fact that you are in going into a seasonal effect in Northern Hemisphere and to lower mix of exploration and appraisal, that will have an effect and seasonality of Reservoir Performance. That is something that we -- that happens every year. And where the third quarter is typically the high-margin quarter due to this probable offshore operation mix, that decline for 1 or 2 quarters before it rebounds strongly every spring. So that's when you put this mix together, you result into maintaining the margin at the level we are putting, which is something remarkable and entering the 2022 on a high ground. Well, I think it has remained competitive due to the sheer size of this contract. But until the capacity in the market is stretched and is tightening, I think you will see that the market remains competitive in large integrated contract. But our capital discipline, the activity growing in all basins is set to create a condition for the tightening and hence, a lifting on the core pricing of our offering. Now, we are still very satisfied with these awards because we have demonstrated that we -- through integration, through performance, through technology, including digital and [inaudible], we have been differentiated in our ability to sustain our performance on those contracts and create the value we need to elevate the margins. I think first it's not a matter of if but when we'll hit and exceed this 25% EBITDA. We have been doing it. We have been delivering over 30% recently. The market condition as we foresee for -- going forward, as I've commented earlier, favorable with the right basin and operating environment mix that is favorable to our margin mix. Our technology adoption, performance through integration and digital operation, and accretive digital mix, I think, are putting the condition before pricing kicks in to give us the outlook, a positive outlook on this so that we will indeed ambition to achieve this before 5 years, clearly. Some of the performance to-date, okay, pulling and elevating the performance of our Divisions to their highest level in 3 years or more and restoring to portfolio high-grading North America already proved that we can move our margins through execution, through performance, through high-grading visibly. So can we move forward? I think pricing will only accelerate the time by which this will be met. But we are still constructive that we will achieve this independently of pricing and that pricing will come as a bonus to elevate beyond 25%. I think it would be difficult to give you a precise outlook because this will depend on every division and almost on every geography, depending on a mix outlook we foresee. But suffice to say that I think our operating leverage will indeed be a base for margin expansion to the way we execute with efficiency using our own digital transformation to execute and extract performance from our execution. So that's the base. Above that, I will place the technology first and technology mix adoption from Fit-For-Basin that are highly differentiated and successful in all basins. I will include the Transition Technologies that are starting to emerge as a unique differentiator. And it will include also the integration delivery performance in integration contract. And then indeed, and you are correct, our digital expansion will be favorable on top. So I think you have these 3 things, but I don't want to be starting to be trying to create a boundary between these, I don't think is appropriate. And I think it will depend on every basin and every division will have a different trajectory, but we are confident that across the profile we have considering the international mix, considering the offshore, considering the technology adoption that is coming back, I think this -- we have the path forward. Gas is there \u2013for a long time as a critical supply, as a transition fuel as well. So I think you see that the existing reserves, be it on unconventional or conventional, offshore and onshore will be commercialized by our customers as long as they have a path to market through LNG or they have a path to market to pipeline. So we see this accelerating. You have seen some of the critical announcement we made this morning relating to onshore, offshore, \u2013unconventional, and conventional gas developments and we see it as a trend that is not about to stop. Now, will it accelerate? I think the gas supply/demand is misbalanced this year, will recover a little bit next year, but will continue its strong trajectory going forward. And there are few countries that are committed to accelerate their gas transition. India is the most visible one, that will step change their consumption of gas and will then participate to fuel the gas demand and will itself expand in gas supply as well domestically. So Middle East, domestic gas, India as an engine of growth for gas beyond the current mix and some specific security supply that will trigger some gas development from existing gas, the redevelopment or short-cycle activity. So I'm optimistic, hence, very, very pleased with the gas contract we have been winning this quarter. It's too early to give a specific guidance for exploration. What I will say for exploration is that we are seeing 2 things coming back. We are seeing some seismic activity coming back, including there are some proof that the seismic boat utilization is going. But what is more critical is the near-field exploration is triggering more activity in exploration going forward as everybody wants to get better return on their existing infrastructure to create tieback. And hence, we have seen some licensing rounds as well. So licensing rounds, some seismic survey coming back, and exploration, near-field exploration for future infill or tieback is what we see. So to give you a magnitude directionally, it will increase, but to keep in mind it is too early. So first, we will continue to pursue. We have made investment into a digital platform. We are using it both internally and externally. We have critical customers that depend upon us and will continue to trust us for the future. So we are using it to accelerate our growth, be accretive on our growth and our returns. And whether we are getting the right value, I think it's up to you to review and give us the multiple expansion that we deserve for this. I think we have been, so far, demonstrating enough margins -- sustained margin. To this we anticipate the growth to now come to play visibly in the coming years. And I think our leadership in this is recognized. And yes, I would expect that this will be turning into a premium for valuation. I believe it's time to go. I'm not sure that we have time for another question. So thank you very much. So I would like to conclude the call and I would like to leave you with a few key takeaways. First, during the third quarter, our growth momentum was sustained, both internally, internationally and in North America and drove peer-leading margin expansion, reflecting our operating leverage, advantaged market position, and increased technology adoption. We also generated sizable free cash flow, allowing us to materially reduce our net debt. Secondly, our performance in execution, our proven integration capabilities, and our differentiated technology and digital portfolio are increasingly resonating with our customers and have resulted in sizable awards in the quarter across Middle East, offshore, and in gas development, in particular, all critical markets as the up-cycle unfolds. Thirdly, we're confident that the momentum of this up-cycle will continue allowing us to close this year with another quarter of revenue and earnings growth, resulting in full-year sequential growth internationally and pro forma North America, and full year margin expansion on the high-end of our guidance. Finally. with the backdrop of strengthening demand in the energy markets, the macro conditions are increasingly set for an exceptional multiyear growth cycle unfolding broadly during 2022, both internationally and North America and resulting in significant earnings growth potential for Schlumberger. Ladies and gentlemen, I could not be more satisfied with our strategy execution progress to-date, the enthusiasm of our entire team, and the elevated trust of our customers. I look forward to the coming quarters with increased confidence. Our returns-focused strategic execution has created the conditions for a unique outperformance in our core and digital offering at the onset of this up-cycle whilst elevating our sustainability commitment and accelerating our new energy strategic initiatives. Thank you very much."

Later there will be an opportunity for your questions and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, ND Maduemezia. Please go ahead.\nND Maduemezia: Thank you, Lea. Good morning, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being hosted from Paris, following the Schlumberger Limited Board meeting held earlier this week. Joining us on the call are Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Executive Officer; and Stephane Biguet, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind all participants that some of the statements we will be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and our other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our second-quarter press release, which is on our website. With that, I will turn the call over to Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you ND, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us on the call. In my prepared remarks today, I will cover three topics; our second-quarter results, the near-term industry macro environment and the outlook for the third quarter and the remainder of the year. Finally, I will share my perspective on how Schlumberger is positioned for sustained outperformance in this macro context. Stephane will then give more details on our financial results, and we will open the floor for questions. Our second-quarter results demonstrated very broad strength in our core portfolio as we continued to fully capitalize on the short- and long-cycle activity recovery -- across Divisions, operating environments, and geographies both in North America and internationally. The combination of revenue quality, solid execution and vastly improved operating leverage delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of margin expansion. Let me share with you some performance highlights during the quarter. Internationally, the depth and diversity of our portfolio enabled us to take hold of the recovery in the second quarter, restoring margins to pre-pandemic levels ahead of the anticipated acceleration in these markets. In North America, we achieved our double-digit margin ambition, a key milestone in our 2021 financial targets. All divisions fully leveraged the activity recovery to post sequential topline growth and significant margin expansion, including Production Systems, which reached double-digit margins during the quarter. Growth and margin expansion were led by Reservoir Performance and Well Construction, both posting growth internationally and in North America. Reservoir Performance growth was driven by the exploration and seasonal recovery, higher offshore activity and new technology adoption, all of which resulted in sequential margin expansion in excess of 370 basis points. Well Construction accelerated its rate of growth sequentially, outpacing rig count growth, both in North America and internationally, with strong contribution from offshore basins. In U.S. land, the Division grew more than 30%, double the sequential rig count growth rate over the quarter. This does not only reflect enhanced market participation, but also improving revenue quality. And cash flow finally from operation was $1.2 billion, enabling us to begin deleveraging the balance sheet this quarter. In addition to the impact of operating leverage, there were two contributing factors to this financial outperformance. First, the offshore activity mix; and second, technology adoption. The offshore rebound in the second quarter was led by high-single-digit deep water activity growth, particularly in Brazil and also included a mid-teens growth in exploration and appraisal activity across Europe and the Middle East. These market conditions presented a favorable mix and resulted in higher revenue quality for both Reservoir Performance and Well Construction. In addition, as customers commit to future offshore development activity, we received significant deep water awards for our OneSubsea business line, resulting in a doubling of the booking volume versus the prior quarter and a year-to-date book-to-bill ratio exceeding 1.5. The other contributing factor is increasing new technology uptake. The rate of adoption of our latest-generation technology increased by one-third during the quarter and included, in particular, Transition Technologies, digital and fit-for-basin solutions, which benefited all Divisions and most basins. This is a clear recognition of the performance impact our technologies generate for our customers, and it gives us increased confidence in the contribution of technology adoption toward margin expansion in this upcycle. In addition, we continued to advance our digital and new energy strategies extending the reach of our digital platform with a number of key agreements and awards as customers forge ahead with their digital transformations. And in new energy, we continued to progress all of our ventures, including the recently announced strategic collaboration with Panasonic North America to develop our new battery-grade lithium production process in Clayton Valley, Nevada. Finally, during the second quarter, we announced our commitment to achieve net-zero greenhouse emissions by 2050. I'm very proud to lead the first service company that has set net-zero ambition that includes Scope 3 emissions. We have laid out an approach to climate change that is science-based, aligned with the 1.5 degrees Celsius target of the Paris Agreement, and is it built on a comprehensive near-term road map to achieve our goal -- with interim milestones in 2025 and 2030. As a company that prides itself on technology innovation, we aim to net the balance of emissions we produce in 2050 with carbon-negative actions. This plan also includes the launch of our Transition Technologies portfolio to support our customers on their journeys to net zero, such as the avoidance of flaring with Ora wireline technology and the track record [ph] of CYNARA CO2 membrane separation technology, as you have seen in this morning's release. Our net-zero ambition and the launch of Transition Technologies is an opportunity to contribute to the decarbonization of the industry, building through innovation, a resilient future that delivers higher value and lower carbon. Overall, I'm very pleased with our revenue quality, solid execution, enhanced market participation -- both in North America and internationally -- and most importantly the translation of all of these elements into another successive quarter of margin expansion. I want to thank here the entire Schlumberger team as they continue to execute and deliver outstanding performance for our customers and our communities despite COVID impact in several parts of the world. Next, I would like to share my view on the macroeconomic environment supporting our industry. While the rise of the COVID-19 Delta variant and resurgence of related disruptions could impact the pace of economic reopening, recent market projections continue to affirm an improving global economic outlook. Global GDP growth is now expected to approach 6% in 2021 and more than 4% in 2022, which will continue to drive a progressive recovery of oil demand. This outlook is supported by recent oil demand updates, which reflect the anticipation of wider vaccine-enabled recovery, improved mobility, and additional fiscal stimulus in large economies through the second half of the year. Looking farther out, the IEA projects that global oil demand will reach 100 million barrels per day and surpass pre-COVID levels by the end of 2022 in the absence of further policy change. If oil price are at elevated levels, the supply response to this demand recovery is developing broadly as anticipated. Indeed, this combination has resulted in a call on short-cycle production as well as an uptick in long-cycle projects reflected in new FIDs and encouraging recovery in both offshore developments and near-field exploration activity through the second quarter. In North America, this supply response is reflected in the rig count and frac fleet trends, with sustained strong growth through the first half of the year. Private operators led activity growth which resulted from the acceleration of DUC completions and increased drilling activity to replenish DUC inventory. By contrast, the embrace of capital discipline by the public operators is highlighted by the rig count still being significantly below the Q1 2020 total, despite WTI prices exceeding pre-pandemic levels. In this context, despite a solid activity growth outlook, we maintain our view that the North American market will be structurally smaller than in previous cycles as a consequence of capital discipline and industry consolidation. Moving to international markets, the deficit in investment needed to deliver the required oil supply represents a sustained growth opportunity, particularly in the low-cost, advantaged basins. We remain constructive on the structural pull on international supply and the resulting activity impact. This was already visible in the second quarter with a strong seasonal rebound and offshore recovery despite the impact of COVID disruptions in parts of Asia and in the Middle East. This also marked the second consecutive quarter of international rig count growth. Looking further out, we see favorable conditions for durable investment growth driven by the combination of actions by NOCs, internationally focused investment by public E&P operators and the expectation of continued supply discipline by OPEC+, all in response to the steady evolution of demand. The current pace of international tendering contract awards and increasing book-to-bill ratio support this view. Against this backdrop, Schlumberger is extremely well-positioned -- both in the international markets and in North America. Our market exposure is biased to accretive growth -- and with a series of new contract wins, our leading digital and fit-for-basin technology portfolio, and our performance strategy, we will create value for our customers and deliver industry-leading returns. Turning to the third quarter outlook, in North America, we see another quarter of growth, albeit somewhat moderating in U.S. land, led by private operators and horizontal oil drilling and a seasonal recovery in Canada. North America offshore will remain resilient, albeit with the hurricane season in view. Moving to the international markets, positive growth momentum is expected to continue through the third quarter across all areas. Short-cycle activity will be augmented by longer-cycle project startups. In this context, directionally, we expect our global third quarter revenue to grow by mid-single digits led by Reservoir Performance and Well Construction Divisions, while our pretax segment operating margins should further expand by 50 to 100 basis points. With this outlook for the third quarter, we remain confident in achieving double-digit international growth in the second half of 2021 when compared to the second half of 2020. As a consequence, and absent further COVID setback in operational recovery, we now foresee full year revenue growth both internationally and in North America, when excluding the impact of divestitures With activity recovery ahead of us through the third quarter and strong signals of a durable recovery beyond that, we can now clearly see a path to the high end of our full year EBITDA margin expansion guidance for 2021. Looking farther ahead, the fundamentals remain very favorable, with a growing economic rebound, supportive oil prices and a demand and supply outlook all representing a set of unique conditions that will support an exceptional growth cycle. Furthermore, this cycle will be broad-based across geographies and operational environments, land, offshore, North America and particularly, international markets. The second quarter was a strong indication of the future outlook and a testament of our restored earnings power under these conditions. In summary, I'm very pleased with our strong second quarter results across our entire portfolio, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our strategy in delivering our long-term financial ambition. I will now pass the call to Stephane.\nStephane Biguet: Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Second quarter earnings per share was $0.30. This represents an increase of $0.09 compared to the first quarter of this year, and an increase of $0.25 when compared to the same period of last year, excluding charges. There were no charges or credits recorded during the first or second quarters of 2021. Overall, our second quarter revenue of $5.6 billion, increased 8% sequentially. North America revenue increased 11% sequentially, while international revenue increased 7%, both outpacing respective rig count growth. Pretax operating margins were 14.3% and have now increased four quarters in a row. This represents the highest margin since the fourth quarter of 2015. Notably, margins expanded sequentially across all four Divisions. This performance was driven not only by the seasonal rebound in the Northern Hemisphere, but also a favorable revenue mix as a result of increased offshore activity, new technology adoption and increased exploration and appraisal activity. Company-wide, adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.3% for the second quarter increased 118 basis points sequentially and is the highest since the third quarter of 2018. I am very pleased with this margin performance, which reflects the benefit of significant operating leverage we have created through the combination of the high-grading of our portfolio and our cost reduction program. This performance also gives me the confidence that we will continue to increase margins in the third quarter and beyond. Let me now go through the second-quarter results for each Division. Second quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $817 million, increased 6% sequentially, while pretax operating margins increased 147 basis points to 33%. These increases were primarily driven by strong digital solution sales. Reservoir Performance revenue of $1.1 billion increased 12% sequentially. This revenue growth was entirely driven by higher international activity, which resulted in international revenue increasing by 13%. Margins expanded 373 basis points to 13.9%, largely due to the seasonal recovery in the Northern Hemisphere and increased offshore and exploration activity as well as favorable technology mix in the Middle East and Africa. Well Construction revenue of $2.1 billion increased 9% sequentially, while margins increased 209 basis points to 12.9%. These improvements were driven by strong performance both in North America and internationally. U.S. land revenue grew by over 30%, significantly outpacing the increase in rig count. International activity increased beyond the seasonal rebound as many countries experienced double-digit revenue growth. Finally, Production Systems' revenue of $1.7 billion increased 6% sequentially, and margins increased 146 basis points to 10.2%. These increases were primarily driven by higher activity in Europe, Africa and North America. Now turning to our liquidity, during the quarter, we generated $1.2 billion of cash flow from operations, and positive free cash flow of $869 million despite severance payments of $72 million. The amounts included a receipt of $477 million U.S. federal tax refund relating to prior years. This refund helped support our deleveraging efforts during the quarter. In this regard, our gross debt decreased by $861 million during the quarter. We have begun to execute on our commitment to deleverage, as demonstrated by the early redemption in June of all $665 million of notes that were coming due in September. We also repaid $236 million of commercial paper during the quarter. Net debt decreased sequentially by $632 million to $13 billion, the lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2017. During the quarter, we made capital investments of $351 million. This amount includes CapEx, investments in APS projects and multi-client. For the full year of 2021, we are still expecting to spend between $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion on capital investments. In total, during the first half of 2021, we generated over $1.6 billion of cash flow from operations and over $1 billion of free cash flow. These amounts are fully expected to increase in the second half of the year, consistent with historical trends. As a result, we remain confident in our ability to achieve double-digit free cash flow margin for the full year of 2021 and beyond. This will allow us to continue to deleverage the balance sheet and provide us with flexibility in our capital allocation. One last item worth highlighting is that during the quarter, we replaced our EUR750 million credit facility with a new three-year EUR 750 million sustainability-linked revolving credit facility. The terms of this facility are aligned with the interim emissions reduction targets disclosed as part of our net-zero emissions commitment announced this quarter. This is a first for Schlumberger and further demonstrates our commitment to fully participate in the decarbonization of the industry. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Stephane. I think we are ready to open the floor for questions. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nJames C. West: Hey, good afternoon, Olivier and Stephane.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Good morning, James.\nJames C. West: So Olivier, really strong performance and execution in the second quarter, kind of across the board and really strong margin performance, I thought. What's the sustainability of this type of margin improvement as we go through the back half of this year, and in particular, probably out in 2022 when things really get going and the cycle really takes off?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yes. Thanks, James. You are correct. I think we are very proud of this margin expansion. I think there were several factors I will highlight first on the second quarter and then project how we believe we have sustainability of margin expansion. So first and foremost, I think the performance was led by revenue expansion, revenue growth. I think revenue growth has worked out to be at or ahead of our expectation both internationally and in North America. I think credit to our team, credit to the customer centricity, the new organization and our performance. Secondly, I think we have seen a significant effect of our operating leverage as well as operational efficiency playing in full light during the quarter, and we expect this to be the base of our margin expansion for the quarters to come. So, this was in full display in all divisions and has led to this significant margin expansion, particularly in the service-led Reservoir Performance and Well Construction. Thirdly, the revenue quality, as I recall it, was led by favorable activity mix coming from the seasonal rebound in some basins, some regions, and that included an offshore mix that was favorable to those two divisions as well as well as an exploration and appraisal uptick, mid-teens exploration and appraisal offshore quarter-on-quarter during the second quarter. So when you combine this, this is representing a revenue mix quality that I think is unique. This was supplemented by technology adoption, technology adoptions linked to our fit-for-basin solution for customers that are seeing success. Digital, as you heard during the remarks prepared by Stephane, and lately the new technology transitions -- Transition Technologies portfolio, a combination of which is creating revenue quality that is then impacting favorably our margin. Lastly and this was only noticeable in North America, we had a couple of green shoots on pricing, on Well Construction that is also starting to be recognized. So, to project this forward, I think the seasonal rebound will not always be there every quarter. The unique exploration and appraisal uptick mix that we got also will not repeat, but you can count on us to leverage the future growth in the industry, both in North America and internationally to seize the operating leverage and operating efficiency we have, the favorable mix and the technology adoption that should fuel our margin expansion going forward.\nJames C. West: Right, okay, good, it certainly provided a good glimpse into what the renewed earnings power of Schlumberger is. Perhaps if we could touch on Digital for a second, because it's kind of in a league of its own at this point. The technology adoption seems to be continuing to be strong and maybe accelerating. Margins were a little bit ahead of at least what we were expecting. What is your outlook there on the Digital side as we go through the next few quarters, especially again in 2022 and 2023?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think the progress we made this quarter was twofold. First, progress on our platform strategy. We continued to complete the platform foundations, the partnership, the enablement that give us extended market access such as what we are using from the IBM\\Red Hat technology to access hybrid clouds and unlock, if you like, about one-third of the addressable market by this hybrid cloud and in-country solution we provide. And I think we have made much progress there, and I think we are in the eighth or the ninth inning, if you like, on the platform readiness for full scalability and expansion. And we made progress on the adoption of DELFI as you have seen some announcements, and we continue to progress on rolling out for accounts that have already adopted DELFI. Hence, our revenue on the DELFI and the new technology of digital was significantly accretive to our growth, significantly accretive to D&I, and resulted into margin expansion flow-through that was visible this quarter. So that will not continue to be the same every quarter. It depends on the seasonality and on the specific, but expect directionally to continue to grow.\nJames C. West: Okay, great. Thanks for that.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, James.\nOperator: And our next question is from David Anderson with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nJ. David Anderson: Hi, good afternoon, Olivier. So clearly, we're starting to see the international upstream market starting to pick up, as you noted double-digit increases in many countries. I noticed you didn't mention Saudi, which I would expect to start to pick up in the coming months. So when do you think that piece falls into place? And how do you see the cadence for Middle East activity through the end of this year? And kind of what does that mean for '22 growth? I would think that kind of, at this point, I'd be surprised if growth wasn't up at least double digits internationally, especially with the positive commentary around offshore. Just wondering if you could comment, please.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yes. First, in short term, I would like to reiterate my positive commentary on the second quarter growth. It was all basins, all divisions internationally. So, it was broad and inclusive of Middle East. Now in the context of the Middle East in particular, the growth was maybe more muted or less aggressive and less accretive to the overall growth than other basins, and there are a couple of reasons for that. And the first and foremost reason is related to the supply constraints that are still outstanding on back and as such muting some of the short-cycle activity that we could have expected to rebound faster. So now going forward, there are a couple of factors that will play favorably short term and midterm. Short term, there will be a relief of some of these supply constraints that will continue to inch up the short cycle activity including Saudi. There is a commitment in Middle East for gas development. And I think Qatar was the first to expand their commitment, and we have benefited greatly from that rebound in activity for the last couple of quarters, and this will extend also to a couple of other countries, including Saudi. And lastly, as we turn into 2022, you have heard some signals from a couple of countries in GCC that have signaled that they will commit to production capacity increase to fulfill their opportunity to gain share as there will be a pull on international supply. So this will result from 2022 in combination of short cycle gas development, and long cycle across that region. And hence, they will catch up, and they will certainly be a region that will lead the activity growth and will support in second half our double-digit year-on-year H2 and next year into a strong growth going forward. Finally, if I have to make a comment on this, I think you may have seen some contract wins and contract award in Middle East. And we believe that on top of this activity growth, we have the potential to outperform and then getting a further tailwind to our growth going forward.\nJ. David Anderson: So if we look a little bit further out, you've kind of talked big picture about EBITDA exceeding 2019 levels with only about 50% of that lost revenue coming back. Just wondering if anything has changed in that view, either in terms of the timing of that growth coming -- that revenue coming back or the EBITDA level? Has anything sort of changed in that kind of longer-term view that we're thinking about?\nOlivier Le Peuch: No. Obviously, with the results we just delivered, we are increasing our confidence in our ability to reach and expand our margin going forward as the cycle unfolds. So starting with the next two or three years, we see now a strong case for a double-digit floor as an activity growth with an upside scenario. We see that the contract wins and the market position we have will benefit us to pull from this additional growth going forward. And the operational leverage, the activity mix including offshore and the technology adoption in doing digital will all create the condition, as I commented earlier, to expand our margins. So the ambition we have set to recover the net EBITDA dollar with less than half of the -- about half of the revenue recovery, I think, are still valid. And the mid-cycle ambition to expand the margin visibly is in full play.\nJ. David Anderson: Okay, thank you, Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you.\nOperator: Next we have a question from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nChase Mulvehill: Hey, good morning, everybody. I guess the first question\u2026\nOlivier Le Peuch: Hi.\nChase Mulvehill: Good morning, Olivier, first question, I just kind of wanted to ask about inflationary pressures. Obviously, supply chain seems to be tightening across the industry. We hear about raw material cost inflation. So maybe if you could just take a moment and talk about your ability to kind of control the supply chain and control cost or either pass along cost on the OFS side and also on the Cameron side as well.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Now it's a very valid question, and it's something that we observe, and some facts and some trends that has materialized in some index -- indices going up. But I believe that the toolbox we have, and professional and very expanse organization we have in our planning and supply chain and manufacturing organization that are used to manage some inflationary pressure has allowed us to mitigate and hedge at this inflationary pressure and contain cost inflation into -- under our rules. Now when and as this happens and on the specifics of logistics or specific material, we are engaging with our customers using the contract terms we have, to leverage an adjustment, and we have done so successfully with several customers. So we are confident that the combination of our supply chain capability with global and local leverage and the customer-centricity engagement approach we have, ability to sit and discuss the commercial terms give us the ability to support this and continue to drive forward and expand our margins.\nChase Mulvehill: Awesome. And a quick follow-up here, probably for Stephane. When we think about free cash flow, obviously, it's going to be accelerating as you get into 2022. You'll be doing deleveraging, as you talked about, paying down some debt. But at what point should we think about incremental cash coming back to shareholders, probably a dividend bump first, and then maybe buybacks. But is there a certain leverage ratio that we should be looking at or thinking about you guys targeting before you kind of think about increasing it?\nStephane Biguet: Yes, yes, Chase, we do have a target leverage ratio at this stage. It is going down to less than 2 times net debt-to-EBITDA. Now with our strong cash flow performance and the EBITDA expansion, we are quite confident that we can achieve this target sometime by the end of 2022. Now we will, of course, need to continue investing in our core business to fully reap the benefits of this growth cycle, but this will be done with the same discipline we are exercising today and within the target range of 5% to 7% for the operating part of our CapEx, i.e., excluding APS and multi-client. Accounting for this, however, we will still generate significant excess cash flow throughout the growth cycle. This is, of course, very good news. It gives us optionality in our capital allocation, particularly to execute our strategy and to fund our new horizons of growth. Now whether it relates to our core portfolio or expansion into digital or new energy, any new investment will be looked at under the strict lens of our return-based capital allocation framework. Beyond that, indeed, we will continue to review our shareholder distribution policy based on the sustainability of cash flows and potential exceptional cash inflows, for example, proceeds from divestiture. So this is where we will take it.\nChase Mulvehill: Perfect. I'll turn it back over. Thanks everybody.\nOperator: And our next question is from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nScott Gruber: Yes. Good afternoon. Great quarter.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Scott.\nScott Gruber: So just as a clarification question to start, the 10% free cash conversion rate relative to revenues, we should be including the tax refund when we think about the conversion rate for the full year. Is that correct, Stephane?\nStephane Biguet: Yes, you should actually. But you have a few offsets, and not necessarily in the same quarter, but we continue to pay severance payments. I'm talking about offsets to the tax refund, Scott. So we continue to pay severance payments with the tail end. The process is finished, but there are still payments coming. So when you put all of it together, the tax refund is not fully a plus. Now excluding the two exceptional items going opposite way, tax refund and severance, we can actually still generate the 10% plus free cash flow margin. So we should be exceeding now that we have the tax refund for sure.\nScott Gruber: Yes. Got you. And then I was actually surprised to see the Well Construction share gains in the U.S., it's super impressive. Was that kind of a onetime catch-up just with high oil prices, customers now willing to pay up for your technology? Or do you see continued share gain potential onshore, whether it's Well Construction or elsewhere, even in light of private really driving the growth? Are you seeing gains with private? Just some color on U.S. share gain potential would be great.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Absolutely, Scott, we are very proud of this achievement, and let me give you the three drivers for it, in terms of top line growth. First and foremost, performance in the way we execute, and I think has led to -- from cementing to drilling, directional drilling or bits market share gain with both private and with operators, public operators in the U.S. The second factor is that, as you remember, as part of our North America strategy pivot that we did initiate two years ago, we accelerated our technology access, giving access of fit-for-basin technology to some local DD company that are then using, renting or buying our equipment and using it to serve their local customers, mostly, if not exclusively, private. So this has been going quarter-on-quarter, and this is helping us to reach market and expand our market share beyond what we could do to our service arm. And finally, as I mentioned in one of my response earlier, we had some green shoots where our performance was in high demand, our directional drilling equipment was seen as unique to deliver the curve. Hence, we could extract some pricing premium. So the combination of these three have delivered this 30% plus quarter-on-quarter top line delivery, far outpacing the rig count growth. So there are some exceptional, as always, but I would expect that the dynamic and directionally this to continue going forward, particularly the market share gain.\nScott Gruber: Very impressive. Good to hear. Thanks for the color.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Scott.\nOperator: Next, we go to Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nConnor Lynagh: Yes, thanks. I wanted to ask about labor. Obviously, you had to take the challenging decision to reduce your workforce dramatically last year. I'm curious as we now look back towards growth, how well positioned are you to capitalize on the market demand? Do you have excess labor? Do you need to hire substantially? And I'm particularly curious in international regions where you may have some more long-cycle constraints on that.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yes, it's a very good question. It's something that we're working out to continue to make progress. But I think in a nutshell, I think the step change we did in some of the operational environment, our operational practice, including digital operation, has given us the opportunity to respond on the first peak of this cycle without deploying the same resource set as we have in the past, hence, getting direct efficiency gain as we mobilize and grow with the cycle. Going forward, and already initiated in some geographies where we had more than double-digit growth, as I mentioned, we had access to some resource that we onboarded during the quarter to respond to the contract we are winning. So the long cycle actually nature of international give us a bit more long-term visibility to this condition. Hence, our market approach is to target specific geographies and business line where we believe we can be generating accretive returns and growth and prepare for it by mobilizing ahead the resource or moving resource to address those. So I think we have a global access to talent. We are using a lot and at scale this remote operation. So it is a challenge for us to respond to high demand, but we believe that we have the operational environment to make it a success.\nConnor Lynagh: Thank you. That's helpful context. Sort of a similar question, but on the steel or equipment side of things, basically, I'm wondering if you could, based on your expectations for how much activity will grow over the next, call it, 6 to 12 months, as you look in some of the more differentiated markets and more consolidated supplier markets, call it Middle East, offshore, et cetera, do you feel that there is adequate equipment to meet continued growth beyond that point? Do you feel the capacity will be tightening significantly? Just appreciate an update there. Thanks.\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think in the early part of the cycle, I think we will use and the industry will use the excess supply that came from the compression of activity that came for the last two years. But again, we have very much professionalized our planning and supply organization. And I think from the Cameron to the asset that we have to deploy, I think we are trying to take a long-term view and scenario-based view on the future, looking beyond the 12-month horizon, and I'm starting to prepare and put some options so that we can respond to this growth going forward. Early part will not necessarily create a tightness, but the mid-cycle for sure, before the mid-cycle, this will create the condition for tightening supply and hence, some pricing conditions.\nConnor Lynagh: Thank you. I will turn it back.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you.\nOperator: Next we go to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNeil Mehta: Good morning, team. The first question is around portfolio optimization. Perhaps you guys can weigh in on how you're thinking about the path for asset monetization, thinking Canada, maybe the Middle East? What are the opportunities? And how large could the asset sale market be for Schlumberger?\nStephane Biguet: So look, Neil, hi, we -- as it relates to the divestitures we disclosed last quarter, first, the APS asset in Canada, it's -- both are progressing as planned by the way. So in Canada, we have more than 10 parties actively looking at the information in our data room, and we plan to receive first round offers by the end of next month. Good news is that the economics keep on improving. So we are hopeful we can achieve a successful transaction. The Middle East rigs, likewise, progressing. We are negotiating with the shortlisted bidders. We have completed their due diligence, and it's going as planned. So I think really, these are the two divestitures that we have over equity positions where we have options for monetization in the future such as our Liberty stake, but this is something we will -- the timing and the magnitude we'll look at in due time.\nNeil Mehta: Yes. Great. And then I would appreciate some of the comments you made on Saudi broadly, but maybe you could just step back and talk about OPEC+, including other regions within that cartel or in the plus side of OPEC. How are you seeing activity trends here? And what role do you think Schlumberger is going to play in terms of building out capacity that they are talking about?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think, first, we have, I'll say, a privileged market position with most of the NOCs in this OPEC+ consortium. We have seen across the broad spectrum of these NOCs' activity starting to build back, seasonal rebounds playing strongly in Russia. And we expect, as I said, this short cycle to recover for the next two to four quarters as the demand will be lifted, as the constraints will be lifted, and we see that more than one or two country will actually commit to this capacity expansion. And we have the footprint. We have the relationship. We have the fit-for-basin to leverage and then to respond to this capacity buildup and this growth opportunity in those, from Russia to Middle East, particularly. So I feel confident that these market share pursuits, that as the market comes back from '22, '23 will be giving us an opportunity to leverage our market position and move up.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you.\nOperator: Next we go to Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan Chase. Please go ahead.\nArun Jayaram: Yeah, good morning. Maybe just to follow-up to Neil's question on NOCs, I guess you're seeing some positive activity trends from the NOCs. And would you characterize these activities thus far as just more regarding sustaining capital requirements? Or are you seeing any potential mix shift in terms of increasing productive capacity? And again, we did note some increases, I guess, on the exploration side in terms of your revenue base.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yes, I think as I commented before, we have to distinguish first the gas and the oil market. And on gas market, I think the activity has been more sustained, and as seen in Qatar, a significant commitment to accelerate the North field redevelopment and expansion. So that has been very positive, and we have the benefit of that exposure. And the gas remained steady and supported elsewhere. On oil, you have a mix. But in short term, it's mostly a short cycle in anticipation of the supply constraints relief. And for two or three of the country that participate to the GCC, they have already made public commitments that they will expand, and they will participate at scale into the post rebalance, if you like, of the supply and then participate to the capture of international share of supply into 2023. So that will mean plan that will materialize from planning, from contract and from execution into 2022.\nArun Jayaram: Great, great. Olivier, you recently provided some longer-term outlook comments for new energy citing, call it, the 10% kind of growth CAGR as you helped your clients decarbonize. I was wondering if you could give us some thoughts on maybe the baseline for that long-term forecast and areas of your Transition Technologies portfolio that you're seeing perhaps the greatest traction as we sit here today.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yes. Let me first clarify, and not mix in the same umbrella, the New Energy portfolio that we have developed with the purpose to create a new chapter beyond oil and gas to participate at scale to the energy transition from hydrogen to CCS and geo energy or lithium, as you have heard, from the Transition Technologies that we believe are very pertinent to the decarbonization of our oil and gas industry, helping our customers to reduce their footprint, CO2 footprint, to reduce their GHG emission. And in this context, we are focusing on flaring elimination or reduction, and you are using, in particular, the Ora wireline technology to avoid returning the fluids to the surface and burn and dispose through flaring and do the reservoir characterization and testing in situ, if you like. And that's a unique technology that has significant impact on both efficiency and on the CO2 footprint for everyone using it. And we are looking at methane emission detection and containment. And we are looking at, as you have seen in the press release this morning, also the CYNARA CO2 membrane that have superior performance for large acid gas treatment, if you want, to do CO2 sequestration and capture. So you have these two aspects. So the Transition Technologies will come more and more into play. And most of the customer I meet are asking us whether we can help them and have a conversation engagement on to methane detection, flaring or other techniques that eliminate or reduce significantly the footprint of CO2 on every operation on their Scope 3 upstream, if you like, in addition to their Scope 1 direct emission. And then -- and that will be part of our technology growth, technology adoption in the quarters to come. And then longer term, we will build on our New Energy portfolio that we are building. And then once we have -- continue to build this, we will grow at scale from hydrogen to CCS and [geo-energy] (ph) with Celsius for the heating and cooling of buildings to lithium production is the pilot that we are initiating, and the contribution from Panasonic give us the opportunity to do so. So these are two different avenue for growth short term and long term.\nArun Jayaram: Thanks for the fulsome answer. Appreciate it.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you.\nOperator: Next we go to Tommy Moll with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nTommy Moll: Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions.\nStephane Biguet: Good morning.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Good morning Tommy.\nTommy Moll: I wanted to start on your Digital & Integration margin. Your second -- your incremental this quarter was notably higher versus the trend and an impressive one at that. Fair to say that the full year for 2021 ought to be shaping up above the 30% type of range that we talked about last quarter. And then as you look beyond, is there any kind of through-cycle or normalized way you would frame the incremental margin opportunity for us there? Thank you.\nStephane Biguet: So look, Tommy, yes, it is shaping up to be slightly above the 30%. At this level, we are happy anyway with 30% in Q2. There is a bit of seasonality actually on software and maintenance sales, which are lower in Q1. So it's kind of normal to see a nice uptick between Q1 and Q2. So -- however, throughout the year on a full year basis, yes, we'll be a bit above 30% now. This is the kind of margins, which throughout the cycle, this is a fixed cost business. So as we accelerate the deployment of our digital solutions and the adoption improves, we could see margins increasing from there. So it's quite a healthy business, and this is why we are focusing on it basically.\nTommy Moll: Thank you. That's helpful. And I wanted to follow up with a big picture question on your New Energy strategy. If you think about from a strategic standpoint, you're the largest service -- you're the largest platform globally with the oil and gas incumbents. What if any, advantages does that confer on you vis-\u00e0-vis some of the smaller pure plays attacking some of these markets, the scale and the customer relationships that you have? And then if you also think about the other side of the equation where their cost of capital may, in fact, be much lower than yours, so you potentially have a different algorithm by which you decide how to allocate capital across these opportunities. So how do you think about when to put capital to work versus when the ask may be a little bit too rich and you're going to preserve your dry powder for another opportunity? Thanks.\nOlivier Le Peuch: A very good question. I think first and foremost, I think let me highlight the, I think, two different, I would say, factor that will indeed leverage our current platform. First is the global deployment capability we have. We can industrialize and ship technology and deploy technology anywhere in the world, and we have done so for more than 80 or 90 years. And I think our ability to create franchise in every country from technology developed centrally or we develop locally, I think, is something that is unique, and I think that differentiates from many of the pure plays. The relationship we have and the customer base we have today will be occasionally, and I think will be the sense of the CCS where our customers have the opportunity to participate or in some of the downstream operation where they have a carbon capture or blue hydrogen opportunity could be an opportunity for us to continue to work with that customer base and expand. And at the same time, some of this company are turning into integrated energy company that will also participate at scale in the same market as we do. So that relationship will be useful, but I will more, I would say, highlight the global deployment capability. Now when it comes to capital allocation and capital deployment, I think it's very difficult to pinpoint too specific here. I think we will look again continue to mature this venture, prepare for scale as we start to, I would say, progress on our milestones, progress on our partnership and progress on the business model and the supply chain model that are quite different from the one we experience today. And then in that context, we'll make the appropriate capital allocation decision to be accretive to our long-term growth and to our returns.\nTommy Moll: Thank you. I appreciate it and I turn it back.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, our final question comes from Marc Bianchi with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nMarc Bianchit: Thank you. Olivier, you mentioned the return to 100 million barrels of consumption and sort of a share shift from North America to international where the oil is coming from. I'm curious if you think that the international activity needs to surpass 2019 levels to deliver that much oil and what you think the time line is to get there.\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think in short term, the rebalance will be mostly down to the release of the spare capacity that, I think, exists. Now if you look at the current production of the U.S., which is 1.5 million barrels or about below -- in U.S. land -- below what it was in early 2020, this gap has not yet been breached. And I think I do not expect this to be breached as we exit 2022. So there will be an increment of oil supply that we will pull on international market that the market can deliver today. But for sustainability in '23 and '24, the market will have to commit capacity. Hence, this is the reason why in Middle East and other country, you see this commitment of capacity. And this is the reason why you see the return of offshore and the commitment of FID. We have 50 FID about already to date. We expect to be 100 FID, most of them in offshore at the end of the year. This is 50% more than it was last year, and the trajectory is towards 150 -- another 50% increment after that. So now going forward and expanding beyond, I would expect within the next two to three years, obviously, with this dynamic and the pull on the international supply will create the floor of activity to reach and/or exceed the level of 2019 activity within that time frame.\nMarc Bianchit: Okay. Great. Very helpful. Separately, on -- you mentioned APS a couple of times in the press release. It sounds like maybe activity has ramped a bit in Canada, where you have a bit more oil price exposure. I'm just curious how investors should think about the sensitivity to oil price from APS at this point. And then if you do have a successful transaction and sell the business, just how material of a shortfall in cash flow would that create just vis-\u00e0-vis what we're seeing right now?\nStephane Biguet: I'll take these questions. So look, the -- actually, the activity itself didn't really change, and activity here is more measured in terms of production, of course. So we did have a bit of a nice windfall on increased WTI in the second quarter from our Canada asset, but it's -- in the grand scheme of things, it's not material. In Ecuador, by the way, at this level of WTI, our tariffs are either fixed or when they are variable, they are capped. And we have passed that cap. So there is little sensitivity to oil price at this level besides Canada. Now it makes it a very good time to actually monetize our assets, right? It's -- it has generated cash flow lately because of the oil price and the investment level we put in there. Historically, it's an asset that requires quite a bit of CapEx. And so when we close the transaction, we shouldn't see a big impact on our cash flow, and we'll get, of course, hopefully, very good proceeds from the transaction.\nMarc Bianchit: Wonderful. Thank you very much.\nStephane Biguet: Thank you.\nOperator: Speakers I'll turn the conference back over to you for closing remarks.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you very much. So to conclude the call, I would like to leave you with a few key takeaways. First, the second quarter results clearly demonstrate both the strength of our market position -- particularly internationally, with sequential growth in all Divisions and Basins -- and our significant operating leverage, resulting in more than 200 basis points of operating margin expansion internationally with all Divisions contributing significant fall-through. Second, the activity and customer trends observed during the quarter reinforce our conviction in an increasingly favorable outlook with a broad recovery across all basins and operating environments and with a much improved contribution from new technology adoption. Third, and absent further COVID setbacks impacting activity or economic rebounds, we are confident that the momentum for this upcycle -- both North America and internationally, will continue during the second half of 2021 and will lead to another quarter of growth and margin expansion. As a consequence, we remain confident in our second half guidance shared previously for international growth and have increased our confidence in our full year margin expansion and cash flow generation. Finally, as we look further ahead, the conditions are set for an exceptional growth cycle in response to the call for supply in 2022 and future demand growth in subsequent years. This will increasingly favor international supply impacting land and offshore, short and long cycle globally. Ladies and gentlemen, our returns-focused strategy, international footprint, digital, decarbonization, and new energy strategic initiatives are highly differentiated, and we support our outperformance ambition throughout the cycle and beyond as we continue to write a new chapter for the company. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Second quarter earnings per share was $0.30. This represents an increase of $0.09 compared to the first quarter of this year, and an increase of $0.25 when compared to the same period of last year, excluding charges. There were no charges or credits recorded during the first or second quarters of 2021. Overall, our second quarter revenue of $5.6 billion, increased 8% sequentially. North America revenue increased 11% sequentially, while international revenue increased 7%, both outpacing respective rig count growth. Pretax operating margins were 14.3% and have now increased four quarters in a row. This represents the highest margin since the fourth quarter of 2015. Notably, margins expanded sequentially across all four Divisions. This performance was driven not only by the seasonal rebound in the Northern Hemisphere, but also a favorable revenue mix as a result of increased offshore activity, new technology adoption and increased exploration and appraisal activity. Company-wide, adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.3% for the second quarter increased 118 basis points sequentially and is the highest since the third quarter of 2018. I am very pleased with this margin performance, which reflects the benefit of significant operating leverage we have created through the combination of the high-grading of our portfolio and our cost reduction program. This performance also gives me the confidence that we will continue to increase margins in the third quarter and beyond. Let me now go through the second-quarter results for each Division. Second quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $817 million, increased 6% sequentially, while pretax operating margins increased 147 basis points to 33%. These increases were primarily driven by strong digital solution sales. Reservoir Performance revenue of $1.1 billion increased 12% sequentially. This revenue growth was entirely driven by higher international activity, which resulted in international revenue increasing by 13%. Margins expanded 373 basis points to 13.9%, largely due to the seasonal recovery in the Northern Hemisphere and increased offshore and exploration activity as well as favorable technology mix in the Middle East and Africa. Well Construction revenue of $2.1 billion increased 9% sequentially, while margins increased 209 basis points to 12.9%. These improvements were driven by strong performance both in North America and internationally. U.S. land revenue grew by over 30%, significantly outpacing the increase in rig count. International activity increased beyond the seasonal rebound as many countries experienced double-digit revenue growth. Finally, Production Systems' revenue of $1.7 billion increased 6% sequentially, and margins increased 146 basis points to 10.2%. These increases were primarily driven by higher activity in Europe, Africa and North America. Now turning to our liquidity, during the quarter, we generated $1.2 billion of cash flow from operations, and positive free cash flow of $869 million despite severance payments of $72 million. The amounts included a receipt of $477 million U.S. federal tax refund relating to prior years. This refund helped support our deleveraging efforts during the quarter. In this regard, our gross debt decreased by $861 million during the quarter. We have begun to execute on our commitment to deleverage, as demonstrated by the early redemption in June of all $665 million of notes that were coming due in September. We also repaid $236 million of commercial paper during the quarter. Net debt decreased sequentially by $632 million to $13 billion, the lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2017. During the quarter, we made capital investments of $351 million. This amount includes CapEx, investments in APS projects and multi-client. For the full year of 2021, we are still expecting to spend between $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion on capital investments. In total, during the first half of 2021, we generated over $1.6 billion of cash flow from operations and over $1 billion of free cash flow. These amounts are fully expected to increase in the second half of the year, consistent with historical trends. As a result, we remain confident in our ability to achieve double-digit free cash flow margin for the full year of 2021 and beyond. This will allow us to continue to deleverage the balance sheet and provide us with flexibility in our capital allocation. One last item worth highlighting is that during the quarter, we replaced our EUR750 million credit facility with a new three-year EUR 750 million sustainability-linked revolving credit facility. The terms of this facility are aligned with the interim emissions reduction targets disclosed as part of our net-zero emissions commitment announced this quarter. This is a first for Schlumberger and further demonstrates our commitment to fully participate in the decarbonization of the industry. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier. Yes, yes, Chase, we do have a target leverage ratio at this stage. It is going down to less than 2 times net debt-to-EBITDA. Now with our strong cash flow performance and the EBITDA expansion, we are quite confident that we can achieve this target sometime by the end of 2022. Now we will, of course, need to continue investing in our core business to fully reap the benefits of this growth cycle, but this will be done with the same discipline we are exercising today and within the target range of 5% to 7% for the operating part of our CapEx, i.e., excluding APS and multi-client. Accounting for this, however, we will still generate significant excess cash flow throughout the growth cycle. This is, of course, very good news. It gives us optionality in our capital allocation, particularly to execute our strategy and to fund our new horizons of growth. Now whether it relates to our core portfolio or expansion into digital or new energy, any new investment will be looked at under the strict lens of our return-based capital allocation framework. Beyond that, indeed, we will continue to review our shareholder distribution policy based on the sustainability of cash flows and potential exceptional cash inflows, for example, proceeds from divestiture. So this is where we will take it. Yes, you should actually. But you have a few offsets, and not necessarily in the same quarter, but we continue to pay severance payments. I'm talking about offsets to the tax refund, Scott. So we continue to pay severance payments with the tail end. The process is finished, but there are still payments coming. So when you put all of it together, the tax refund is not fully a plus. Now excluding the two exceptional items going opposite way, tax refund and severance, we can actually still generate the 10% plus free cash flow margin. So we should be exceeding now that we have the tax refund for sure. So look, Neil, hi, we -- as it relates to the divestitures we disclosed last quarter, first, the APS asset in Canada, it's -- both are progressing as planned by the way. So in Canada, we have more than 10 parties actively looking at the information in our data room, and we plan to receive first round offers by the end of next month. Good news is that the economics keep on improving. So we are hopeful we can achieve a successful transaction. The Middle East rigs, likewise, progressing. We are negotiating with the shortlisted bidders. We have completed their due diligence, and it's going as planned. So I think really, these are the two divestitures that we have over equity positions where we have options for monetization in the future such as our Liberty stake, but this is something we will -- the timing and the magnitude we'll look at in due time. Good morning. So look, Tommy, yes, it is shaping up to be slightly above the 30%. At this level, we are happy anyway with 30% in Q2. There is a bit of seasonality actually on software and maintenance sales, which are lower in Q1. So it's kind of normal to see a nice uptick between Q1 and Q2. So -- however, throughout the year on a full year basis, yes, we'll be a bit above 30% now. This is the kind of margins, which throughout the cycle, this is a fixed cost business. So as we accelerate the deployment of our digital solutions and the adoption improves, we could see margins increasing from there. So it's quite a healthy business, and this is why we are focusing on it basically. I'll take these questions. So look, the -- actually, the activity itself didn't really change, and activity here is more measured in terms of production, of course. So we did have a bit of a nice windfall on increased WTI in the second quarter from our Canada asset, but it's -- in the grand scheme of things, it's not material. In Ecuador, by the way, at this level of WTI, our tariffs are either fixed or when they are variable, they are capped. And we have passed that cap. So there is little sensitivity to oil price at this level besides Canada. Now it makes it a very good time to actually monetize our assets, right? It's -- it has generated cash flow lately because of the oil price and the investment level we put in there. Historically, it's an asset that requires quite a bit of CapEx. And so when we close the transaction, we shouldn't see a big impact on our cash flow, and we'll get, of course, hopefully, very good proceeds from the transaction. Thank you."

            "name": "Olivier Le Peuch",
            "content": "Thank you ND, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us on the call. In my prepared remarks today, I will cover three topics; our second-quarter results, the near-term industry macro environment and the outlook for the third quarter and the remainder of the year. Finally, I will share my perspective on how Schlumberger is positioned for sustained outperformance in this macro context. Stephane will then give more details on our financial results, and we will open the floor for questions. Our second-quarter results demonstrated very broad strength in our core portfolio as we continued to fully capitalize on the short- and long-cycle activity recovery -- across Divisions, operating environments, and geographies both in North America and internationally. The combination of revenue quality, solid execution and vastly improved operating leverage delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of margin expansion. Let me share with you some performance highlights during the quarter. Internationally, the depth and diversity of our portfolio enabled us to take hold of the recovery in the second quarter, restoring margins to pre-pandemic levels ahead of the anticipated acceleration in these markets. In North America, we achieved our double-digit margin ambition, a key milestone in our 2021 financial targets. All divisions fully leveraged the activity recovery to post sequential topline growth and significant margin expansion, including Production Systems, which reached double-digit margins during the quarter. Growth and margin expansion were led by Reservoir Performance and Well Construction, both posting growth internationally and in North America. Reservoir Performance growth was driven by the exploration and seasonal recovery, higher offshore activity and new technology adoption, all of which resulted in sequential margin expansion in excess of 370 basis points. Well Construction accelerated its rate of growth sequentially, outpacing rig count growth, both in North America and internationally, with strong contribution from offshore basins. In U.S. land, the Division grew more than 30%, double the sequential rig count growth rate over the quarter. This does not only reflect enhanced market participation, but also improving revenue quality. And cash flow finally from operation was $1.2 billion, enabling us to begin deleveraging the balance sheet this quarter. In addition to the impact of operating leverage, there were two contributing factors to this financial outperformance. First, the offshore activity mix; and second, technology adoption. The offshore rebound in the second quarter was led by high-single-digit deep water activity growth, particularly in Brazil and also included a mid-teens growth in exploration and appraisal activity across Europe and the Middle East. These market conditions presented a favorable mix and resulted in higher revenue quality for both Reservoir Performance and Well Construction. In addition, as customers commit to future offshore development activity, we received significant deep water awards for our OneSubsea business line, resulting in a doubling of the booking volume versus the prior quarter and a year-to-date book-to-bill ratio exceeding 1.5. The other contributing factor is increasing new technology uptake. The rate of adoption of our latest-generation technology increased by one-third during the quarter and included, in particular, Transition Technologies, digital and fit-for-basin solutions, which benefited all Divisions and most basins. This is a clear recognition of the performance impact our technologies generate for our customers, and it gives us increased confidence in the contribution of technology adoption toward margin expansion in this upcycle. In addition, we continued to advance our digital and new energy strategies extending the reach of our digital platform with a number of key agreements and awards as customers forge ahead with their digital transformations. And in new energy, we continued to progress all of our ventures, including the recently announced strategic collaboration with Panasonic North America to develop our new battery-grade lithium production process in Clayton Valley, Nevada. Finally, during the second quarter, we announced our commitment to achieve net-zero greenhouse emissions by 2050. I'm very proud to lead the first service company that has set net-zero ambition that includes Scope 3 emissions. We have laid out an approach to climate change that is science-based, aligned with the 1.5 degrees Celsius target of the Paris Agreement, and is it built on a comprehensive near-term road map to achieve our goal -- with interim milestones in 2025 and 2030. As a company that prides itself on technology innovation, we aim to net the balance of emissions we produce in 2050 with carbon-negative actions. This plan also includes the launch of our Transition Technologies portfolio to support our customers on their journeys to net zero, such as the avoidance of flaring with Ora wireline technology and the track record [ph] of CYNARA CO2 membrane separation technology, as you have seen in this morning's release. Our net-zero ambition and the launch of Transition Technologies is an opportunity to contribute to the decarbonization of the industry, building through innovation, a resilient future that delivers higher value and lower carbon. Overall, I'm very pleased with our revenue quality, solid execution, enhanced market participation -- both in North America and internationally -- and most importantly the translation of all of these elements into another successive quarter of margin expansion. I want to thank here the entire Schlumberger team as they continue to execute and deliver outstanding performance for our customers and our communities despite COVID impact in several parts of the world. Next, I would like to share my view on the macroeconomic environment supporting our industry. While the rise of the COVID-19 Delta variant and resurgence of related disruptions could impact the pace of economic reopening, recent market projections continue to affirm an improving global economic outlook. Global GDP growth is now expected to approach 6% in 2021 and more than 4% in 2022, which will continue to drive a progressive recovery of oil demand. This outlook is supported by recent oil demand updates, which reflect the anticipation of wider vaccine-enabled recovery, improved mobility, and additional fiscal stimulus in large economies through the second half of the year. Looking farther out, the IEA projects that global oil demand will reach 100 million barrels per day and surpass pre-COVID levels by the end of 2022 in the absence of further policy change. If oil price are at elevated levels, the supply response to this demand recovery is developing broadly as anticipated. Indeed, this combination has resulted in a call on short-cycle production as well as an uptick in long-cycle projects reflected in new FIDs and encouraging recovery in both offshore developments and near-field exploration activity through the second quarter. In North America, this supply response is reflected in the rig count and frac fleet trends, with sustained strong growth through the first half of the year. Private operators led activity growth which resulted from the acceleration of DUC completions and increased drilling activity to replenish DUC inventory. By contrast, the embrace of capital discipline by the public operators is highlighted by the rig count still being significantly below the Q1 2020 total, despite WTI prices exceeding pre-pandemic levels. In this context, despite a solid activity growth outlook, we maintain our view that the North American market will be structurally smaller than in previous cycles as a consequence of capital discipline and industry consolidation. Moving to international markets, the deficit in investment needed to deliver the required oil supply represents a sustained growth opportunity, particularly in the low-cost, advantaged basins. We remain constructive on the structural pull on international supply and the resulting activity impact. This was already visible in the second quarter with a strong seasonal rebound and offshore recovery despite the impact of COVID disruptions in parts of Asia and in the Middle East. This also marked the second consecutive quarter of international rig count growth. Looking further out, we see favorable conditions for durable investment growth driven by the combination of actions by NOCs, internationally focused investment by public E&P operators and the expectation of continued supply discipline by OPEC+, all in response to the steady evolution of demand. The current pace of international tendering contract awards and increasing book-to-bill ratio support this view. Against this backdrop, Schlumberger is extremely well-positioned -- both in the international markets and in North America. Our market exposure is biased to accretive growth -- and with a series of new contract wins, our leading digital and fit-for-basin technology portfolio, and our performance strategy, we will create value for our customers and deliver industry-leading returns. Turning to the third quarter outlook, in North America, we see another quarter of growth, albeit somewhat moderating in U.S. land, led by private operators and horizontal oil drilling and a seasonal recovery in Canada. North America offshore will remain resilient, albeit with the hurricane season in view. Moving to the international markets, positive growth momentum is expected to continue through the third quarter across all areas. Short-cycle activity will be augmented by longer-cycle project startups. In this context, directionally, we expect our global third quarter revenue to grow by mid-single digits led by Reservoir Performance and Well Construction Divisions, while our pretax segment operating margins should further expand by 50 to 100 basis points. With this outlook for the third quarter, we remain confident in achieving double-digit international growth in the second half of 2021 when compared to the second half of 2020. As a consequence, and absent further COVID setback in operational recovery, we now foresee full year revenue growth both internationally and in North America, when excluding the impact of divestitures With activity recovery ahead of us through the third quarter and strong signals of a durable recovery beyond that, we can now clearly see a path to the high end of our full year EBITDA margin expansion guidance for 2021. Looking farther ahead, the fundamentals remain very favorable, with a growing economic rebound, supportive oil prices and a demand and supply outlook all representing a set of unique conditions that will support an exceptional growth cycle. Furthermore, this cycle will be broad-based across geographies and operational environments, land, offshore, North America and particularly, international markets. The second quarter was a strong indication of the future outlook and a testament of our restored earnings power under these conditions. In summary, I'm very pleased with our strong second quarter results across our entire portfolio, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our strategy in delivering our long-term financial ambition. I will now pass the call to Stephane. Thank you, Stephane. I think we are ready to open the floor for questions. Thank you. Good morning, James. Yes. Thanks, James. You are correct. I think we are very proud of this margin expansion. I think there were several factors I will highlight first on the second quarter and then project how we believe we have sustainability of margin expansion. So first and foremost, I think the performance was led by revenue expansion, revenue growth. I think revenue growth has worked out to be at or ahead of our expectation both internationally and in North America. I think credit to our team, credit to the customer centricity, the new organization and our performance. Secondly, I think we have seen a significant effect of our operating leverage as well as operational efficiency playing in full light during the quarter, and we expect this to be the base of our margin expansion for the quarters to come. So, this was in full display in all divisions and has led to this significant margin expansion, particularly in the service-led Reservoir Performance and Well Construction. Thirdly, the revenue quality, as I recall it, was led by favorable activity mix coming from the seasonal rebound in some basins, some regions, and that included an offshore mix that was favorable to those two divisions as well as well as an exploration and appraisal uptick, mid-teens exploration and appraisal offshore quarter-on-quarter during the second quarter. So when you combine this, this is representing a revenue mix quality that I think is unique. This was supplemented by technology adoption, technology adoptions linked to our fit-for-basin solution for customers that are seeing success. Digital, as you heard during the remarks prepared by Stephane, and lately the new technology transitions -- Transition Technologies portfolio, a combination of which is creating revenue quality that is then impacting favorably our margin. Lastly and this was only noticeable in North America, we had a couple of green shoots on pricing, on Well Construction that is also starting to be recognized. So, to project this forward, I think the seasonal rebound will not always be there every quarter. The unique exploration and appraisal uptick mix that we got also will not repeat, but you can count on us to leverage the future growth in the industry, both in North America and internationally to seize the operating leverage and operating efficiency we have, the favorable mix and the technology adoption that should fuel our margin expansion going forward. I think the progress we made this quarter was twofold. First, progress on our platform strategy. We continued to complete the platform foundations, the partnership, the enablement that give us extended market access such as what we are using from the IBM\\Red Hat technology to access hybrid clouds and unlock, if you like, about one-third of the addressable market by this hybrid cloud and in-country solution we provide. And I think we have made much progress there, and I think we are in the eighth or the ninth inning, if you like, on the platform readiness for full scalability and expansion. And we made progress on the adoption of DELFI as you have seen some announcements, and we continue to progress on rolling out for accounts that have already adopted DELFI. Hence, our revenue on the DELFI and the new technology of digital was significantly accretive to our growth, significantly accretive to D&I, and resulted into margin expansion flow-through that was visible this quarter. So that will not continue to be the same every quarter. It depends on the seasonality and on the specific, but expect directionally to continue to grow. Thank you, James. Yes. First, in short term, I would like to reiterate my positive commentary on the second quarter growth. It was all basins, all divisions internationally. So, it was broad and inclusive of Middle East. Now in the context of the Middle East in particular, the growth was maybe more muted or less aggressive and less accretive to the overall growth than other basins, and there are a couple of reasons for that. And the first and foremost reason is related to the supply constraints that are still outstanding on back and as such muting some of the short-cycle activity that we could have expected to rebound faster. So now going forward, there are a couple of factors that will play favorably short term and midterm. Short term, there will be a relief of some of these supply constraints that will continue to inch up the short cycle activity including Saudi. There is a commitment in Middle East for gas development. And I think Qatar was the first to expand their commitment, and we have benefited greatly from that rebound in activity for the last couple of quarters, and this will extend also to a couple of other countries, including Saudi. And lastly, as we turn into 2022, you have heard some signals from a couple of countries in GCC that have signaled that they will commit to production capacity increase to fulfill their opportunity to gain share as there will be a pull on international supply. So this will result from 2022 in combination of short cycle gas development, and long cycle across that region. And hence, they will catch up, and they will certainly be a region that will lead the activity growth and will support in second half our double-digit year-on-year H2 and next year into a strong growth going forward. Finally, if I have to make a comment on this, I think you may have seen some contract wins and contract award in Middle East. And we believe that on top of this activity growth, we have the potential to outperform and then getting a further tailwind to our growth going forward. No. Obviously, with the results we just delivered, we are increasing our confidence in our ability to reach and expand our margin going forward as the cycle unfolds. So starting with the next two or three years, we see now a strong case for a double-digit floor as an activity growth with an upside scenario. We see that the contract wins and the market position we have will benefit us to pull from this additional growth going forward. And the operational leverage, the activity mix including offshore and the technology adoption in doing digital will all create the condition, as I commented earlier, to expand our margins. So the ambition we have set to recover the net EBITDA dollar with less than half of the -- about half of the revenue recovery, I think, are still valid. And the mid-cycle ambition to expand the margin visibly is in full play. Thank you. Hi. Now it's a very valid question, and it's something that we observe, and some facts and some trends that has materialized in some index -- indices going up. But I believe that the toolbox we have, and professional and very expanse organization we have in our planning and supply chain and manufacturing organization that are used to manage some inflationary pressure has allowed us to mitigate and hedge at this inflationary pressure and contain cost inflation into -- under our rules. Now when and as this happens and on the specifics of logistics or specific material, we are engaging with our customers using the contract terms we have, to leverage an adjustment, and we have done so successfully with several customers. So we are confident that the combination of our supply chain capability with global and local leverage and the customer-centricity engagement approach we have, ability to sit and discuss the commercial terms give us the ability to support this and continue to drive forward and expand our margins. Thank you, Scott. Absolutely, Scott, we are very proud of this achievement, and let me give you the three drivers for it, in terms of top line growth. First and foremost, performance in the way we execute, and I think has led to -- from cementing to drilling, directional drilling or bits market share gain with both private and with operators, public operators in the U.S. The second factor is that, as you remember, as part of our North America strategy pivot that we did initiate two years ago, we accelerated our technology access, giving access of fit-for-basin technology to some local DD company that are then using, renting or buying our equipment and using it to serve their local customers, mostly, if not exclusively, private. So this has been going quarter-on-quarter, and this is helping us to reach market and expand our market share beyond what we could do to our service arm. And finally, as I mentioned in one of my response earlier, we had some green shoots where our performance was in high demand, our directional drilling equipment was seen as unique to deliver the curve. Hence, we could extract some pricing premium. So the combination of these three have delivered this 30% plus quarter-on-quarter top line delivery, far outpacing the rig count growth. So there are some exceptional, as always, but I would expect that the dynamic and directionally this to continue going forward, particularly the market share gain. Thank you, Scott. Yes, it's a very good question. It's something that we're working out to continue to make progress. But I think in a nutshell, I think the step change we did in some of the operational environment, our operational practice, including digital operation, has given us the opportunity to respond on the first peak of this cycle without deploying the same resource set as we have in the past, hence, getting direct efficiency gain as we mobilize and grow with the cycle. Going forward, and already initiated in some geographies where we had more than double-digit growth, as I mentioned, we had access to some resource that we onboarded during the quarter to respond to the contract we are winning. So the long cycle actually nature of international give us a bit more long-term visibility to this condition. Hence, our market approach is to target specific geographies and business line where we believe we can be generating accretive returns and growth and prepare for it by mobilizing ahead the resource or moving resource to address those. So I think we have a global access to talent. We are using a lot and at scale this remote operation. So it is a challenge for us to respond to high demand, but we believe that we have the operational environment to make it a success. I think in the early part of the cycle, I think we will use and the industry will use the excess supply that came from the compression of activity that came for the last two years. But again, we have very much professionalized our planning and supply organization. And I think from the Cameron to the asset that we have to deploy, I think we are trying to take a long-term view and scenario-based view on the future, looking beyond the 12-month horizon, and I'm starting to prepare and put some options so that we can respond to this growth going forward. Early part will not necessarily create a tightness, but the mid-cycle for sure, before the mid-cycle, this will create the condition for tightening supply and hence, some pricing conditions. Thank you. I think, first, we have, I'll say, a privileged market position with most of the NOCs in this OPEC+ consortium. We have seen across the broad spectrum of these NOCs' activity starting to build back, seasonal rebounds playing strongly in Russia. And we expect, as I said, this short cycle to recover for the next two to four quarters as the demand will be lifted, as the constraints will be lifted, and we see that more than one or two country will actually commit to this capacity expansion. And we have the footprint. We have the relationship. We have the fit-for-basin to leverage and then to respond to this capacity buildup and this growth opportunity in those, from Russia to Middle East, particularly. So I feel confident that these market share pursuits, that as the market comes back from '22, '23 will be giving us an opportunity to leverage our market position and move up. Thank you. Yes, I think as I commented before, we have to distinguish first the gas and the oil market. And on gas market, I think the activity has been more sustained, and as seen in Qatar, a significant commitment to accelerate the North field redevelopment and expansion. So that has been very positive, and we have the benefit of that exposure. And the gas remained steady and supported elsewhere. On oil, you have a mix. But in short term, it's mostly a short cycle in anticipation of the supply constraints relief. And for two or three of the country that participate to the GCC, they have already made public commitments that they will expand, and they will participate at scale into the post rebalance, if you like, of the supply and then participate to the capture of international share of supply into 2023. So that will mean plan that will materialize from planning, from contract and from execution into 2022. Yes. Let me first clarify, and not mix in the same umbrella, the New Energy portfolio that we have developed with the purpose to create a new chapter beyond oil and gas to participate at scale to the energy transition from hydrogen to CCS and geo energy or lithium, as you have heard, from the Transition Technologies that we believe are very pertinent to the decarbonization of our oil and gas industry, helping our customers to reduce their footprint, CO2 footprint, to reduce their GHG emission. And in this context, we are focusing on flaring elimination or reduction, and you are using, in particular, the Ora wireline technology to avoid returning the fluids to the surface and burn and dispose through flaring and do the reservoir characterization and testing in situ, if you like. And that's a unique technology that has significant impact on both efficiency and on the CO2 footprint for everyone using it. And we are looking at methane emission detection and containment. And we are looking at, as you have seen in the press release this morning, also the CYNARA CO2 membrane that have superior performance for large acid gas treatment, if you want, to do CO2 sequestration and capture. So you have these two aspects. So the Transition Technologies will come more and more into play. And most of the customer I meet are asking us whether we can help them and have a conversation engagement on to methane detection, flaring or other techniques that eliminate or reduce significantly the footprint of CO2 on every operation on their Scope 3 upstream, if you like, in addition to their Scope 1 direct emission. And then -- and that will be part of our technology growth, technology adoption in the quarters to come. And then longer term, we will build on our New Energy portfolio that we are building. And then once we have -- continue to build this, we will grow at scale from hydrogen to CCS and [geo-energy] (ph) with Celsius for the heating and cooling of buildings to lithium production is the pilot that we are initiating, and the contribution from Panasonic give us the opportunity to do so. So these are two different avenue for growth short term and long term. Thank you. Good morning Tommy. A very good question. I think first and foremost, I think let me highlight the, I think, two different, I would say, factor that will indeed leverage our current platform. First is the global deployment capability we have. We can industrialize and ship technology and deploy technology anywhere in the world, and we have done so for more than 80 or 90 years. And I think our ability to create franchise in every country from technology developed centrally or we develop locally, I think, is something that is unique, and I think that differentiates from many of the pure plays. The relationship we have and the customer base we have today will be occasionally, and I think will be the sense of the CCS where our customers have the opportunity to participate or in some of the downstream operation where they have a carbon capture or blue hydrogen opportunity could be an opportunity for us to continue to work with that customer base and expand. And at the same time, some of this company are turning into integrated energy company that will also participate at scale in the same market as we do. So that relationship will be useful, but I will more, I would say, highlight the global deployment capability. Now when it comes to capital allocation and capital deployment, I think it's very difficult to pinpoint too specific here. I think we will look again continue to mature this venture, prepare for scale as we start to, I would say, progress on our milestones, progress on our partnership and progress on the business model and the supply chain model that are quite different from the one we experience today. And then in that context, we'll make the appropriate capital allocation decision to be accretive to our long-term growth and to our returns. Thank you. I think in short term, the rebalance will be mostly down to the release of the spare capacity that, I think, exists. Now if you look at the current production of the U.S., which is 1.5 million barrels or about below -- in U.S. land -- below what it was in early 2020, this gap has not yet been breached. And I think I do not expect this to be breached as we exit 2022. So there will be an increment of oil supply that we will pull on international market that the market can deliver today. But for sustainability in '23 and '24, the market will have to commit capacity. Hence, this is the reason why in Middle East and other country, you see this commitment of capacity. And this is the reason why you see the return of offshore and the commitment of FID. We have 50 FID about already to date. We expect to be 100 FID, most of them in offshore at the end of the year. This is 50% more than it was last year, and the trajectory is towards 150 -- another 50% increment after that. So now going forward and expanding beyond, I would expect within the next two to three years, obviously, with this dynamic and the pull on the international supply will create the floor of activity to reach and/or exceed the level of 2019 activity within that time frame. Thank you very much. So to conclude the call, I would like to leave you with a few key takeaways. First, the second quarter results clearly demonstrate both the strength of our market position -- particularly internationally, with sequential growth in all Divisions and Basins -- and our significant operating leverage, resulting in more than 200 basis points of operating margin expansion internationally with all Divisions contributing significant fall-through. Second, the activity and customer trends observed during the quarter reinforce our conviction in an increasingly favorable outlook with a broad recovery across all basins and operating environments and with a much improved contribution from new technology adoption. Third, and absent further COVID setbacks impacting activity or economic rebounds, we are confident that the momentum for this upcycle -- both North America and internationally, will continue during the second half of 2021 and will lead to another quarter of growth and margin expansion. As a consequence, we remain confident in our second half guidance shared previously for international growth and have increased our confidence in our full year margin expansion and cash flow generation. Finally, as we look further ahead, the conditions are set for an exceptional growth cycle in response to the call for supply in 2022 and future demand growth in subsequent years. This will increasingly favor international supply impacting land and offshore, short and long cycle globally. Ladies and gentlemen, our returns-focused strategy, international footprint, digital, decarbonization, and new energy strategic initiatives are highly differentiated, and we support our outperformance ambition throughout the cycle and beyond as we continue to write a new chapter for the company. Thank you very much."

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, ND Maduemezia. Please go ahead.\nND Maduemezia: Thank you, Lea. Good morning, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being hosted from Houston, following the Schlumberger Limited Board meeting held earlier this week. Joining us on the call are Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Executive Officer, and Stephane Biguet, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind all participants that some of the statements we will be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected, in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and our other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our first-quarter press release, which is on our website. With that, I will turn the call over to Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, ND, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us on the call. In my prepared remarks today, I will cover three topics: our first-quarter results, our progress on our performance strategy, and finally, our outlook for the second quarter and second half of the year. Stephane will then give more detail on our financial results, and we will open the floor for questions. The first quarter of 2021 was a strong step forward. The quarter unfolded as we anticipated, with acceleration in North America activity and momentum continuing to build in the international markets, aside from the usual seasonal effects. We executed very well within that context. We expanded our global operating margins for the third consecutive quarter, and free cash flow was once again solidly positive.  Here are some highlights in support of this performance: Well Construction sustained growth sequentially, and in North America outpaced U.S. land rig counts, demonstrating enhanced market participation in the recovery. Reservoir Performance grew, when adjusted for the OneStim divestiture. Digital & Integration delivered another strong quarter with resilient margins, on track for our full-year targets.  In North America, execution of our returns-focused strategy drove strong margin expansion fully aligned with our double-digit margin targets.  And in international markets, despite severe seasonality and relative exposure in Russia and China, we continued growth across geographies. In this environment, and as the industry prepares for an upcycle, performance matters. And decisions on contract awards and capacity allocation are increasingly driven by technology and execution.  We were very pleased with the outcome of several international multiyear contract awards, specifically in Middle East and in offshore, building a pipeline that will support growth in 2022, and beyond. We are determined to drive performance differentiation, leveraging our fit-for-basin technology and digital capabilities. This combination benefited our integration performance, with our largest LSTK operations achieving a 6% improvement in drilling efficiency during the quarter.  This strong start to the year, characterized by resilient revenue, sequential margin expansion, and positive free cash flow, positions us very well, to meet our full-year financial ambitions and to deleverage our balance sheet. I want to congratulate the entire Schlumberger team, who delivered strong execution for our customers, having positioned us for the growth that is now underway. Next, I would like to comment on three elements of our performance strategy that present further opportunities for growth in this upcoming cycle and beyond, digital, sustainability and Schlumberger New Energy. Starting with Digital\u201418 months ago, we stated our ambition to lead the digital transformation in our industry and to significantly grow new digital revenue streams. I want today to update you with our progress. Our digital strategy is a platform strategy, leveraging unique and open platforms: DELFI, OSDU, and Agora. Since launching our core DELFI platform, we have significantly expanded its market reach, from Google Cloud, to Microsoft Azure, and more recently, using IBM Red Hat technology to enable hybrid cloud and offer fit-for-basin cloud solutions, as highlighted this morning in our collaboration with Yandex.  We'll continue to execute on this platform journey, to expand the choice for our customers, and to support our three digital business streams; workflow, data, and operations.  First, we offer our customers the opportunity to transition their technical workflows, from the desktop to the cloud, to realize productivity gains from DELFI workflow integration, collaboration, and access to scalable cloud computing. Our market leadership on the desktop position us very well to capture this market. In the last 18 months, our customers have increasingly transitioned to the cloud, resulting in 50% growth in our contract backlog, and a 10-fold increase in full-time DELFI users. As we expand our cloud-native application, and enable additional workflow within DELFI, we expect increased adoption across our customer base, resulting in steady growth of our digital workflow revenue. Second, recognizing that data is the key to unlock the industry digital transformation, we worked with the industry OSDU Forum to open source and contribute the underlying DELFI data ecosystem, helping to establish OSDU as the industry standard, an essential step to liberate data at scale for AI applications and to enable multi-vendor interoperable workflows. In this context, we recently partnered with Microsoft to offer Azure customers access to our OSDU Enterprise Data Management Solution. We will augment this offering with additional AI capabilities, and will also expand our geographical reach. The market potential for this data business stream is very significant as it underpins every customer digital transformation, as exemplified by our recent announcement with Equinor. Third, our customers\u2019 operations represent a unique opportunity to realize the promise of asset and field digital solutions. We designed an open IoT platform, Agora, to enable edge applications, complementing our DELFI platform operational workflows, and integrating with our partner, Sensia. Using Agora and DELFI, we are deploying digital operation solutions for drilling and production, both with our customers and as part of our integrated projects. This digital offering can significantly impact our own operations as was demonstrated this quarter in the Ecuador project and in our main LSTK operations, and also greatly benefit our customers. Our ambition is to establish critical market share in this white space, and accelerate collaboration with industry partners to further its adoption. These three digital business streams\u2014workflow, data, and operation, built on open platforms are supporting our digital growth ambition. We are very pleased with the progress on our platform foundation with the adoption by a broad set of customers, and are confident in the success of each business stream as we execute our roadmaps. Moving now to sustainability, we are strengthening our commitment to action, particularly as the industry faces the decarbonization mandate, and world leaders have reaffirmed commitments or advanced stronger goals in recent days. As it relates to climate action, this goes beyond reducing our own greenhouse gas emissions as we believe there is a significant opportunity for our technology and operating practice to decisively impact and accelerate the industry's decarbonization efforts as well as contribute towards emission reduction goals around the world. Our technology portfolio includes solutions that help our customers eliminate flaring, reduce fugitive methane emissions, and leverage automation and digital surveillance to reduce environmental impact. This technology focus on low carbon impact will be an increasing element of differentiation for Schlumberger in the future. An example that resonates with our customer is the complete electrification of offshore pollution systems. As outlined in our earnings release with the bp project for subsea electrification. This is the next offshore frontier and it will also pave the way to full digital enablement.  Beyond our industry, our CCS partnership with LafargeHolcim and the bio energy CCS project in Mendota, California are examples of cross sector initiative aligned with climate actions. Specifically, in Schlumberger New Energy we reached milestones in the sectors where we are participating across the energy transition: hydrogen, lithium, CCS, geothermal, and geo energy.  During the quarter, we established and accelerated new ventures, formed strategic partnerships, and gained market exposure, and are progressing in de-risking technology for up scaling.  We will continue to build out the New Energy portfolio throughout the year. And, we will keep you updated on our progress. We are extremely proud of the tangible results we have realized in only a short time, as it clearly outlines the power of the Schlumberger brand and the potential of this new chapter for the future of the company. Turning to the outlook, upward revisions in global economic forecast -- growth forecast by the IMF and positive demand forecast adjustment by both IEA and OPEC reinforce the transition into a demand-led recovery, which will strengthen through the second-half of 2021, absent new setbacks on vaccination rollouts or easing of lockdowns. Against this backdrop, we are increasingly confident in our full-year activity outlook. In North America, in the second quarter, we see sustained activity growth in U.S. lands, and a seasonal rebound in North America offshore being partially offset by the Canada breakup. As our first quarter results have shown, particularly in Well Construction, our new mix and sizeable exposure in the North America market will increasingly contribute to our results. Moving to international markets, activity growth will broaden in the second quarter with the seasonal recovery in Russia and China augmenting the continued growth in Africa and Middle East while Latin America should remain resilient. In addition, the offshore recovery will continue in the second quarter including the gradual return of exploration and appraisal in key international markets. The depth and divestiture for international franchise give us great exposure to these market expansions, especially in well construction and reservoir performance which will lead in the second quarter. More broadly, we anticipate all Divisions to grow sequentially at different pace. And margin expansion to be led again by reservoir performance and well construction. In light of this, directionally, we expect total second quarter revenue to grow in mid-single-digits and our operating margins to further expand by 50 to 100 basis points. Looking further into the second-half of 2021, in North America the pace of growth is expected to moderate on budget exhaustion and seasonal effects, but could surprise to the upside resulting in full-year growth when excluding the impact of divestures. In the international markets, our confidence in the second-half outlook has been strengthening based on the latest international rig count trends, CapEx signals and customer engagements. International activity will broaden and accelerate in the second half impacting short to long cycle both on land and offshore including deepwater in the most advantaged offshore basins. The magnitude of this leading indicators combined with upward revision to global economic growth and demand recovery present the potential for an even stronger inflection than initially anticipated for the second half of the year. Therefore, we have greater confidence in the previous guidance of a double digit increase in international revenue in the second half when compared to the same period last year. And absent of a setback in the post economic -- post pandemic recovery we foresee an upside for full-year growth internationally, resulting in a stronger footing as we enter 2022. In the context of this top line growth and the steps we took to reset the earnings power, we're confident that we'll fully realize our operating leverage to deliver our full-year ambition of 250 to 300 bps margin expansion year-over-year. We expect to continue expanding margins during the recovery to support increasing cash flow throughout the year, which will provide subsequent deleveraging opportunity. Now, I'd like to pass the call to Stephane.\nStephane Biguet: Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. First quarter earnings per share was $0.21, there were no charges or credits recorded during the first quarter of 2021. Excluding the charges and credits recorded in the previous periods, this represents a decrease of $0.01 sequentially and $0.04 when compared to the first quarter of last year. Overall, our first quarter revenue of $5.2 billion decreased approximately 6% sequentially. However, if we adjust for the OneStim and artificial lift, low-flow divestitures which were completed during the fourth quarter of last year, revenue was essentially flat sequentially despite the first quarter seasonality. Excluding the impact of divestitures, North America revenue increased 10% sequentially, reflecting significant activity increase on land partially offset by lower product sales offshore. International revenue declined only 3% sequentially despite the effects of the extended winter period we experienced in Russia, and the usual seasonality in that the Far East. Pretax operating margins were 12.7% and have now increased for three quarters in a row. In addition, pretax operating margins were 230 basis points higher compared to the same quarter of last year. This represents the highest margin since the third quarter of 2019. This strong margin performance reflects the significant operating leverage we have created through the combination of the high grading of our portfolio and our cost-out program which is now essentially complete. Company-wide adjusted EBITDA margins of 20.1% for the first quarter were flat sequentially as the positive impact of the OneStim divestiture was offset by the seasonal effects we typically experience in the first quarter. EBITDA margins were 203 basis points higher compared to the same quarter of last year. Let me now go through the first quarter results for each Division. First quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $773 million decreased 7% sequentially driven by seasonally lower sales of digital solutions and multi-client licenses. Margins only decreased by 37 basis points to 32% as the effects of the digital solutions and multi-client revenue declines were largely offset by improved profitability from APS projects. Reservoir Performance revenue of $1 billion decreased 20% sequentially. However, excluding the impact of the divested OneStim business revenue increased 3% despite seasonally lower revenue in Russia and China. The revenue growth was driven primarily by higher activity in Latin America and the Middle East. Margins increased 260 (sic) [261] basis points to 10.2%, largely due to the divestiture of the OneStim business that was dilutive to the Division's fourth quarter margins. Well Construction revenue of $1.9 billion increased 4% sequentially and margins increased 103 basis points to 10.8% due to increased activity in North America land and Latin America. This growth was partially offset by the seasonal slowdown in drilling activity in Russia and China. Production Systems revenue of $1.6 billion decreased 4% sequentially. International revenue declined 4% while North America was down 3%. Despite the revenue decline margins only decreased 71 basis points to 8.7% as a result of cost measures, as well as improved profitability in Midstream production systems due to higher activity. Now, turning to our liquidity, during the quarter, we generated $429 million of cash flow from operations, and positive free cash flow of $159 million, despite severance payments of $112 million, and the increase in working capital requirements, we always experience in the first quarter due to the annual payout of employee incentives. Our cash flow will improve throughout the rest of the year, consistent with our historical quarterly trends. Our net debt at the end of the first quarter was $13.7 billion, a decrease of $207 million when compared to the end of the previous quarter. During the quarter, we made capital investments of $270 million. This amount includes CapEx, investment in APS projects and multi-client. For full-year 2021, we are still expecting to spend between $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion on capital investments. On that note, let me take the opportunity to provide you with a quick update on our capital stewardship program. Optimizing the allocation of our capital investments will be critical to maximize the benefits of the ongoing activity recovery, which is poised to accelerate in the next few quarters. As part of the company's reorganization, we implemented a new capital allocation framework that governs all types of investments. The underlying principle behind the framework is that investment opportunities are prioritized based on returns and cash flow before any other metric. At the corporate level, this framework allows us to critically assess our technology portfolio and rationalize our offering to reduce capital intensity and maximize returns. At the Division level, we have strengthened our processes to ensure that new assets, as well as existing assets, are deployed where they will generate the highest returns. We are also leveraging this capital discipline to drive commercial behaviors and improve the quality of our revenue. With this in place, we remain confident in our ability to achieve double-digit cash flow margin -- free cash flow margin for the full-year of 2021, and beyond. This will allow us to deleverage the balance sheet, which remains a top priority for us. It is worth noting that during the quarter, the two major credit rating agencies confirmed our long-term credit ratings of A2 and A, respectively. Both cited our expected strong cash flow profile and our commitment to deleveraging. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Stephane. So, I believe that we are ready to open the floor for the Q&A session.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from James West with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nJames West: Hey, good morning, Olivier and Stephane.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Good morning, James.\nJames West: So, Olivier, great to hear your increased conviction about international top line growth in the second-half of this year, I'd love to hear or understand how you're thinking about the slope or shape of that recovery, and then really, as it relates more so to '22 and '23, which I think will be very important years?\nOlivier Le Peuch: No, thank you, James. I think, first, I think I believe it's clear that we are about to enter demand-led recovery. And I think the macro factor, both economic growth and what we are seeing, indicates that the oil demand recovery will reach 2019 level by or before the end of 2022. In this context, I believe that we are ready and starting at, and during the second-half of this year, facing the beginning of demand-led recovery that will trigger multiyear recovery cycle and industry upcycle. In this context, if you look at the recent period of underinvestment, look at the structural constraints in North America due to capital discipline, I believe that this will create the condition to create a significant pull on international supply. So, this will support international supply activity buildup, not only at the end of this year, but well into '22 and '23. In addition to this, I believe that the offshore, being a unique market, it's a privileged market for IOCs, some NOCs, and focused independents, will also see a gradual but very strong recovery over the long term. It is -- the offshore advantaged basins represents an extremely good oil production plateau for some basins at low carbon footprint. So this will support also the long-term international recovery. So, we believe -- we believe really that we are very well-positioned to outperform in this macro, because we believe that this macro outlook, that would include a growing international mix, including offshore, will play very well to our strengths. In addition, we have accelerated our strategy transformation, both the organizational transformation and key strategic elements, that will place very well from efficiency performance focus from our capital stewardship, our fit-for-basin that is resonating very well for our customer, and finally, for our digital and decarbonization strategic focus we have put in. So, I believe that we are seeing the beginning of this multiyear growth. We are also seeing that our performance strategy is resonating very well for our customers. And we have been awarded several multiyear contracts that are creating the backlog we need to support this growth going forward. So yes, I'm optimistic, not only on the second-half of this year, but on an accelerated path in 2022, and a long-cycle strength, including offshore, in '22, '23, and beyond.\nJames West: No, that was very clear, Olivier. Thanks for that. Maybe the second, the follow-up for me is on the margins. You've had good margin progression in the last two or three quarters. How do you think about sustainable margin progression and expansion as the recovery takes hold?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think going forward, James, as we enter this industry upcycle, I believe there are three elements that will favorably impact our margin expansion. First, I think is the -- as I described, is the very favorable macro outlook, that combined with the pace of international growth, the offshore elements, and also, as we are starting to see this quarter, the return of exploration and appraisal activity that is still needed to replenish the reserve. And also, that is becoming more near-field exploration, close to the offshore hubs in particular. So, these factors are very favorable. Secondly, I believe that we have created quality revenue initiatives as part of our initiative. First, fit-for-basin; fit-for-basin technology is creating the premium that differentiate us in some critical basin, in some critical assets, and give us the premium for revenue quality improvement. Similarly, I think our technology access, as we have seen in North America, has played a great role in helping us to expand market, but also to command premium with our technology partner. And finally, the success of Digital will be accretive over the period to this. So the third element I think beyond this strategy, I think is the step change we expect to materialize into our integration contracts, from a performance efficiency using Digital, as we have demonstrated already, using fit technology, and using practice that are becoming best-in-class. So, we believe that these three elements, the backdrop, the key element of our strategy for revenue quality, and the enhanced margin on our integrated contract will all combine to create a condition for further margin expansion, and acceleration of our margin expansion going forward.\nJames West: Excellent, thanks, Olivier.\nOperator: And our next question is from David Anderson with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.\nDavid Anderson: Hi, good morning, Olivier. Just want to follow-up on the discussion around the Middle East. You talk about robust growth in Saudi and Qatar this quarter. Really seems to be kind of first tangible signs of international inflection. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about that performance during the quarter, and whether or not those were new contracts starting up or existing contracts starting -- coming back on. But more importantly, I was wondering if you could just talk about the types of tenders that are being discussed in the Middle East? And do you see projects that would be expanding capacity in the region? And also, do you think this will be more project management work, I think you had talked about LSTK kind of doing a little bit better this quarter. Do you think that's going to be a bigger part of the mix going forward?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think, first, to comment on our growth in Middle East. Indeed, we had sequential growth in Middle East during the quarter. And I think this was led by, indeed, Saudi and Qatar to a large extent. And these were due to two factors, Qatar, I think, is our market position combined with the activity growth have resulted into activity. In Saudi, I think it's more related to performance, and activity share awards that resulted from our performance in execution in the quarter. And I think we see these factors of a strong market position we have of performance differentiation to help us go forward. So that's to maybe support and substantiate what we see going forward. In addition to this, as we have seen from last quarter to this quarter, we did announce some critical awards that are securing or expanding this market position in Middle East. Now, there is a lot of LSTK some of our peers have talked about large and very large contract tenders underway. So, I cannot and will not comment on this as these tenders are underway, but what can I say is that the activity is rebounding, the activity outlook both land and offshore Middle East will be strengthening. So, our customer are indeed securing capacity and looking for best performer and looking for, in a sense, the condition that would make them successful in their ambition to augment their capacity and augment the production going forward. So, it will be performance that will matter most in the future. For me, in my opinion.\nDavid Anderson: It makes sense. My other question is on the digital side. You made a lot of progress over the last year, establishing a footprint with your -- with the platform with DELFI across a lot of IOCs and NOCs, I believe Chevron is actually even implementing across the Permian. So, it feels like you're kind of where you want to be in terms of your footprint. It was interesting to hear you talk about the three elements of the workflow, data and operations. So, I'm just wondering if you could just maybe expand a bit on how you see each, the pace of growth in each of those. And what is that dependent upon? Partly I'm wondering is it, customers as getting more comfortable in using digital and day-to-day operations, but do you also need to build out new software applications or maybe it's just something else?\nOlivier Le Peuch: No, first I think it's clear that we need to recognize the industry as it has gone out of this crisis and turn into a new landscape as realize that digital is a tenent of the future. And digital is here to impact efficiency performance, and to make this industry more resilient for the long term. So first that has been a catalyst in the last 18 months that accelerate the adoption of digital that's the first. We believe that our platform strategy is being recognized, accepted, and across different customer type from national oil company to independent, to the IOCs. As you have seen, there is a large adoption of this, because we have kept this platform open. Now, when it comes to the pace and growth factor that differentiates workflow, data and operation, I believe that workflow is the one that is the most mature, because it builds on our existing desktop market leadership we have, and here we are transitioning the existing customer base we have towards to cloud. And each of them is realizing the power of the cloud from productivity, from collaboration, from access to scalable cloud computing. We simply need to reassure them that our platform is open and that they can make the choice their choice on the cloud infrastructure, which we are doing. The second, data, I think is renaissance of the data market that used to be a major market in digital 20 years ago. Everybody realized that without the data, we cannot unlock the power of digital transformation. So thankfully the industry has come together and has created, its OSDU platform Open Subsurface Data Universe driven by the Open Forum. And we have been fortunate to technically contribute our DELFI ecosystem to this. So on that foundation, every company will have to roll out and we'll certainly use the opportunity to roll out OSDU as a platform so that it unlocks the data access, liberate the data and then data provider, and then service provider, a consulting company, and the customer themselves will tap into these data using AI application. And this is where we want to participate, both the data transition to this new platform and the AI opportunity upon this. Finally, operation. Operation is the the biggest prize long-term, but also the most difficult to realize because every asset, every infrastructure on the field, every infrastructure on the edge is different. So while we believe that there is an immense opportunity to use digital in operation, and we are doing it very successfully, internally, the complexity, the system integration needs and the fit-for-purpose digital deployment will slow down. The adoption of this. Yet we'll make progress and we'll continue to partner with other companies to make sure that we offer integrated offering to the industry. When you combine these three at the different pace of growth, you create the condition for multiplicity of revenue stream that we support double digital ambition that we\u2019ll realize within the decade.\nDavid Anderson: Thanks for the information. Thank you.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nChase Mulvehill: Hey, good morning everybody. I guess first thing I wanted to hit on was kind of New Energy, so I don't know if maybe at a high level, could you take a minute and talk to how Schlumberger is viewing the New Energy environment and what are the key highlights of your New Energy transition strategy? And it actually would be great if you could lay out the prospective roadmap as Schlumberger embarks on this New Energy transition journey?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yes, great question, Chase. I think as you have seen, we've decided to enter a new chapter for the company and the way we decided to go after this is to first identify and selectively the domain in which we believe we can leverage our strengths. The subsurface can leverage our strengths, our technology, and global footprint to create and forge partnership, technology, acquisition, or organically grow the domain. So first we have decided to explore and establish market position and diversify our market entrants into this domain. So, you have seen that we have in parallel from lithium to CCS, from hydrogen to geo energy and geothermal created ventures, each of them with potentially a different partner for addressing different industry sector, so that we diversify not only our approach, but diversify and expand our market reach. So that has been the first is to make sure that we diversify our investments, diversify our market approach and our type of partnership. So that has been our first, I would say, a framework that we have used to develop this. Now, what is ambition, there, ambition is to create the future of the company in the long run. So within the decade and within the next two or three years specifically, we will the risk and scale this technology investment these venture investments, working with our partners, working internally to develop those technology as we are for green hydrogen as well with our CCS Mendota bioenergy plant or with LarfargeHolcim for CCS on cement plant. We will work, develop, embark into ventures where we will de-risk enhance, and then when it is derisked at scale, we'll then make bigger investments, large investments that will then support the long-term growth.\nChase Mulvehill: Perfect. And there is a quick follow-up to James first question around international, you mentioned that 2019 -- next year, we can kind of get back to 2019 levels. So I guess my question would be 2019 was pretty tight and you were starting to see some pricing. So if we get back to 2019 levels next year, like what could this mean for pricing? And when we think about the full international cycle, could we actually see a real pricing cycle unfold internationally as a recovery gains momentum?\nOlivier Le Peuch: First, I think our push to do this is first and foremost performance. We believe that performance creates the revenue opportunity, the revenue quality and the margin expansions we believe that are the foundation of our strategy. So, now whether the market capacity in some basin for some specific business line we create the condition for pricing. I believe it will. But again, you will depend on how do we differentiate for performance. How do we make sure that our technology is unique and is in high-demand and create conditions for the customer to accept to a premium on this technology and that's our approach. Now whether the capacity will create in a short-term global pricing, I don't think it will, certainly in the coming quarters, create pricing inflection on some business line in some basin, we are already seeing it today in North America for very specific Well Construction technology that is in high demand and the amount of premium.\nChase Mulvehill: Okay, perfect. Appreciate the color, Olivier\u2026\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you.\nOperator: And next we go to line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nScott Gruber: Yes, Hello.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Good morning, Scott.\nScott Gruber: Good morning. So the D&I margin at 32%, super impressive. How should we think about incrementals for that segment over the course of the year by definition, they obviously need to be healthy given the starting point, but what's a reasonable range and relatedly, and as you get deeper into these digital management contracts with customers, obviously profitability improves over time. Would that be a material driver during the rest of the year, or is that incremental margin bets that more in 22 and beyond?\nOlivier Le Peuch: No. First, I think we provided a guidance for full-year margin at 30%. And I think you have seen that the way we started the year is putting us on an excellent footing to realize that margin outlook, and this margin comes from two major factors. One is the performance of our integration contracts, and secondly, the strength and margin of our digital business. Now, going forward, and rolling into the later part of the year obviously, the digital will gradually start to improve its size and we'll create and generate the fall through that we believe will support this 30% ambition and could, as we exit 2021, clearly outperform and us on a better opportunity for margin expansion into 2022. So over time long-term the digital will indeed grow and we share that ambition there and we will clearly help continue to support these impressive margins and possibly expand it further in your long-term.\nScott Gruber: Got you. And just shifting gears a little bit and maybe somewhat premature to ask, but it just given that the international recovery outlook is strengthening and obviously the capital intensity to your portfolio is now on the decline. How do you think about the use of free cash flow, is the focus purely on building cash and deleveraging, what conditions would you look forward to start enhancing the cash return and as we move deeper into the recovery, is there a preference for dividend enhancement versus buy backs, when the time is right to return cash?\nStephane Biguet: So, I'll answer that question, Scott. Yes, you said that our immediate priorities is indeed to deleverage the balance sheet. At the same time, we want to make sure that we can sustain growth in our core business. Of course, even though our capex intensity has reduced quite a bit compared to the past, but we also need to leave enough capacity to execute our strategy, particularly as it relates to new horizons of growth. So, in any case, whether it relates to our core business or white spaces as I mentioned during the prepared remarks, any new investment will be looked at under the strict lens of our return-based capital allocation framework. And beyond that, yes, once we are filtered on this project, we will return any excess cash to our shareholders for either dividends or stock repurchases. We do not have a prescribed split between the two. It will depend on the conditions at that time. The time we have to make the decision and in particular, the sustainability of cash flows.\nScott Gruber: Got it. Appreciate it.\nOperator: And our next question is from Sean Meakim with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSean Meakim: Thanks. Good morning.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Good morning, Sean.\nSean Meakim: I appreciate the commentary on the outlook for the Middle East. Maybe just to follow-up, can we talk about the legacy margin dilutive LSTK contracts? Just to what extent have you been able to mitigate some of the challenges there? They're now a few years old. I was just curious to what extent does a contract roll create an opportunity for resetting the margin impact for those contracts maybe in the medium term?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yes, I think as you know for the last two years, I think we have been increasing our focus management and operational focus on resolving or improving this highly dilutive contracts that there were two or three years ago. And I think we have made great progress. I think whether they are exactly where I would like them to be, and accretive to the overall margin, maybe not, but I think we have made progress in three directions, first, in engaging our customer and making them realize the complexity and providing the support to execute this contract with better support and eliminating or mitigating some risk. Secondly, by adopting an accelerating adoption within this compact of fit-for-basin technology that is unique, and that we create for the long run an opportunity to set benchmark on those contracts hence to keep our market position and enhance our future execution. And finally, we have in the last few quarters, last few months actually, to roll out our digital operation capability to extract further automation, further efficiency on this. So we have improved, enhance customer collaboration on those contracts, we have created the technology portfolio that is starting to mitigate and enhance the operation execution. And we have rolled out unique digital features that are creating. So those conditions are unique, customer recognize it, and I think as we\u2019ll get the opportunity to renew this contract and expand would obviously look for making sure the commercial terms and the revenue quality will exploit in the future will be more accretive than they are today.\nSean Meakim: Thanks, Olivier. That's very helpful. It's encouraging as well. So just to come back maybe to cash flow north of $2 billion of free cash looks to be the bar here for full-year just given the 10% margin target. Could you just maybe highlight any major levers that would materially deviate from that goal? And then I'm also just thinking beyond cash flow? Are there plans for potential further pruning of the portfolio to optimize fit-for-basin maybe help accelerate de-levering of the balance sheet?\nStephane Biguet: So look, Sean I don't think there's anything that's going to deviate from us achieving double-digit, i.e. possibly more than 10% free cash flow this year. There is a typical seasonality in the working cap and free cash flow throughout the year. So free cash flow will improve quarter-after-quarter like it has in the past and we'll deliver on that ambition. It can be enhanced by exceptional proceeds. We're continuously looking at our portfolio as I mentioned earlier, we're particularly working on two key divestitures. One is I mentioned in the previous quarter that in regards to our APS portfolio, we're looking at launching very soon in the next few days actually a formal process for the APS assets in Canada, there's a lot of interest still and the economics have improved quite a bit. So we're quite hopeful there to close a good transaction. And the second one is the rigs we have in the Middle East, we're actually even more advanced there, we're in the formal process, we have short listed a few interested buyers and they're just concluding the due diligence. So we should be closing or at least signing sorry this transaction in the next few months. So this will enhance the cash flow profile and the potential reduction of our net debt and the flexibility it will give on liquidity, basically.\nSean Meakim: Very helpful. Thanks to you both.\nStephane Biguet: Thank you.\nOperator: Next we go to Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nConnor Lynagh: Thanks, good morning.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Good morning, Connor.\nConnor Lynagh: I think we had noticed that you guys were a bit more upbeat on the offshore side of things. And basically, I'm wondering if you could frame how you think that markets going to trend relative to last cycle? And in particular, how do you think customers are thinking about exploration activity?\nOlivier Le Peuch: That's a great question. I think first, it's worth saying that the offshore basins and the most advantage offshore basins are still very much, very critical resource and core resource for some of our customers, I'll seize some unique NOCs and the few independent that are pure play offshore independent from relative medium to large size. So first these resource are precious, this resource typically have a good geology. And as I said, both from the production plateau, they provide and the low carbon opportunity they have in term of mix or API grade, I think these are excellent resources. The second thing I believe is that the economics for offshore due to integration success, FEED technology and digital practice have improved from the last cycle. And I think opportunity exists for industry to leverage this and accelerate some FID going forward. So, another factor that is very critical as you touch the exploration appraisal is that most of the major and large NOC on this -- in this context are recognizing the impact of exploiting hubs, offshore hubs and the offshore hubs, the opportunities is to exploit those hubs to improve the return on asset, improve return on infrastructure and focus on near field or backyard exploration, so that they maximize the return on existing infrastructure, existing FPSO existing platform. So, that it is also something that plays very well in our portfolio for configuring or for subsidy back as we are expanding this domain. So, I believe that the expression appraisal will not necessarily accelerating frontier exploration, but will accelerate the near field exploration offshore, and we\u2019re starting to see this this quarter and will accelerate during the second-half of the year. So I'm optimistic indeed on offshore and if you read some of the Rystad or IHS reports or some of the reports, highlighting the FID pipeline, and you see that FID pipeline that are already pre committed towards '22 '23 have the potential over '22, '23 and beyond to eclipse the last 2017, 2019 in terms of number of projects, but also in terms of total CapEx invested in deepwater.\nConnor Lynagh: Got it. It's helpful. And maybe just sticking with the offshore theme, could you help us think through on the Production Systems, I think you called out you expected all Divisions to grow sequentially, but how should we think through the long cycle portion of that business particularly the subsea business?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yes, I think first the Production System I think is not only subsea system as both short and long cycle as exposure in short cycle in North America to the ESP which is coming back strongly and the Cameron surface equipment also servicing the frac and our partner Liberty and also internationally is indeed a mix of short for ESP and some completion equipment and long cycle for midstream as well as for subsea and surface equipment. So, it's a mix of long and short with very, very tangible exposure in North America benefiting short-term and long-term international long cycle both recovery and production new products. In that context and back to the point on offshore, I believe that the subsea market is very alive, and I think last year the number of subsidiaries were so short of 200 compared to higher than 50 in 2019. The prediction this year is to be above 200, 220 these are our prediction and that's align with the market prediction and this will be more or less increasing going forward gradually to be within between 250 to 300 over the mid-term period to support these offshore project.\nConnor Lynagh: Appreciate the color. Thank you.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Connor.\nOperator: And our next question is from Marc Bianchi with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.\nMarc Bianchi: Thank you. The guidance for second quarter for the mid-single-digit revenue and 50 to 100 of margin improvement seems to suggest a little bit maybe weaker margin progression than I would have otherwise expected and certainly if I look at the operating leverage of the business that's had over the past few quarters. It would seem that there's a little bit less operating leverage implied in second quarter. So, I'm curious, are there some unusual costs that you're realizing perhaps there\u2019s startup costs for some of these contracts you mentioned? Any color around that and how maybe that could progress beyond second quarter would be helpful.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yes, Marc, thank you for the question. So indeed, our guidance, though, for operating margin expansion between 50 and 100 bps into the mid single-digit would still imply on the high end of that on that range 30-plus incremental [margin] (added by the company after the call). So, I believe that this is the first remark. The second is that we are still on track. Okay and very confident on our 250 to 300 bps full-year margin expansion. So, in the second quarter, indeed, there are two factors. One is the fact that you're mobilizing for what the offshore return and some of the activity that are prepping and mobilizing for the second half already in the later part of the quarter. But also there are some persistent but temporary COVID-related constraints and costs that as the lockdown are still in place in many countries that adding costs upfront, in to those mobilization and making this mobilization cost maybe a little bit more than they would have been in other cycles in the past. So these are the factors that are shaping up. But we're very confident that the margin expansion is in place and we continue going forward.\nMarc Bianchi: Wonderful, thank you for that. And then you mentioned in your prepared remarks and then in also in the press release about the kind of double-digit growth for the second-half in international setting up for kind of upside to already robust growth anticipated for '22. I'm curious what the baseline is for that comment. Are you referring to a market forecast that's out there? Are you referring to sell side consensus, just curious what the benchmark we should be thinking about this?\nOlivier Le Peuch: No, it's a combination of facts. As I said, I think there are some market indicators from the CapEx of some of the NOC national company, there is rig counts projection that we're making based on engagement with customer and with rig contractor. And there are some markets position or market enhancements and contract award, we have been benefiting in the last few quarters. So the mix of our market position, favorable mix, the market expansion on international for that has an element of seasonal effect as well as re-investments. And the national oil company, increasing the investment in second half, all combined to make us more confident in where three months ago on the shape and inflection of this recovery in the second-half.\nMarc Bianchi: Got it. Thanks, Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you very much. Last question\u2026\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, I'll turn you back to Schlumberger for closing remarks.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Okay, thank you very much. So, thank you. And to conclude, I'd like to offer three takeaways: First, the macro economic and activity outlook are increasingly supporting an attractive industry upcycle, characterized with an inflection in international activity, a consolidation of short-cycle activity, and the return advantage offshore plays, all playing to our core strength. In particular, we're increasingly optimistic about the international growth trajectory during the second-half of the year, which absent of a setback in pandemic recovery, will result in full-year international growth. As a consequence, we have reinforced our confidence in our 2021 financial targets on margin expansion, and free cash flow generation. Second, we're convinced that our performance strategy is aligned with a new industry landscape, and is increasingly resonating with our customer as performance matters critically in this environment. This is translating into market wins, particularly in the Middle East and offshore basins, and will support our ambition to outperform through this cycle. In addition, the steady progress in our digital strategy will translate over time in expanding new revenue streams and accretive margins. Third, the margin expansion realized this quarter both sequentially, and year-on-year is reflecting the impact of both our capital stewardship strategy and the restructuring program and will translate into substantial operating leverage as the year progress and activities strengthens in all basins. We anticipate the upcoming quarters to further this margin expansion with broad contribution from our Basins, and Divisions. Finally, our commitment towards both sustainability and New Energy is materializing in a growing portfolio of technology and ventures that will contribute to the global climate actions and to the future of the company. Ladies and gentlemen, this year represents a unique opportunity for the new Schlumberger to execute on its new performance journey and outperform the market within an increasingly attractive outlook. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference Service.

            "name": "Stephane Biguet",
            "content": "Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. First quarter earnings per share was $0.21, there were no charges or credits recorded during the first quarter of 2021. Excluding the charges and credits recorded in the previous periods, this represents a decrease of $0.01 sequentially and $0.04 when compared to the first quarter of last year. Overall, our first quarter revenue of $5.2 billion decreased approximately 6% sequentially. However, if we adjust for the OneStim and artificial lift, low-flow divestitures which were completed during the fourth quarter of last year, revenue was essentially flat sequentially despite the first quarter seasonality. Excluding the impact of divestitures, North America revenue increased 10% sequentially, reflecting significant activity increase on land partially offset by lower product sales offshore. International revenue declined only 3% sequentially despite the effects of the extended winter period we experienced in Russia, and the usual seasonality in that the Far East. Pretax operating margins were 12.7% and have now increased for three quarters in a row. In addition, pretax operating margins were 230 basis points higher compared to the same quarter of last year. This represents the highest margin since the third quarter of 2019. This strong margin performance reflects the significant operating leverage we have created through the combination of the high grading of our portfolio and our cost-out program which is now essentially complete. Company-wide adjusted EBITDA margins of 20.1% for the first quarter were flat sequentially as the positive impact of the OneStim divestiture was offset by the seasonal effects we typically experience in the first quarter. EBITDA margins were 203 basis points higher compared to the same quarter of last year. Let me now go through the first quarter results for each Division. First quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $773 million decreased 7% sequentially driven by seasonally lower sales of digital solutions and multi-client licenses. Margins only decreased by 37 basis points to 32% as the effects of the digital solutions and multi-client revenue declines were largely offset by improved profitability from APS projects. Reservoir Performance revenue of $1 billion decreased 20% sequentially. However, excluding the impact of the divested OneStim business revenue increased 3% despite seasonally lower revenue in Russia and China. The revenue growth was driven primarily by higher activity in Latin America and the Middle East. Margins increased 260 (sic) [261] basis points to 10.2%, largely due to the divestiture of the OneStim business that was dilutive to the Division's fourth quarter margins. Well Construction revenue of $1.9 billion increased 4% sequentially and margins increased 103 basis points to 10.8% due to increased activity in North America land and Latin America. This growth was partially offset by the seasonal slowdown in drilling activity in Russia and China. Production Systems revenue of $1.6 billion decreased 4% sequentially. International revenue declined 4% while North America was down 3%. Despite the revenue decline margins only decreased 71 basis points to 8.7% as a result of cost measures, as well as improved profitability in Midstream production systems due to higher activity. Now, turning to our liquidity, during the quarter, we generated $429 million of cash flow from operations, and positive free cash flow of $159 million, despite severance payments of $112 million, and the increase in working capital requirements, we always experience in the first quarter due to the annual payout of employee incentives. Our cash flow will improve throughout the rest of the year, consistent with our historical quarterly trends. Our net debt at the end of the first quarter was $13.7 billion, a decrease of $207 million when compared to the end of the previous quarter. During the quarter, we made capital investments of $270 million. This amount includes CapEx, investment in APS projects and multi-client. For full-year 2021, we are still expecting to spend between $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion on capital investments. On that note, let me take the opportunity to provide you with a quick update on our capital stewardship program. Optimizing the allocation of our capital investments will be critical to maximize the benefits of the ongoing activity recovery, which is poised to accelerate in the next few quarters. As part of the company's reorganization, we implemented a new capital allocation framework that governs all types of investments. The underlying principle behind the framework is that investment opportunities are prioritized based on returns and cash flow before any other metric. At the corporate level, this framework allows us to critically assess our technology portfolio and rationalize our offering to reduce capital intensity and maximize returns. At the Division level, we have strengthened our processes to ensure that new assets, as well as existing assets, are deployed where they will generate the highest returns. We are also leveraging this capital discipline to drive commercial behaviors and improve the quality of our revenue. With this in place, we remain confident in our ability to achieve double-digit cash flow margin -- free cash flow margin for the full-year of 2021, and beyond. This will allow us to deleverage the balance sheet, which remains a top priority for us. It is worth noting that during the quarter, the two major credit rating agencies confirmed our long-term credit ratings of A2 and A, respectively. Both cited our expected strong cash flow profile and our commitment to deleveraging. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier. So, I'll answer that question, Scott. Yes, you said that our immediate priorities is indeed to deleverage the balance sheet. At the same time, we want to make sure that we can sustain growth in our core business. Of course, even though our capex intensity has reduced quite a bit compared to the past, but we also need to leave enough capacity to execute our strategy, particularly as it relates to new horizons of growth. So, in any case, whether it relates to our core business or white spaces as I mentioned during the prepared remarks, any new investment will be looked at under the strict lens of our return-based capital allocation framework. And beyond that, yes, once we are filtered on this project, we will return any excess cash to our shareholders for either dividends or stock repurchases. We do not have a prescribed split between the two. It will depend on the conditions at that time. The time we have to make the decision and in particular, the sustainability of cash flows. So look, Sean I don't think there's anything that's going to deviate from us achieving double-digit, i.e. possibly more than 10% free cash flow this year. There is a typical seasonality in the working cap and free cash flow throughout the year. So free cash flow will improve quarter-after-quarter like it has in the past and we'll deliver on that ambition. It can be enhanced by exceptional proceeds. We're continuously looking at our portfolio as I mentioned earlier, we're particularly working on two key divestitures. One is I mentioned in the previous quarter that in regards to our APS portfolio, we're looking at launching very soon in the next few days actually a formal process for the APS assets in Canada, there's a lot of interest still and the economics have improved quite a bit.

            "name": "Olivier Le Peuch",
            "content": "Thank you, ND, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us on the call. In my prepared remarks today, I will cover three topics: our first-quarter results, our progress on our performance strategy, and finally, our outlook for the second quarter and second half of the year. Stephane will then give more detail on our financial results, and we will open the floor for questions. The first quarter of 2021 was a strong step forward. The quarter unfolded as we anticipated, with acceleration in North America activity and momentum continuing to build in the international markets, aside from the usual seasonal effects. We executed very well within that context. We expanded our global operating margins for the third consecutive quarter, and free cash flow was once again solidly positive.  Here are some highlights in support of this performance: Well Construction sustained growth sequentially, and in North America outpaced U.S. land rig counts, demonstrating enhanced market participation in the recovery. Reservoir Performance grew, when adjusted for the OneStim divestiture. Digital & Integration delivered another strong quarter with resilient margins, on track for our full-year targets.  In North America, execution of our returns-focused strategy drove strong margin expansion fully aligned with our double-digit margin targets.  And in international markets, despite severe seasonality and relative exposure in Russia and China, we continued growth across geographies. In this environment, and as the industry prepares for an upcycle, performance matters. And decisions on contract awards and capacity allocation are increasingly driven by technology and execution.  We were very pleased with the outcome of several international multiyear contract awards, specifically in Middle East and in offshore, building a pipeline that will support growth in 2022, and beyond. We are determined to drive performance differentiation, leveraging our fit-for-basin technology and digital capabilities. This combination benefited our integration performance, with our largest LSTK operations achieving a 6% improvement in drilling efficiency during the quarter.  This strong start to the year, characterized by resilient revenue, sequential margin expansion, and positive free cash flow, positions us very well, to meet our full-year financial ambitions and to deleverage our balance sheet. I want to congratulate the entire Schlumberger team, who delivered strong execution for our customers, having positioned us for the growth that is now underway. Next, I would like to comment on three elements of our performance strategy that present further opportunities for growth in this upcoming cycle and beyond, digital, sustainability and Schlumberger New Energy. Starting with Digital\u201418 months ago, we stated our ambition to lead the digital transformation in our industry and to significantly grow new digital revenue streams. I want today to update you with our progress. Our digital strategy is a platform strategy, leveraging unique and open platforms: DELFI, OSDU, and Agora. Since launching our core DELFI platform, we have significantly expanded its market reach, from Google Cloud, to Microsoft Azure, and more recently, using IBM Red Hat technology to enable hybrid cloud and offer fit-for-basin cloud solutions, as highlighted this morning in our collaboration with Yandex.  We'll continue to execute on this platform journey, to expand the choice for our customers, and to support our three digital business streams; workflow, data, and operations.  First, we offer our customers the opportunity to transition their technical workflows, from the desktop to the cloud, to realize productivity gains from DELFI workflow integration, collaboration, and access to scalable cloud computing. Our market leadership on the desktop position us very well to capture this market. In the last 18 months, our customers have increasingly transitioned to the cloud, resulting in 50% growth in our contract backlog, and a 10-fold increase in full-time DELFI users. As we expand our cloud-native application, and enable additional workflow within DELFI, we expect increased adoption across our customer base, resulting in steady growth of our digital workflow revenue. Second, recognizing that data is the key to unlock the industry digital transformation, we worked with the industry OSDU Forum to open source and contribute the underlying DELFI data ecosystem, helping to establish OSDU as the industry standard, an essential step to liberate data at scale for AI applications and to enable multi-vendor interoperable workflows. In this context, we recently partnered with Microsoft to offer Azure customers access to our OSDU Enterprise Data Management Solution. We will augment this offering with additional AI capabilities, and will also expand our geographical reach. The market potential for this data business stream is very significant as it underpins every customer digital transformation, as exemplified by our recent announcement with Equinor. Third, our customers' operations represent a unique opportunity to realize the promise of asset and field digital solutions. We designed an open IoT platform, Agora, to enable edge applications, complementing our DELFI platform operational workflows, and integrating with our partner, Sensia. Using Agora and DELFI, we are deploying digital operation solutions for drilling and production, both with our customers and as part of our integrated projects. This digital offering can significantly impact our own operations as was demonstrated this quarter in the Ecuador project and in our main LSTK operations, and also greatly benefit our customers. Our ambition is to establish critical market share in this white space, and accelerate collaboration with industry partners to further its adoption. These three digital business streams\u2014workflow, data, and operation, built on open platforms are supporting our digital growth ambition. We are very pleased with the progress on our platform foundation with the adoption by a broad set of customers, and are confident in the success of each business stream as we execute our roadmaps. Moving now to sustainability, we are strengthening our commitment to action, particularly as the industry faces the decarbonization mandate, and world leaders have reaffirmed commitments or advanced stronger goals in recent days. As it relates to climate action, this goes beyond reducing our own greenhouse gas emissions as we believe there is a significant opportunity for our technology and operating practice to decisively impact and accelerate the industry's decarbonization efforts as well as contribute towards emission reduction goals around the world. Our technology portfolio includes solutions that help our customers eliminate flaring, reduce fugitive methane emissions, and leverage automation and digital surveillance to reduce environmental impact. This technology focus on low carbon impact will be an increasing element of differentiation for Schlumberger in the future. An example that resonates with our customer is the complete electrification of offshore pollution systems. As outlined in our earnings release with the bp project for subsea electrification. This is the next offshore frontier and it will also pave the way to full digital enablement.  Beyond our industry, our CCS partnership with LafargeHolcim and the bio energy CCS project in Mendota, California are examples of cross sector initiative aligned with climate actions. Specifically, in Schlumberger New Energy we reached milestones in the sectors where we are participating across the energy transition: hydrogen, lithium, CCS, geothermal, and geo energy.  During the quarter, we established and accelerated new ventures, formed strategic partnerships, and gained market exposure, and are progressing in de-risking technology for up scaling.  We will continue to build out the New Energy portfolio throughout the year. And, we will keep you updated on our progress. We are extremely proud of the tangible results we have realized in only a short time, as it clearly outlines the power of the Schlumberger brand and the potential of this new chapter for the future of the company. Turning to the outlook, upward revisions in global economic forecast -- growth forecast by the IMF and positive demand forecast adjustment by both IEA and OPEC reinforce the transition into a demand-led recovery, which will strengthen through the second-half of 2021, absent new setbacks on vaccination rollouts or easing of lockdowns. Against this backdrop, we are increasingly confident in our full-year activity outlook. In North America, in the second quarter, we see sustained activity growth in U.S. lands, and a seasonal rebound in North America offshore being partially offset by the Canada breakup. As our first quarter results have shown, particularly in Well Construction, our new mix and sizeable exposure in the North America market will increasingly contribute to our results. Moving to international markets, activity growth will broaden in the second quarter with the seasonal recovery in Russia and China augmenting the continued growth in Africa and Middle East while Latin America should remain resilient. In addition, the offshore recovery will continue in the second quarter including the gradual return of exploration and appraisal in key international markets. The depth and divestiture for international franchise give us great exposure to these market expansions, especially in well construction and reservoir performance which will lead in the second quarter. More broadly, we anticipate all Divisions to grow sequentially at different pace. And margin expansion to be led again by reservoir performance and well construction. In light of this, directionally, we expect total second quarter revenue to grow in mid-single-digits and our operating margins to further expand by 50 to 100 basis points. Looking further into the second-half of 2021, in North America the pace of growth is expected to moderate on budget exhaustion and seasonal effects, but could surprise to the upside resulting in full-year growth when excluding the impact of divestures. In the international markets, our confidence in the second-half outlook has been strengthening based on the latest international rig count trends, CapEx signals and customer engagements. International activity will broaden and accelerate in the second half impacting short to long cycle both on land and offshore including deepwater in the most advantaged offshore basins. The magnitude of this leading indicators combined with upward revision to global economic growth and demand recovery present the potential for an even stronger inflection than initially anticipated for the second half of the year. Therefore, we have greater confidence in the previous guidance of a double digit increase in international revenue in the second half when compared to the same period last year. And absent of a setback in the post economic -- post pandemic recovery we foresee an upside for full-year growth internationally, resulting in a stronger footing as we enter 2022. In the context of this top line growth and the steps we took to reset the earnings power, we're confident that we'll fully realize our operating leverage to deliver our full-year ambition of 250 to 300 bps margin expansion year-over-year. We expect to continue expanding margins during the recovery to support increasing cash flow throughout the year, which will provide subsequent deleveraging opportunity. Now, I'd like to pass the call to Stephane. Thank you, Stephane. So, I believe that we are ready to open the floor for the Q&A session. Good morning, James. No, thank you, James. I think, first, I think I believe it's clear that we are about to enter demand-led recovery. And I think the macro factor, both economic growth and what we are seeing, indicates that the oil demand recovery will reach 2019 level by or before the end of 2022. In this context, I believe that we are ready and starting at, and during the second-half of this year, facing the beginning of demand-led recovery that will trigger multiyear recovery cycle and industry upcycle. In this context, if you look at the recent period of underinvestment, look at the structural constraints in North America due to capital discipline, I believe that this will create the condition to create a significant pull on international supply. So, this will support international supply activity buildup, not only at the end of this year, but well into '22 and '23. In addition to this, I believe that the offshore, being a unique market, it's a privileged market for IOCs, some NOCs, and focused independents, will also see a gradual but very strong recovery over the long term. It is -- the offshore advantaged basins represents an extremely good oil production plateau for some basins at low carbon footprint. So this will support also the long-term international recovery. So, we believe -- we believe really that we are very well-positioned to outperform in this macro, because we believe that this macro outlook, that would include a growing international mix, including offshore, will play very well to our strengths. In addition, we have accelerated our strategy transformation, both the organizational transformation and key strategic elements, that will place very well from efficiency performance focus from our capital stewardship, our fit-for-basin that is resonating very well for our customer, and finally, for our digital and decarbonization strategic focus we have put in. So, I believe that we are seeing the beginning of this multiyear growth. We are also seeing that our performance strategy is resonating very well for our customers. And we have been awarded several multiyear contracts that are creating the backlog we need to support this growth going forward. So yes, I'm optimistic, not only on the second-half of this year, but on an accelerated path in 2022, and a long-cycle strength, including offshore, in '22, '23, and beyond. I think going forward, James, as we enter this industry upcycle, I believe there are three elements that will favorably impact our margin expansion. First, I think is the -- as I described, is the very favorable macro outlook, that combined with the pace of international growth, the offshore elements, and also, as we are starting to see this quarter, the return of exploration and appraisal activity that is still needed to replenish the reserve. And also, that is becoming more near-field exploration, close to the offshore hubs in particular. So, these factors are very favorable. Secondly, I believe that we have created quality revenue initiatives as part of our initiative. First, fit-for-basin; fit-for-basin technology is creating the premium that differentiate us in some critical basin, in some critical assets, and give us the premium for revenue quality improvement. Similarly, I think our technology access, as we have seen in North America, has played a great role in helping us to expand market, but also to command premium with our technology partner. And finally, the success of Digital will be accretive over the period to this. So the third element I think beyond this strategy, I think is the step change we expect to materialize into our integration contracts, from a performance efficiency using Digital, as we have demonstrated already, using fit technology, and using practice that are becoming best-in-class. So, we believe that these three elements, the backdrop, the key element of our strategy for revenue quality, and the enhanced margin on our integrated contract will all combine to create a condition for further margin expansion, and acceleration of our margin expansion going forward. I think, first, to comment on our growth in Middle East. Indeed, we had sequential growth in Middle East during the quarter. And I think this was led by, indeed, Saudi and Qatar to a large extent. And these were due to two factors, Qatar, I think, is our market position combined with the activity growth have resulted into activity. In Saudi, I think it's more related to performance, and activity share awards that resulted from our performance in execution in the quarter. And I think we see these factors of a strong market position we have of performance differentiation to help us go forward. So that's to maybe support and substantiate what we see going forward. In addition to this, as we have seen from last quarter to this quarter, we did announce some critical awards that are securing or expanding this market position in Middle East. Now, there is a lot of LSTK some of our peers have talked about large and very large contract tenders underway. So, I cannot and will not comment on this as these tenders are underway, but what can I say is that the activity is rebounding, the activity outlook both land and offshore Middle East will be strengthening. So, our customer are indeed securing capacity and looking for best performer and looking for, in a sense, the condition that would make them successful in their ambition to augment their capacity and augment the production going forward. So, it will be performance that will matter most in the future. For me, in my opinion. No, first I think it's clear that we need to recognize the industry as it has gone out of this crisis and turn into a new landscape as realize that digital is a tenent of the future. And digital is here to impact efficiency performance, and to make this industry more resilient for the long term. So first that has been a catalyst in the last 18 months that accelerate the adoption of digital that's the first. We believe that our platform strategy is being recognized, accepted, and across different customer type from national oil company to independent, to the IOCs. As you have seen, there is a large adoption of this, because we have kept this platform open. Now, when it comes to the pace and growth factor that differentiates workflow, data and operation, I believe that workflow is the one that is the most mature, because it builds on our existing desktop market leadership we have, and here we are transitioning the existing customer base we have towards to cloud. And each of them is realizing the power of the cloud from productivity, from collaboration, from access to scalable cloud computing. We simply need to reassure them that our platform is open and that they can make the choice their choice on the cloud infrastructure, which we are doing. The second, data, I think is renaissance of the data market that used to be a major market in digital 20 years ago. Everybody realized that without the data, we cannot unlock the power of digital transformation. So thankfully the industry has come together and has created, its OSDU platform Open Subsurface Data Universe driven by the Open Forum. And we have been fortunate to technically contribute our DELFI ecosystem to this. So on that foundation, every company will have to roll out and we'll certainly use the opportunity to roll out OSDU as a platform so that it unlocks the data access, liberate the data and then data provider, and then service provider, a consulting company, and the customer themselves will tap into these data using AI application. And this is where we want to participate, both the data transition to this new platform and the AI opportunity upon this. Finally, operation. Operation is the the biggest prize long-term, but also the most difficult to realize because every asset, every infrastructure on the field, every infrastructure on the edge is different. So while we believe that there is an immense opportunity to use digital in operation, and we are doing it very successfully, internally, the complexity, the system integration needs and the fit-for-purpose digital deployment will slow down. The adoption of this. Yet we'll make progress and we'll continue to partner with other companies to make sure that we offer integrated offering to the industry. When you combine these three at the different pace of growth, you create the condition for multiplicity of revenue stream that we support double digital ambition that we'll realize within the decade. Thank you. Yes, great question, Chase. I think as you have seen, we've decided to enter a new chapter for the company and the way we decided to go after this is to first identify and selectively the domain in which we believe we can leverage our strengths. The subsurface can leverage our strengths, our technology, and global footprint to create and forge partnership, technology, acquisition, or organically grow the domain. So first we have decided to explore and establish market position and diversify our market entrants into this domain. So, you have seen that we have in parallel from lithium to CCS, from hydrogen to geo energy and geothermal created ventures, each of them with potentially a different partner for addressing different industry sector, so that we diversify not only our approach, but diversify and expand our market reach. So that has been the first is to make sure that we diversify our investments, diversify our market approach and our type of partnership. So that has been our first, I would say, a framework that we have used to develop this. Now, what is ambition, there, ambition is to create the future of the company in the long run. So within the decade and within the next two or three years specifically, we will the risk and scale this technology investment these venture investments, working with our partners, working internally to develop those technology as we are for green hydrogen as well with our CCS Mendota bioenergy plant or with LarfargeHolcim for CCS on cement plant. We will work, develop, embark into ventures where we will de-risk enhance, and then when it is derisked at scale, we'll then make bigger investments, large investments that will then support the long-term growth. First, I think our push to do this is first and foremost performance. We believe that performance creates the revenue opportunity, the revenue quality and the margin expansions we believe that are the foundation of our strategy. So, now whether the market capacity in some basin for some specific business line we create the condition for pricing. I believe it will. But again, you will depend on how do we differentiate for performance. How do we make sure that our technology is unique and is in high-demand and create conditions for the customer to accept to a premium on this technology and that's our approach. Now whether the capacity will create in a short-term global pricing, I don't think it will, certainly in the coming quarters, create pricing inflection on some business line in some basin, we are already seeing it today in North America for very specific Well Construction technology that is in high demand and the amount of premium. Thank you. Good morning, Scott. No. First, I think we provided a guidance for full-year margin at 30%. And I think you have seen that the way we started the year is putting us on an excellent footing to realize that margin outlook, and this margin comes from two major factors. One is the performance of our integration contracts, and secondly, the strength and margin of our digital business. Now, going forward, and rolling into the later part of the year obviously, the digital will gradually start to improve its size and we'll create and generate the fall through that we believe will support this 30% ambition and could, as we exit 2021, clearly outperform and us on a better opportunity for margin expansion into 2022. So over time long-term the digital will indeed grow and we share that ambition there and we will clearly help continue to support these impressive margins and possibly expand it further in your long-term. Good morning, Sean. Yes, I think as you know for the last two years, I think we have been increasing our focus management and operational focus on resolving or improving this highly dilutive contracts that there were two or three years ago. And I think we have made great progress. I think whether they are exactly where I would like them to be, and accretive to the overall margin, maybe not, but I think we have made progress in three directions, first, in engaging our customer and making them realize the complexity and providing the support to execute this contract with better support and eliminating or mitigating some risk. Secondly, by adopting an accelerating adoption within this compact of fit-for-basin technology that is unique, and that we create for the long run an opportunity to set benchmark on those contracts hence to keep our market position and enhance our future execution. And finally, we have in the last few quarters, last few months actually, to roll out our digital operation capability to extract further automation, further efficiency on this. So we have improved, enhance customer collaboration on those contracts, we have created the technology portfolio that is starting to mitigate and enhance the operation execution. And we have rolled out unique digital features that are creating. So those conditions are unique, customer recognize it, and I think as we'll get the opportunity to renew this contract and expand would obviously look for making sure the commercial terms and the revenue quality will exploit in the future will be more accretive than they are today. Good morning, Connor. That's a great question. I think first, it's worth saying that the offshore basins and the most advantage offshore basins are still very much, very critical resource and core resource for some of our customers, I'll seize some unique NOCs and the few independent that are pure play offshore independent from relative medium to large size. So first these resource are precious, this resource typically have a good geology. And as I said, both from the production plateau, they provide and the low carbon opportunity they have in term of mix or API grade, I think these are excellent resources. The second thing I believe is that the economics for offshore due to integration success, FEED technology and digital practice have improved from the last cycle. And I think opportunity exists for industry to leverage this and accelerate some FID going forward. So, another factor that is very critical as you touch the exploration appraisal is that most of the major and large NOC on this -- in this context are recognizing the impact of exploiting hubs, offshore hubs and the offshore hubs, the opportunities is to exploit those hubs to improve the return on asset, improve return on infrastructure and focus on near field or backyard exploration, so that they maximize the return on existing infrastructure, existing FPSO existing platform. So, that it is also something that plays very well in our portfolio for configuring or for subsidy back as we are expanding this domain. So, I believe that the expression appraisal will not necessarily accelerating frontier exploration, but will accelerate the near field exploration offshore, and we're starting to see this this quarter and will accelerate during the second-half of the year. So I'm optimistic indeed on offshore and if you read some of the Rystad or IHS reports or some of the reports, highlighting the FID pipeline, and you see that FID pipeline that are already pre committed towards '22 '23 have the potential over '22, '23 and beyond to eclipse the last 2017, 2019 in terms of number of projects, but also in terms of total CapEx invested in deepwater. Yes, I think first the Production System I think is not only subsea system as both short and long cycle as exposure in short cycle in North America to the ESP which is coming back strongly and the Cameron surface equipment also servicing the frac and our partner Liberty and also internationally is indeed a mix of short for ESP and some completion equipment and long cycle for midstream as well as for subsea and surface equipment. So, it's a mix of long and short with very, very tangible exposure in North America benefiting short-term and long-term international long cycle both recovery and production new products. In that context and back to the point on offshore, I believe that the subsea market is very alive, and I think last year the number of subsidiaries were so short of 200 compared to higher than 50 in 2019. The prediction this year is to be above 200, 220 these are our prediction and that's align with the market prediction and this will be more or less increasing going forward gradually to be within between 250 to 300 over the mid-term period to support these offshore project. Thank you, Connor. Yes, Marc, thank you for the question. So indeed, our guidance, though, for operating margin expansion between 50 and 100 bps into the mid single-digit would still imply on the high end of that on that range 30-plus incremental [margin] (added by the company after the call). So, I believe that this is the first remark. The second is that we are still on track. Okay and very confident on our 250 to 300 bps full-year margin expansion. So, in the second quarter, indeed, there are two factors. One is the fact that you're mobilizing for what the offshore return and some of the activity that are prepping and mobilizing for the second half already in the later part of the quarter. But also there are some persistent but temporary COVID-related constraints and costs that as the lockdown are still in place in many countries that adding costs upfront, in to those mobilization and making this mobilization cost maybe a little bit more than they would have been in other cycles in the past. So these are the factors that are shaping up. But we're very confident that the margin expansion is in place and we continue going forward. No, it's a combination of facts. As I said, I think there are some market indicators from the CapEx of some of the NOC national company, there is rig counts projection that we're making based on engagement with customer and with rig contractor. And there are some markets position or market enhancements and contract award, we have been benefiting in the last few quarters. So the mix of our market position, favorable mix, the market expansion on international for that has an element of seasonal effect as well as re-investments. And the national oil company, increasing the investment in second half, all combined to make us more confident in where three months ago on the shape and inflection of this recovery in the second-half. Thank you very much. Last question... Okay, thank you very much. So, thank you. And to conclude, I'd like to offer three takeaways: First, the macro economic and activity outlook are increasingly supporting an attractive industry upcycle, characterized with an inflection in international activity, a consolidation of short-cycle activity, and the return advantage offshore plays, all playing to our core strength. In particular, we're increasingly optimistic about the international growth trajectory during the second-half of the year, which absent of a setback in pandemic recovery, will result in full-year international growth. As a consequence, we have reinforced our confidence in our 2021 financial targets on margin expansion, and free cash flow generation. Second, we're convinced that our performance strategy is aligned with a new industry landscape, and is increasingly resonating with our customer as performance matters critically in this environment. This is translating into market wins, particularly in the Middle East and offshore basins, and will support our ambition to outperform through this cycle. In addition, the steady progress in our digital strategy will translate over time in expanding new revenue streams and accretive margins. Third, the margin expansion realized this quarter both sequentially, and year-on-year is reflecting the impact of both our capital stewardship strategy and the restructuring program and will translate into substantial operating leverage as the year progress and activities strengthens in all basins. We anticipate the upcoming quarters to further this margin expansion with broad contribution from our Basins, and Divisions. Finally, our commitment towards both sustainability and New Energy is materializing in a growing portfolio of technology and ventures that will contribute to the global climate actions and to the future of the company. Ladies and gentlemen, this year represents a unique opportunity for the new Schlumberger to execute on its new performance journey and outperform the market within an increasingly attractive outlook. Thank you very much."

Later, there will be an opportunity for your questions. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, ND Maduemezia. Please go ahead.\nND Maduemezia: Thank you, Leah. Good morning. And welcome to the SLB fourth quarter and full year 2022 earnings conference call. Today\u2019s call is being hosted from Houston, following our Board meeting held earlier this week. Joining us on the call are Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Executive Officer; and Stephane Biguet, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind all participants that some of the statements we will be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and our other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our fourth quarter press release, which is on our website. With that, I will turn the call over to you, Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, ND. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on the call today. In my prepared remarks, I will cover our fourth quarter results and follow this with a quick review of our full year 2022 achievements. Then I will share some thoughts on the outlook for the full year. Stephane will then provide more detail on our financial results and we will open for your questions. To begin, we sustained growth momentum through the fourth quarter, delivering strong revenue growth and further margin expansion, both sequentially and year-over-year. The quarter was characterized by very strong activity growth in the Middle East and offshore and was augmented by robust year-end sales in Digital. Growth was once again broad-based and our operational, commercial and earnings performance was outstanding. We ended the fourth quarter with sequential revenue growth and margin expansion in North America and in all international areas. In the international markets, quarterly revenue topped $6 million for the first time in more than four years. Additionally, our international revenue growth rate has visibly outpaced the international rig count growth since the cycle trough in 2020. Service pricing, new technology and digital adoption all continued to trend positively. Looking broadly over the second half of the year, the pace of growth in North America significantly moderated. At the same time, international accelerated, growing in excess of 20% compared to the first half of the year, almost twice the growth rate of North America. We are clearly witnessing the start of a new phase of -- in the growth cycle, which will increasingly be driven by resilient international growth. This market dynamic led to a lower-than-usual cash flow performance at year-end. However, we further reduced net debt during the quarter and closed the year below our leverage target. Overall, these fourth quarter results helped us surpass our revised full year revenue guidance and we closed with EPS, pre-tax segment operating income and margins all at the highest levels in seven years. Switching to the full year, 2022 was pivotal for our industry and for SLB. It marked the second consecutive year of outperformance for the energy sector, providing further evidence of the multiyear upcycle and investment momentum that is underway. I would like to take a few minutes to reflect on what we achieved. We announced our new brand identity, with sustainability embedded in everything we do and opened a new chapter for the company. This firmly positioned helped SLB to benefit from the underlying macro trends that will shape the future of the energy, Oil & Gas Technology Innovation, Industrial Decarbonization, Digital Transformation and New Energy Systems. We executed consistently for our customers, achieving our best safety and operational integrated performance on record. We advanced our technology leadership and service quality differentiation, leading to more contract awards, higher technology adoption and increased pricing premiums. In our Core Divisions, we expanded pre-tax operating margins by more than 300 basis points. This was led by well construction, which expanded margins by more than 550 basis points. We also launched new products, services and solutions that increase efficiency and lower operational emissions. You have seen many examples of these in today\u2019s press release. Our Fit-for-Basin, Technology Access and Transition Technologies Portfolio have fueled growth and margin expansion in every division and every geographic area throughout the year. And we continue to strengthen our Core portfolio for growth and position for future resilience and returns with the acquisition of Gyrodata and the announced joint venture with Aker Solutions for subsea. In Digital, we had strong growth in Exploration Data, INNOVATION Factori and AI solution sales, and the adoption of our new tech digital platform is accelerating. We ended the year with more than 270 DELFI customers, more than 70% growth in DELFI users and our SaaS revenue more than doubled. These positive undercurrents combined with higher APS revenue, contributed to the Digital & Integration Divisions, expanding pre-tax operating margins by more than 170 basis points. We continue to build adjacent expansion opportunities for our Digital business, both in operations data space and beyond oil and gas, such as carbon management. And in New Energy, we progressed technology development milestones, established new partnerships, particularly in CCS, and made new investments that have created a focused, yet comprehensive portfolio that offers promising growth opportunities for the future. Today, this portfolio comprises five business areas, Carbon Solutions, Hydrogen, Geothermal and Geoenergy, Critical Minerals and Stationary Energy Storage, and we are accelerating our R&D efforts to develop technology solutions that address hard to abate industrial and power generation emissions. As you see, our three engines of growth are on solid footing and are positioned for market success. In sustainability, we reduced our own carbon emissions intensity in Scopes 1 and 2, and we continue to be one of the highest ranked companies in our industry across the four rating agencies. We also made significant advances launching SLB End-to-End Emission Solution or SEES, an industry first to help our oil and gas customers address methane and other greenhouse gas emissions. Finally, for our shareholders, we demonstrated our commitment to superior returns. We increased our dividend by 40% in April 2022, followed by a further 43% increase announced today and resumed our share buyback program this month. These achievements highlight a remarkable year for SLB and speak to how we have successfully leveraged the breadth of our portfolio and our competitive strengths to deliver peer-leading outcomes for our customers and shareholders. We are primed for significant success and look forward to carrying momentum into the year ahead. I would like to extend my thanks to the entire SLB team for delivering an outstanding year. Moving to the macro, we enter 2023 against the backdrop of market fundamentals that remain compelling for both oil and gas and low carbon energy resource. First, despite concerns for potential economic slowdown in certain regions, oil and gas demand growth remains resilient. The IEA forecasts that oil and gas demand will grow by 1.9 million barrels to reach approximately 102 million barrels per day. In parallel, markets will remain tightly supplied with modest production increases offset by the end of SPR release and well productivity declines in certain regions, most notably in North America. Second, there is a greater sense of urgency around energy security. This is resulting in new investment in capacity expansion and diversity of supply. You will see this reflected in the number of new projects sanctioned, gas supply agreements signed and the return of offshore exploration, all at a pace unforeseen just 18 months ago. And third, the secular trends of digital and decarbonization are set to accelerate, driven by significant digital technology advancement in cloud and AI, favorable government policy support in New Energy investments and increased spending on low carbon initiatives by operator globally. Underpinning everything, commodity price remained at supportive levels for durable investment. In North America, spending growth is expected to be more restrained after an exceptionally strong year in 2022. Capital spending growth is expected to increase in the high teens as rig counts potentially approach a plateau. Public companies, particularly the majors, are expected to increase short-cycle spending in key U.S. land basins and drilling activity remain strong to build up well inventory and support target production increase. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, where we have a significant presence, we expect the strong spending uplift to continue. Turning to international, markets are poised for strong growth in the Middle East and Latin America geographically, and more broadly, in offshore and in gas. In the Middle East, we expect record levels of upstream investments, with a ramp-up in various capacity expansion projects designed to deliver more gas production and a combined oil increment of 4 million barrels per day through 2030. Offshore activity will continue to strengthen as tiebacks and new development projects mobilize and new FID\u2019s are sanctioned, while Russian activity is expected to contract. Excluding Russia, customers\u2019 capital spending internationally is expected to increase in the mid-teens. The combination of long-cycle oil capacity expansion projects, offshore deepwater resurgence and strong gas development activity will be a key driver for the multiyear duration of this cycle. This outlook is very favorable for SLB with multiple paths of resilient growth in Core, Digital and New Energy. On a full year basis, our ambition is to grow revenue in excess of 15% compared to 2022, supported by the step-up in international and offshore momentum, which will augment growth established in North America. As a result, year-on-year adjusted EBITDA growth will be in the mid-20s driven by further margin expansion. More specifically, in the international markets, we foresee growth in the high-teens, excluding Russia, which is set to decline this year. We expect the highest growth rates to be realized in the Middle East and in offshore markets, particularly in Latin America and in Africa. In North America, we anticipate about 20% growth supported by offshore strength, land drilling activity and higher pricing. Full year margin expansion will be driven by further positive pricing dynamics, increased technology adoption and improvements from our enhanced operating leverage, mainly internationally. Let me share with you how we see this year unfolding. Directionally, during the first quarter, we anticipate a typical pattern of activity, beginning with the combined effect of seasonality and the absence of year-end product and digital sales. Additionally, the first quarter will reflect some impact of year-on-year Russia activity decline. This will be followed by a rebound in the second quarter and further acceleration of growth trajectory in the second half of the year, particularly in the international markets. This typical pattern of activity and the favorable dynamics I described earlier combine to support the ambition we have set for full year growth and margin expansion. In addition, the beneficial impacts of an earlier than expected reopening in China, the easing of inflationary trends and any further restriction on Russian exports could lead to an acceleration of short-cycle activity globally and fast-tracking of FIDs internationally. This could present further upside over the second half of the year. I will now turn the call over to Stephane.\nStephane Biguet: Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Fourth quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits was $0.71. This represents an increase of $0.08 compared to the third quarter and an increase of $0.30 or 73% when compared to the same period of last year. In addition, we recorded a net credit of $0.03, which brought our GAAP EPS to $0.74. You can find details of the components of this net credit in the FAQs at the end of our earnings press release. Overall, our fourth quarter revenue of $7.9 billion increased 5% sequentially and 27% year-on-year. All divisions posted sequential revenue growth led by Digital & Integration and Reservoir Performance. From a geographical perspective, North America revenue grew 6% sequentially, while international revenue grew 5%, led by the Middle East. Fourth quarter pre-tax operating margins of 19.8% improved 104 basis points sequentially and 393 basis points year-on-year. Notably, over 70% of our GeoUnits posted their best margins since 2016. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter of 24.4% was 219 basis points higher than the same quarter of last year, exceeding the guidance we provided at the beginning of the year. Let me now go through the fourth quarter results for each division. Fourth quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $1 billion increased 12% sequentially, with pre-tax operating margins expanding 386 basis points to 37.7%. This growth was driven by year-end exploration data licensing sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Africa. Increased APS project activity in Ecuador and higher digital sales internationally. Reservoir Performance revenue increased 7% sequentially, while margins expanded 146 basis points, primarily due to new projects and activity gains internationally, led by the Middle East and the offshore basins. Well Construction revenue of $3.2 billion, increased 5% sequentially, due to strong activity from new projects and solid pricing improvements internationally, particularly in the Middle East and in Latin America. Margins of 21% declined 50 basis points, as improved profitability from the higher activity in the Middle East and Latin America was more than offset by the onset of seasonal effects in the Northern Hemisphere. Finally, Production Systems revenue of $2.2 billion was up 3% sequentially on higher international sales of artificial lift, completions and midstream production systems, partially offset by reduced sales of valves and subsea production systems. Margins improved 32 basis points due to favorable technology and project mix. Now turning to our liquidity. Cash flow from operations during the quarter was $1.6 billion and free cash flow was $855 million. This performance did not reflect the increase we typically experience in the last quarter of the year as free cash flow was $200 million lower than in the previous quarter. This was due to a combination of the following four factors. First, we experienced extraordinary year-on-year fourth quarter revenue growth of 27%, representing incremental revenue of almost $1.7 billion. Second, our inventory balance increased 22% year-on-year to support our increasing product backlog driven by the sizable share of tender awards we have secured going into 2023. Third, we pulled forward certain investments in CapEx in order to fully seize the continued revenue growth expected in 2023, particularly in our Well Construction and Reservoir Performance divisions. As a result, our capital investments increased $255 million sequentially. Our full year 2022 capital investments were therefore $2.3 billion, as compared to our initial guidance at the beginning of the year of $1.9 billion to $2 billion. Despite this increase, the CapEx portion of our capital investments was still at the midpoint of our 5% to 7% of revenue target. Lastly, lower-than-expected year-end accounts receivable collections contributed to reduced free cash flow. As you may recall, we had exceptional cash collections in the fourth quarter of 2021. We did not achieve the same level of year-end collections as last year, and as a result, our DSO in Q4 2022 was approximately five days higher than at the same time last year. However, it is worth noting that our 2022 year-end DSO was the second best we have achieved going back at least two decades. Therefore, this is just a timing issue. Beyond free cash flow, our overall cash position was enhanced by the partial monetization of our investment in the Arabian Drilling Company, an onshore and offshore drilling rig company in Saudi Arabia. ADC completed an initial public offering during the fourth quarter and in connection with this IPO, we sold a portion of our interest in the secondary offering that resulted in us receiving net proceeds of $223 million. We currently have a 34% interest in ADC. We also sold an additional portion of our shares in Liberty, which generated $218 million of net proceeds during the quarter. We currently have a 5% interest in Liberty. As a result of all of this, we ended the year with net debt of $9.3 billion. This represents an improvement of approximately $400 million sequentially and $1.7 billion compared to the end of 2021. This also represents our lowest net debt level since the first quarter of 2016. Consequently, our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is now down to 1.4. In addition, our gross debt reduced by almost $2 billion during the year. We repaid in the fourth quarter $900 million of debt that matured and repurchased $800 million of notes that were going to come due in 2024 and 2025. As a result of our strong operating results and the net debt reduction, our return on capital employed for 2022 was 13%, representing its highest level since 2014. Now looking ahead to 2023. We expect total capital investments consisting of CapEx and investments in APS and exploration data to be approximately $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion, as compared to $2.3 billion in 2022. Based on this, our capital investments will grow at a slower pace than our expected revenue growth in 2023. As a result and when taking into account our 2023 guidance for EBITDA to increase in the mid-20s when compared to 2022, we are confident that our free cash flow will increase significantly in 2023. Accordingly, we reaffirm our ambition to deliver a minimum average of 10% free cash flow margin through the 2021 to 2025 period. This will allow us to continue increasing returns to shareholders as we leverage both the length and strength of the current growth cycle. Specifically, for 2023, we expect to distribute visibly more than 50% of our free cash flow to our shareholders between dividends and stock buybacks. Today, we declared the 44 -- the 43% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.25 per share, in line with our announcement at our recent Investor Day event. In addition, we have resumed our share repurchase program this month and are targeting a minimum amount of $200 million for the quarter. For 2023, we are targeting to return a total of $2 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Stephane. Ladies and gentlemen, I think we are ready for opening the floor to the questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Good morning, James.\nJames West: Hey. Good morning, Olivier. Good morning, Stephane. So I guess the first thing I wanted to touch on, Olivier, is the international business had a really strong second half, particularly strong fourth quarter. But from everything I understand and see in the market is, we are really just getting started with ramping activity, particularly in the Middle East, particularly in some of the offshore markets, but we are in the early stages of that and so there should be a further acceleration in international activity. I know you gave some guidance for 2023 in terms of what you are anticipating in terms of revenue and EBITDA. But how would you characterize the next several quarters we will see, of course, the normal seasonality in 1Q, but as we get into kind of 2Q, 3Q of next year, we should see kind of big volume increases, and then of course, price increases on top of that?\nOlivier Le Peuch: No. Indeed, I think, let me reframe a little bit of the guidance we shared.\nJames West: Sure.\nOlivier Le Peuch: As we see today, the combination of offshore Middle East and broad gas investments internationally will continue to support a very solid growth internationally. We are seeing -- as we have seen in the fourth quarter an uptick into the rate of growth for Middle East and that\u2019s driven by a commitment to oil capacity increase and further gas development. And this, as I commented briefly in my prepared remarks will lead Middle East investment to be on record ever as we anticipated in this year or next year. And as a result, will generate significant pull for our revenue going forward. But I think what I will say is that, what is characterizing international as we see it, is that it has a lot of resilience, because it\u2019s multi-pronged. It moves multiple engines, short and long, oil and gas, offshore and onshore. And I believe that the multiyear commitments for capacity expansion and gas development in Middle East is combining with offshore long-cycle, a return of deepwater, which is the operating environment that will see the most activity increase this year and also the return or the acceleration of exploration and appraisal offshore, which would be one of the defining characteristics of the quarters to come. So when you combine all of this, you are getting a very resilient multi-pronged and multiyear sustained growth pattern for the international market. And I think that\u2019s what we see and it will indeed support not only growth this year, but it will support year growth next year and the years to come and it will be multi-pronged and fairly broad and with multiple geographic impact.\nJames West: Right. That\u2019s exactly what we are seeing. So excellent there. And then maybe if I could hone in just as a follow-up on the offshore markets, because that\u2019s an area where Schlumberger has or sorry, SLB has an increased market share, it\u2019s also a high technology area of the business. Could you maybe talk through some of the things that are happening in offshore, shallow water plus really the deepwater area and especially what you are seeing in exploration and appraisal, because that\u2019s, as you said, the defining characteristic here and we haven\u2019t seen exploration in, well, a long time, so I\u2019d love to get your thoughts there?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. First, I think, to define, offshore has been, I think, seeing an uptick that started about 18 months ago. We don\u2019t see it abating and we see it continue to steadily grow. I think what is changing this year is that, whereas the shallow water environment was leading the growth to a large extent in the early part of this offshore cycle expansion. We are seeing the deepwater to catch up and including indeed exploration and appraisal activity that is set to visibly outpace international offshore activity actually. So deepwater will be the highest operating environment activity growth in 2023, and as part of it, exploration appraisal will be also outpacing and slowly rebounding. So it\u2019s visible in multiple regions and I think you have seen East Mediterranean with a couple of announcements by two or three major announcements of gas discoveries that are set to be appraised further and then for future development. You have seen some last year announcement in the South Africa and Namibia Basin that also get additional appraisal and future development. And you have seen that the East Atlantic margin and/or Suriname and Guyana remain very hot. And finally, East Asia is also seeing some deepwater gas exploration at the same time. So you have this four or five offshore mostly deepwater areas that are seeing exploration appraisal results of gas and oil, energy -- gas and energy security and oil - pursuit of oil reserve replacements by major and by national -- large national company. So I think this is happening. And this builds on top of the very high shallow water activity that has already rebounded and is set to further accelerate in the Middle East, where be it in Saudi and UAE or in Qatar, we have a combination of oil and gas offshore development plans that are in place. So offshore outlook is strong and is here to stay for years to come.\nJames West: Very good. Thanks, Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Anderson with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nDavid Anderson: Hi. Good morning, Olivier. So two things really kind of\u2026\nOlivier Le Peuch: Hi.\nDavid Anderson: Hey. Good morning. So two things really stood out to me today, I guess, the first was you calling this a distinctive new phase of the cycle, but also really kind of what it means for the duration of the cycle, what I\u2019d like to ask you about. So first, on the Middle East, it\u2019s clearly now taken standard stage. You have talked about a record level of upshoot in spending in the next few years. In a lot of ways, it\u2019s feeling like 2005 again. But I was wondering if you could talk about how this cycle could be different for SLB in this region for the perspective of the types of work you are performing, how are the contracts being tendered differently and really what that means for the pricing opportunity both within discrete services and integrated contracts?\nOlivier Le Peuch: No. Thank you, Dave. Let me comment first on your remark on durability. I really believe that the cycle that we have entered internationally, that is characterized now by the Middle East joining the growth engine if you like is set to be very durable. I think and the driver of that, as I said, is a combination of four or five countries having committed capacity expansion for oil production for the future and that are much in need as we can see that the tight supply is here to stay and to stretch the market and also for regional gas development and this is happening simultaneously in multiple countries. So this is set to happen and will not last one year. These are long-cycle offshore, onshore, gas, and some of it unconventional, and oil development. So this is first durability is here to stay and we are talking about years. And I think the targets are expanding anywhere from to 2027 to 2030, depending on the country, depending on the ambition they have on sustained capital production. So second is that what is quite unique and this is a combination of offshore, onshore, oil, gas, conventional and unconventional. I think you have the Qatar conventional gas development. It is only set to further increase. You have the unconventional development in Saudi and in UAE, you have the other gas development in the region, including the East Med that has a fundamental potential of East Med gas development. And then you have the mix of offshore, onshore that I think is quite unique, particularly on the rebound on the shallow water increase of activity you have seen. So that is unique and that gives us a unique opportunity to outperform and to use Fit-for-Basin to use our local content, use our customer centricity, and engagement that we have in the region, and to build on those market positions to really benefit and we are poised to certainly have record revenue in Middle East in -- during this cycle and eclipse previous 2014 peak by margin.\nDavid Anderson: And how are the contracts different, before -- last cycle I don\u2019t think we really talked about integrated drilling contracts or kind of LSTK contracts. I think it was mostly discrete services. So is that different today and how does that change sort of your business, I think, is there more opportunity\u2026\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think\u2026\nDavid Anderson: \u2026 is some more risk there as well?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think that what would characterize this cycle is performance. It\u2019s all about performance. And I think our ability to perform in this integrated contract, and as you have seen, what we have shared during this press release on the Jafurah contract and been able to up our performance to peer some of the North America performance and performance will dictate market allocation -- market share allocation and will dictate technology adoption. So our ability to Fit-for-Basin, our technology like we did in Qatar and other regions and local content like we are doing Saudi and other regions, I think, is giving us opportunity to earn this contract and to use a pricing premium for this technology adoption to deploy Digital and you have seen the announcement we made a few months back with -- in the sustainability platform with Saudi Aramco and more announcements will come. So we are building our future in Middle East on multiple engines, and we are building on the performance in execution. Technology adoption and differentiation and LSTK, while being a part of the landscape of the way we operate is not the largest piece of our business in the Middle East.\nDavid Anderson: Thank you. And just a secondary question -- second question just a follow-up on what James was asking about on the offshore side. Obviously, you feel confident in the duration, we are seeing this kind of shallow water business, which you didn\u2019t really have in the Middle East before. But thinking about the deepwater side, we are seeing rig contracting picking up materially. Petrobras, it seems to be cornering the market on deepwater rigs. So I guess my question is sort of similar to my other question, how is this different this time. Is the customer base changing much from what you see, is it going to be the same big players that we saw the last time and so is that changing much? And I am just sort of thinking that should we be expecting to see a bit more of a pronounced inflection in the second half of the year as deepwater comes on?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yeah. I think that\u2019s what we are predicting as well. I think, as I have indicated, the deepwater, we see the highest activity uptick compared to shallow and land, because land is being impacted by the activity compression and decline in Russia internationally and hence this is what we anticipate as well and we don\u2019t expect this to stop at the end of the quarter or next year. So this trend is set to continue indeed.\nDavid Anderson: Okay. Thank you.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you.\nOperator: Next we go to Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nChase Mulvehill: Hey. Good morning, everyone. So\u2026\nOlivier Le Peuch: Hi. Good morning, Chase.\nChase Mulvehill: Good morning. Obviously, you covered a lot of ground on kind of international, the outlook, the multiyear outlook, pricing momentum is starting to build and we touched a little bit on Dave\u2019s question here on offshore. So I kind of want to dig on -- dig into that a little bit more and talk specifically on subsea. We keep hearing a lot of anecdotes out there, some really strong margins that are starting to get booked in backlog. So could you speak to the subsea market, what kind of fundamentals you are seeing out there and I don\u2019t know if you are willing to kind of talk to -- if you think the industry, not necessarily Schlumberger, but if the industry can kind of get back to prior cycle peak margins on the subsea side?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I cannot comment on that industry. I think I can comment on what I see as activity outlook and what we see in our backlog and type of activity for subsea. So the undercurrent, if I was to use that terminology for subsea are very strong, because on the outlook, the mid- and long-term outlook, because of this deepwater activity that includes exploration appraisal and future development. FID -- offshore FID for 2023 is set to be the high since 2012, 2013, indicating that there is a pipeline of subsea activity in the horizon and we have seen some of it materializing in our work this year. We are seeing also some infill drilling, tieback activity, which benefited us in recent quarters and we are very reassured that the market is inflecting for further growth. And indeed, the conditions are set for price to be accretive into the margin, into the backlog going forward to build up and to resume some extent previous subsea margin. But I cannot comment on the industry at large, but I believe this is an industry that is very critical to the success of offshore development and where we see a lot of collaboration, engagement, technology development and critical technologies like subsea processing, boosting and trends are positive as we see it. And we are -- as you know, we made a strategic decision to align with -- to form a JV with Aker Solutions and Subsea 7 to address that market opportunity, and that this announcement reflects our view on the market.\nChase Mulvehill: Yeah. Absolutely. All right. And just one follow-up unrelated, if we kind of look at 1Q and just kind of think about the moving pieces, you walked through some of this with international seasonality. I didn\u2019t hear anything kind of explicitly on North America, but I don\u2019t know if you can kind of just step us through 1Q moving pieces between North America and international and maybe some color around margins?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yeah. First, because you pick on it, I think, I\u2019d like to first reflect on North America. North America has been a fantastic success in the last 18 months, 24 months. I think the rate of growth that the team has achieved both in offshore and land market has outpaced the re-growth visibly, the success in our technology offering and fit and tech access model that has been very successful there. I think as we expanded margin, as you have seen, our margin are the very, I would say, different, if not very accretive level today in North America. So this is a very good base to be on. And as the market 2023 unfolds, first there is a little bit of a shift to drilling to rebuild the DUC inventory that will favor us in a month and a couple of quarters to come before the usual plateauing or a moderation of growth in the second half. But we see an increased level of rig activity in North America, and clearly, on the momentum of -- and it\u2019s typically it happens in the early part of the year before it plateaus in the second half and that\u2019s nothing new. That\u2019s a pattern that we expect, hence it will have an impact on the first quarter. And then we see a continuation of the offshore strength and in -- be it in Gulf of Mexico, in east Canada or further North in Alaska and this activity set to continue to grow in 2023. So NAM will be indeed an engine that will support growth in the first half. And by contrast, as I said, the usual pattern of seasonality internationally in the Northern Hemisphere will be offsetting this and we will also this year have the effect of the Russia year-on-year decline that we expect to impact negatively. So you have a mix there that I think we have described and but NAM will be an engine of growth in the second -- the first half.\nChase Mulvehill: Okay. All right. Perfect. I will turn it back over. Thanks, Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you.\nOperator: Next we go to Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan Chase. Please go ahead.\nArun Jayaram: Yeah. Good morning, Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Good morning, Arun.\nArun Jayaram: I wanted to get your thoughts, Olivier, on the level of service intensity that you are seeing, particularly in the Middle East, perhaps, relative to the 2009, 2014 cycle, as well as thoughts on the spare capacity -- OFS capacity in markets like the Middle East and offshore?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yeah. I think let me reflect first on the indeed, the service intensity. I think the -- again, as I said, I think, there is a significant expansion happening at the same time concurrently and there is a significant focus on performance. So this has led to an increase of service intensity in the contracts where we operate. We are fully participating to this and we are leading on many of them based on our performance. But at the same time, we have much increased and much improved asset efficiency, and hence, we are able to deliver that service intensity, that performance focused delivery to our customer without increasing our CapEx intensity and we remain with our target of 5% to 7% total CapEx, as you have seen in our guidance today. So that\u2019s -- I think that\u2019s one aspect that I think is critical and we use that discipline in our CapEx, that capital to actually to indeed use this to help us extract and guide further up the pricing in the market. So the pricing is driven by, first and foremost, performance. As we see it, our performance gives us a premium, technology, a unique technology that either impacting performance or impacting decarbonization as transition technology or that is fit for the basin. And then, obviously, the stretch in the capacity market that is now being obvious and is being tested in the Middle East and in offshore is driving another undercurrent of pricing positive trends.\nArun Jayaram: Great. And just -- I want to follow up on this -- on performance. How -- Olivier, how are your key, call it, NOC partners differentiated in between performance, and call it, the lowest cost bid in terms of tender awards? Are you seeing more direct awards, but how is this -- how are the tendering process being impacted by this focus on performance?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think it has been a significant impact. I think if you look at the Kimberlite survey that has been just published. I think we remained the best performance supplier as indicated by the total survey based on technology, based on the delivery, service quality and operational efficiency that we deliver. I think this is recognized. This is leading to either of two things, I would say, direct awards or -- and ability to negotiate premium on our service pricing or technology pricing to reflect our differentiation performance. So the industry is measured by performance and we believe that we have set the benchmark and we continue to pursue collectively in our organization through technology, through a process in operational efficiency, through digital operation, so that we can extract this performance and offer it to the customer and they recognize it and give you the premium.\nArun Jayaram: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nScott Gruber: Yes. Good morning. You guys posted some pretty impressive margins in North America last year. Do you think most of the margin benefit overall and the share gain benefit within drilling services from your new strategy has now been captured, does there the market is going to stagnate here onshore for a period. I am just curious about your ability to potentially still deliver exit-to-exit growth onshore in North America or whether the benefits from a share perspective and from a margin perspective that had largely been captured?\nOlivier Le Peuch: No. I believe that the market has still room to grow. I believe first from the activity, as I described, albeit I think, it\u2019s very well known that the limited access to the Tier 1 inventory and acreage and the stretch on capacity in the market has created a negative inflection onto the well productivity. But we expect the major, the public to this extent and much less the private to drive the growth this year. In this market, we are well positioned, because we have a technology access model and Fit-for-Basin technology that has in drilling onshore made a performance impact and has been recognized hence has earned a premium. We have a production portfolio -- production system portfolio that is set also through our ESP or frac trees to succeed. So we see further runway both in growth and in margin expansion as the market is still stretched and similar to international market, the market recognizes the opportunity to differentiate to performance, particularly the public company. So our view is that in the North America both land and offshore. There is not only activity-based growth coming this year not to the same magnitude in land market like last year and still support also pricing, considering the stretch and considering the recognized premium on Fit technology and on performance and part and this is true both on land and on offshore environment.\nScott Gruber: Great. No. I appreciate all that color. And then just turning to Russia, you mentioned that Russian activity will be trending lower in 2023. Is that a market comment or does that apply to your activity in the country as well?\nOlivier Le Peuch: No. That\u2019s -- I think that\u2019s a market comment directionally and in line with some independent market analysts view. This is five to or single-digit to teens digit decline and we align with this view and I think our market activity will decline accordingly.\nScott Gruber: Got it. Appreciate the color. Thanks.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you.\nND Maduemezia: We can take the next call now?\nOperator: And it is from the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nRoger Read: Hi. Thanks. Good morning.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Good morning, Roger.\nRoger Read: I\u2019d just like -- I\u2019d like to come back to your positive commentary on the increase in the offshore and particularly deepwater. I was just curious to the extent you can share it with us kind of the way to think about the impact on Schlumberger, excuse me, SLB, as we go from kind of a conventional land rig, an international land rig, shallow water and the deepwater, right, like so what\u2019s the sort of multiple of revenues, potential margin expansion as you go across those?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yeah. I think we have commented this before and we have commented that offshore is an intensity of 5 times revenue intensity per rig and we maintain that view, whether this can expand depending on the intensity, depending on the market mix, depending on the pricing, I think is, I would say, a floor to some extent. But, yes, we see the deepwater accelerating and I think it\u2019s something that is not only in one region, but I think it\u2019s pretty broad. As I commented, it\u2019s Latin America, it\u2019s Africa, it\u2019s East Med and is to some extent also East Asia. Hence, this addition, I mean, we are not talking about necessarily 50 rigs, but one and twos and threes rigs in those regions. And the fact that they are relating to also a content of exploration and appraisal is creating a mix that is favorable in the quarters to come, I would say.\nRoger Read: Okay. And then my unrelated follow-up is to come back on the CapEx. Understand 2022 running a little hot and the growth rate a little slower in 2023 based on that accelerated CapEx. But what\u2019s the right way for us to think about CapEx as a percent of revenue, because for a bit, it seemed like kind of 5% to 6% running a little above that in 2022 and by my own calculations maybe still running above that in 2023. So I just wondered if there\u2019s been a change in how you are thinking about it or it just reflects market conditions as we look into 2023 in the middle of the decade?\nStephane Biguet: So, I think, you clearly have to distinguish the CapEx portion, which is directly correlated to the level of activity and the APS investments. So together as we guided, this is a total envelope for 2023 of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion. Within this, the CapEx portion, as we said, we will continue to target a range of 5% to 7% of revenue. So it allows us to flex it based on activity, but we will not go above this and it will be probably pretty similar to the percentage we saw in 2022.\nRoger Read: Okay. Great. So no change in how you are thinking about the investments and how that affects return on capital employed and everything going forward?\nStephane Biguet: No, no, no. Not at all. Still the same target range.\nRoger Read: All right. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question is from Luke Lemoine with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nLuke Lemoine: Hey. Good morning. You have\u2026\nOlivier Le Peuch: Good morning, Luke.\nLuke Lemoine: Good morning. You have outlined 2023 international growth and at your investor event kind of give us some parameters around 2025, but then your comments today about international growth could keep going through 2027 and possibly to 2030. I think we are all pretty familiar with Middle East, strong growth offshore as well, growing substantially, but what do you see as some kind of the later cycle growers or is this cycle mainly Middle East and offshore?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yeah. I think, again, to make sure we are clear on the commentary we have shared. I think I was specific about the later part of the year, the \u201927 to 2030 oil capacity and gas development commitments in the Middle East, okay? Offshore, similarly, I think, it\u2019s a typical development and FID that are being blessed and sanctioned this year and years to come, have three years to five years horizon. So combining the, what is expected to be the FID and dollar value in offshore environment in 2023 in the last 10 years with a pipeline is still strong going forward, we indeed expect three years to five years follow through on offshore from today and combining with Middle East, the rest, I think, is more related to short-cycle and it\u2019s difficult to combine. But I think these two major growth engines internationally, I think, have the potential to sustain a very resilient growth of international environment for years to come. Indeed, that\u2019s correct and that\u2019s hypothesis at this point.\nLuke Lemoine: Okay. Thanks so much.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you.\nOperator: Next we go to Kurt Hallead with Benchmark. Please go ahead.\nKurt Hallead: Hey. Good morning.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Good morning, Kurt.\nKurt Hallead: So, Olivier, I wanted to kind of follow up as you kind of laid out your financial targets back from your Analyst Day in November and it looks like you are very much on track to kind of meeting those targets. And I just want to get a sense now as we are kind of entering into 2023, you got -- are you getting a feeling that the market momentum in both international and offshore is even better than you thought it was when you laid out your plans for the Analyst Day in November?\nOlivier Le Peuch: No. I think, generally speaking, I think, directionally, I think, the market assumption we took, the macro backdrop we anticipated are roughly the same. I think I will only put two comments. I think first is that the dynamic of this year has, as I commented in my remarks, a little bit of an upside depending on the China economic rebound and opening and that could lead later in the year to upcycle and FID acceleration and that will have an uptick on the year outlook. And secondly, I think, the -- and I think building on the recent visit I had in the Middle East and the engagement I had with a lot of customers there. I think the strength of the -- and commitment to this capacity expansion and to this gas development program, I think, is here to stay and will be resilient to market condition, I would say. So I believe that the duration of the cycle, I think, we limited our guidance to 2025, but it\u2019s obvious -- becoming obvious -- increasing obvious that this cycle will expand and we will have the strength to expand growth beyond \u201825 both on offshore and Middle East growth engine that will materialize.\nKurt Hallead: Okay. That\u2019s great color. And then a lot of great information around your core businesses, just kind of curious now what -- if you could give us a brief outlook on what\u2019s happening on the New Energy side?\nOlivier Le Peuch: No. I think, New Energy, I am very pleased with the progress. I think we crystallized our strategy very much in the last six months. I think we have been commenting on it extensively during the Capital Market Day to outline the five selected domains in which we are investing in technology. We are investing in partnership, we are investing into equity and critical partners to accelerate our go-to-market, to accelerate our success. So continue to make progress on each of these five domains and we have seen some announcements relating to CCS, which I believe has a lot of momentum and we are involved into dozens of projects this year and we have crystallized and materialized some partnerships, including the partnership with Linde for blue ammonia, blue hydrogen and gas processing and we have been investing in RTI as well for carbon capture. And we continue to make progress and you have seen some announcement on Geoenergy with Celsius, which is a very critical technology that is being assessed and being recognized in Europe as something that could really have an impact as a new technology, as a new domain that could transform a little bit the way the heating and cooling of buildings and cities are done. So we have a great long-term outlook on this and more will come on this. But in general, we are making progress on each of these domains, be it in pilots, be it in early commercial contracts, be it in technology milestones. We will continue to inform you on these milestones so that you can judge the progress and continue to assess the potential and then keep us -- we will keep you informed on our journey towards 2030 and the mission we have to the next decade. So I am still positive and encouraged -- continue be encouraged with what the feedback we are getting for our partners and from our customers.\nKurt Hallead: Sounds great. No. I appreciate the color. Thanks, Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you. Thank you very much. So I believe at this time to conclude.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen\u2026\nOlivier Le Peuch: So ladies and gentlemen, as we conclude today\u2019s call, I would like to leave you with four key takeaways. First, our 2022 results represent another positive step in our financial and operational performance journey. Financially, we realized broad revenue growth and margin expansion, closed the fourth quarter with year-on-year EBITDA margin expansion ahead of our initial guidance and further reduced net debt. Operationally, the year was transformative, as we executed our strategy across our 3 engines of growth and communicated our new brand purpose and identity. This firmly positions SLB to be the leader in the energy sector across multiple opportunities and time horizons. Second, the macroeconomic environment remains highly supportive of a resilient upcycle in both oil and gas and low carbon energy solutions. This is fundamentally driven by demand growth amidst very tight supply and further boosted by the prioritization of energy security and decarbonization. These market conditions will continue to support steady growth in global oil and gas upstream investment for years to come and will prompt additional investments in low carbon energy solutions for a balanced planet. Third, the oil and gas industry is entering a new phase in the upcycle marked by the inflection in the Middle East and the strengthening of offshore activity. Taken together, this signals the onset of a new growth pattern internationally. These dynamics are closely aligned with our strengths and will enable us to benefit from a favorable pricing environment and further technology adoption. Additionally, we believe that the secular trends in Digital Transformation and decarbonization will only accelerate across all markets, presenting an advantaged position for SLB. Finally, based on our confidence in the strength of the upcycle, our favorable market exposure and strong financial results, we reaffirm our ambition to significantly expand shareholder\u2019s returns in 2023, through a commitment to more than double the returns when compared to 2022 through a combination of increased dividends and share buybacks. I could not be more satisfied with SLBs position at the onset of 2023 and have full confidence in our team\u2019s ability to fully seize the new phase of this upcycle and accelerate our investment for the future. We look forward to once again exceeding your expectations throughout this year. Thank you very much for your time.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Fourth quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits was $0.71. This represents an increase of $0.08 compared to the third quarter and an increase of $0.30 or 73% when compared to the same period of last year. In addition, we recorded a net credit of $0.03, which brought our GAAP EPS to $0.74. You can find details of the components of this net credit in the FAQs at the end of our earnings press release. Overall, our fourth quarter revenue of $7.9 billion increased 5% sequentially and 27% year-on-year. All divisions posted sequential revenue growth led by Digital & Integration and Reservoir Performance. From a geographical perspective, North America revenue grew 6% sequentially, while international revenue grew 5%, led by the Middle East. Fourth quarter pre-tax operating margins of 19.8% improved 104 basis points sequentially and 393 basis points year-on-year. Notably, over 70% of our GeoUnits posted their best margins since 2016. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter of 24.4% was 219 basis points higher than the same quarter of last year, exceeding the guidance we provided at the beginning of the year. Let me now go through the fourth quarter results for each division. Fourth quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $1 billion increased 12% sequentially, with pre-tax operating margins expanding 386 basis points to 37.7%. This growth was driven by year-end exploration data licensing sales in the Gulf of Mexico and Africa. Increased APS project activity in Ecuador and higher digital sales internationally. Reservoir Performance revenue increased 7% sequentially, while margins expanded 146 basis points, primarily due to new projects and activity gains internationally, led by the Middle East and the offshore basins. Well Construction revenue of $3.2 billion, increased 5% sequentially, due to strong activity from new projects and solid pricing improvements internationally, particularly in the Middle East and in Latin America. Margins of 21% declined 50 basis points, as improved profitability from the higher activity in the Middle East and Latin America was more than offset by the onset of seasonal effects in the Northern Hemisphere. Finally, Production Systems revenue of $2.2 billion was up 3% sequentially on higher international sales of artificial lift, completions and midstream production systems, partially offset by reduced sales of valves and subsea production systems. Margins improved 32 basis points due to favorable technology and project mix. Now turning to our liquidity. Cash flow from operations during the quarter was $1.6 billion and free cash flow was $855 million. This performance did not reflect the increase we typically experience in the last quarter of the year as free cash flow was $200 million lower than in the previous quarter. This was due to a combination of the following four factors. First, we experienced extraordinary year-on-year fourth quarter revenue growth of 27%, representing incremental revenue of almost $1.7 billion. Second, our inventory balance increased 22% year-on-year to support our increasing product backlog driven by the sizable share of tender awards we have secured going into 2023. Third, we pulled forward certain investments in CapEx in order to fully seize the continued revenue growth expected in 2023, particularly in our Well Construction and Reservoir Performance divisions. As a result, our capital investments increased $255 million sequentially. Our full year 2022 capital investments were therefore $2.3 billion, as compared to our initial guidance at the beginning of the year of $1.9 billion to $2 billion. Despite this increase, the CapEx portion of our capital investments was still at the midpoint of our 5% to 7% of revenue target. Lastly, lower-than-expected year-end accounts receivable collections contributed to reduced free cash flow. As you may recall, we had exceptional cash collections in the fourth quarter of 2021. We did not achieve the same level of year-end collections as last year, and as a result, our DSO in Q4 2022 was approximately five days higher than at the same time last year. However, it is worth noting that our 2022 year-end DSO was the second best we have achieved going back at least two decades. Therefore, this is just a timing issue. Beyond free cash flow, our overall cash position was enhanced by the partial monetization of our investment in the Arabian Drilling Company, an onshore and offshore drilling rig company in Saudi Arabia. ADC completed an initial public offering during the fourth quarter and in connection with this IPO, we sold a portion of our interest in the secondary offering that resulted in us receiving net proceeds of $223 million. We currently have a 34% interest in ADC. We also sold an additional portion of our shares in Liberty, which generated $218 million of net proceeds during the quarter. We currently have a 5% interest in Liberty. As a result of all of this, we ended the year with net debt of $9.3 billion. This represents an improvement of approximately $400 million sequentially and $1.7 billion compared to the end of 2021. This also represents our lowest net debt level since the first quarter of 2016. Consequently, our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is now down to 1.4. In addition, our gross debt reduced by almost $2 billion during the year. We repaid in the fourth quarter $900 million of debt that matured and repurchased $800 million of notes that were going to come due in 2024 and 2025. As a result of our strong operating results and the net debt reduction, our return on capital employed for 2022 was 13%, representing its highest level since 2014. Now looking ahead to 2023. We expect total capital investments consisting of CapEx and investments in APS and exploration data to be approximately $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion, as compared to $2.3 billion in 2022. Based on this, our capital investments will grow at a slower pace than our expected revenue growth in 2023. As a result and when taking into account our 2023 guidance for EBITDA to increase in the mid-20s when compared to 2022, we are confident that our free cash flow will increase significantly in 2023. Accordingly, we reaffirm our ambition to deliver a minimum average of 10% free cash flow margin through the 2021 to 2025 period. This will allow us to continue increasing returns to shareholders as we leverage both the length and strength of the current growth cycle. Specifically, for 2023, we expect to distribute visibly more than 50% of our free cash flow to our shareholders between dividends and stock buybacks. Today, we declared the 44 -- the 43% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.25 per share, in line with our announcement at our recent Investor Day event. In addition, we have resumed our share repurchase program this month and are targeting a minimum amount of $200 million for the quarter. For 2023, we are targeting to return a total of $2 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier. So, I think, you clearly have to distinguish the CapEx portion, which is directly correlated to the level of activity and the APS investments. So together as we guided, this is a total envelope for 2023 of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion. Within this, the CapEx portion, as we said, we will continue to target a range of 5% to 7% of revenue. So it allows us to flex it based on activity, but we will not go above this and it will be probably pretty similar to the percentage we saw in 2022. No, no, no. Not at all. Still the same target range."

            "content": "Thank you, ND. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on the call today. In my prepared remarks, I will cover our fourth quarter results and follow this with a quick review of our full year 2022 achievements. Then I will share some thoughts on the outlook for the full year. Stephane will then provide more detail on our financial results and we will open for your questions. To begin, we sustained growth momentum through the fourth quarter, delivering strong revenue growth and further margin expansion, both sequentially and year-over-year. The quarter was characterized by very strong activity growth in the Middle East and offshore and was augmented by robust year-end sales in Digital. Growth was once again broad-based and our operational, commercial and earnings performance was outstanding. We ended the fourth quarter with sequential revenue growth and margin expansion in North America and in all international areas. In the international markets, quarterly revenue topped $6 million for the first time in more than four years. Additionally, our international revenue growth rate has visibly outpaced the international rig count growth since the cycle trough in 2020. Service pricing, new technology and digital adoption all continued to trend positively. Looking broadly over the second half of the year, the pace of growth in North America significantly moderated. At the same time, international accelerated, growing in excess of 20% compared to the first half of the year, almost twice the growth rate of North America. We are clearly witnessing the start of a new phase of -- in the growth cycle, which will increasingly be driven by resilient international growth. This market dynamic led to a lower-than-usual cash flow performance at year-end. However, we further reduced net debt during the quarter and closed the year below our leverage target. Overall, these fourth quarter results helped us surpass our revised full year revenue guidance and we closed with EPS, pre-tax segment operating income and margins all at the highest levels in seven years. Switching to the full year, 2022 was pivotal for our industry and for SLB. It marked the second consecutive year of outperformance for the energy sector, providing further evidence of the multiyear upcycle and investment momentum that is underway. I would like to take a few minutes to reflect on what we achieved. We announced our new brand identity, with sustainability embedded in everything we do and opened a new chapter for the company. This firmly positioned helped SLB to benefit from the underlying macro trends that will shape the future of the energy, Oil & Gas Technology Innovation, Industrial Decarbonization, Digital Transformation and New Energy Systems. We executed consistently for our customers, achieving our best safety and operational integrated performance on record. We advanced our technology leadership and service quality differentiation, leading to more contract awards, higher technology adoption and increased pricing premiums. In our Core Divisions, we expanded pre-tax operating margins by more than 300 basis points. This was led by well construction, which expanded margins by more than 550 basis points. We also launched new products, services and solutions that increase efficiency and lower operational emissions. You have seen many examples of these in today's press release. Our Fit-for-Basin, Technology Access and Transition Technologies Portfolio have fueled growth and margin expansion in every division and every geographic area throughout the year. And we continue to strengthen our Core portfolio for growth and position for future resilience and returns with the acquisition of Gyrodata and the announced joint venture with Aker Solutions for subsea. In Digital, we had strong growth in Exploration Data, INNOVATION Factori and AI solution sales, and the adoption of our new tech digital platform is accelerating. We ended the year with more than 270 DELFI customers, more than 70% growth in DELFI users and our SaaS revenue more than doubled. These positive undercurrents combined with higher APS revenue, contributed to the Digital & Integration Divisions, expanding pre-tax operating margins by more than 170 basis points. We continue to build adjacent expansion opportunities for our Digital business, both in operations data space and beyond oil and gas, such as carbon management. And in New Energy, we progressed technology development milestones, established new partnerships, particularly in CCS, and made new investments that have created a focused, yet comprehensive portfolio that offers promising growth opportunities for the future. Today, this portfolio comprises five business areas, Carbon Solutions, Hydrogen, Geothermal and Geoenergy, Critical Minerals and Stationary Energy Storage, and we are accelerating our R&D efforts to develop technology solutions that address hard to abate industrial and power generation emissions. As you see, our three engines of growth are on solid footing and are positioned for market success. In sustainability, we reduced our own carbon emissions intensity in Scopes 1 and 2, and we continue to be one of the highest ranked companies in our industry across the four rating agencies. We also made significant advances launching SLB End-to-End Emission Solution or SEES, an industry first to help our oil and gas customers address methane and other greenhouse gas emissions. Finally, for our shareholders, we demonstrated our commitment to superior returns. We increased our dividend by 40% in April 2022, followed by a further 43% increase announced today and resumed our share buyback program this month. These achievements highlight a remarkable year for SLB and speak to how we have successfully leveraged the breadth of our portfolio and our competitive strengths to deliver peer-leading outcomes for our customers and shareholders. We are primed for significant success and look forward to carrying momentum into the year ahead. I would like to extend my thanks to the entire SLB team for delivering an outstanding year. Moving to the macro, we enter 2023 against the backdrop of market fundamentals that remain compelling for both oil and gas and low carbon energy resource. First, despite concerns for potential economic slowdown in certain regions, oil and gas demand growth remains resilient. The IEA forecasts that oil and gas demand will grow by 1.9 million barrels to reach approximately 102 million barrels per day. In parallel, markets will remain tightly supplied with modest production increases offset by the end of SPR release and well productivity declines in certain regions, most notably in North America. Second, there is a greater sense of urgency around energy security. This is resulting in new investment in capacity expansion and diversity of supply. You will see this reflected in the number of new projects sanctioned, gas supply agreements signed and the return of offshore exploration, all at a pace unforeseen just 18 months ago. And third, the secular trends of digital and decarbonization are set to accelerate, driven by significant digital technology advancement in cloud and AI, favorable government policy support in New Energy investments and increased spending on low carbon initiatives by operator globally. Underpinning everything, commodity price remained at supportive levels for durable investment. In North America, spending growth is expected to be more restrained after an exceptionally strong year in 2022. Capital spending growth is expected to increase in the high teens as rig counts potentially approach a plateau. Public companies, particularly the majors, are expected to increase short-cycle spending in key U.S. land basins and drilling activity remain strong to build up well inventory and support target production increase. In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, where we have a significant presence, we expect the strong spending uplift to continue. Turning to international, markets are poised for strong growth in the Middle East and Latin America geographically, and more broadly, in offshore and in gas. In the Middle East, we expect record levels of upstream investments, with a ramp-up in various capacity expansion projects designed to deliver more gas production and a combined oil increment of 4 million barrels per day through 2030. Offshore activity will continue to strengthen as tiebacks and new development projects mobilize and new FID's are sanctioned, while Russian activity is expected to contract. Excluding Russia, customers' capital spending internationally is expected to increase in the mid-teens. The combination of long-cycle oil capacity expansion projects, offshore deepwater resurgence and strong gas development activity will be a key driver for the multiyear duration of this cycle. This outlook is very favorable for SLB with multiple paths of resilient growth in Core, Digital and New Energy. On a full year basis, our ambition is to grow revenue in excess of 15% compared to 2022, supported by the step-up in international and offshore momentum, which will augment growth established in North America. As a result, year-on-year adjusted EBITDA growth will be in the mid-20s driven by further margin expansion. More specifically, in the international markets, we foresee growth in the high-teens, excluding Russia, which is set to decline this year. We expect the highest growth rates to be realized in the Middle East and in offshore markets, particularly in Latin America and in Africa. In North America, we anticipate about 20% growth supported by offshore strength, land drilling activity and higher pricing. Full year margin expansion will be driven by further positive pricing dynamics, increased technology adoption and improvements from our enhanced operating leverage, mainly internationally. Let me share with you how we see this year unfolding. Directionally, during the first quarter, we anticipate a typical pattern of activity, beginning with the combined effect of seasonality and the absence of year-end product and digital sales. Additionally, the first quarter will reflect some impact of year-on-year Russia activity decline. This will be followed by a rebound in the second quarter and further acceleration of growth trajectory in the second half of the year, particularly in the international markets. This typical pattern of activity and the favorable dynamics I described earlier combine to support the ambition we have set for full year growth and margin expansion. In addition, the beneficial impacts of an earlier than expected reopening in China, the easing of inflationary trends and any further restriction on Russian exports could lead to an acceleration of short-cycle activity globally and fast-tracking of FIDs internationally. This could present further upside over the second half of the year. I will now turn the call over to Stephane. Thank you, Stephane. Ladies and gentlemen, I think we are ready for opening the floor to the questions. Good morning, James. No. Indeed, I think, let me reframe a little bit of the guidance we shared. As we see today, the combination of offshore Middle East and broad gas investments internationally will continue to support a very solid growth internationally. We are seeing -- as we have seen in the fourth quarter an uptick into the rate of growth for Middle East and that's driven by a commitment to oil capacity increase and further gas development. And this, as I commented briefly in my prepared remarks will lead Middle East investment to be on record ever as we anticipated in this year or next year. And as a result, will generate significant pull for our revenue going forward. But I think what I will say is that, what is characterizing international as we see it, is that it has a lot of resilience, because it's multi-pronged. It moves multiple engines, short and long, oil and gas, offshore and onshore. And I believe that the multiyear commitments for capacity expansion and gas development in Middle East is combining with offshore long-cycle, a return of deepwater, which is the operating environment that will see the most activity increase this year and also the return or the acceleration of exploration and appraisal offshore, which would be one of the defining characteristics of the quarters to come. So when you combine all of this, you are getting a very resilient multi-pronged and multiyear sustained growth pattern for the international market. And I think that's what we see and it will indeed support not only growth this year, but it will support year growth next year and the years to come and it will be multi-pronged and fairly broad and with multiple geographic impact. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. First, I think, to define, offshore has been, I think, seeing an uptick that started about 18 months ago. We don't see it abating and we see it continue to steadily grow. I think what is changing this year is that, whereas the shallow water environment was leading the growth to a large extent in the early part of this offshore cycle expansion. We are seeing the deepwater to catch up and including indeed exploration and appraisal activity that is set to visibly outpace international offshore activity actually. So deepwater will be the highest operating environment activity growth in 2023, and as part of it, exploration appraisal will be also outpacing and slowly rebounding. So it's visible in multiple regions and I think you have seen East Mediterranean with a couple of announcements by two or three major announcements of gas discoveries that are set to be appraised further and then for future development. You have seen some last year announcement in the South Africa and Namibia Basin that also get additional appraisal and future development. And you have seen that the East Atlantic margin and/or Suriname and Guyana remain very hot. And finally, East Asia is also seeing some deepwater gas exploration at the same time. So you have this four or five offshore mostly deepwater areas that are seeing exploration appraisal results of gas and oil, energy -- gas and energy security and oil - pursuit of oil reserve replacements by major and by national -- large national company. So I think this is happening. And this builds on top of the very high shallow water activity that has already rebounded and is set to further accelerate in the Middle East, where be it in Saudi and UAE or in Qatar, we have a combination of oil and gas offshore development plans that are in place. So offshore outlook is strong and is here to stay for years to come. Thank you. Hi. No. Thank you, Dave. Let me comment first on your remark on durability. I really believe that the cycle that we have entered internationally, that is characterized now by the Middle East joining the growth engine if you like is set to be very durable. I think and the driver of that, as I said, is a combination of four or five countries having committed capacity expansion for oil production for the future and that are much in need as we can see that the tight supply is here to stay and to stretch the market and also for regional gas development and this is happening simultaneously in multiple countries. So this is set to happen and will not last one year. These are long-cycle offshore, onshore, gas, and some of it unconventional, and oil development. So this is first durability is here to stay and we are talking about years. And I think the targets are expanding anywhere from to 2027 to 2030, depending on the country, depending on the ambition they have on sustained capital production. So second is that what is quite unique and this is a combination of offshore, onshore, oil, gas, conventional and unconventional. I think you have the Qatar conventional gas development. It is only set to further increase. You have the unconventional development in Saudi and in UAE, you have the other gas development in the region, including the East Med that has a fundamental potential of East Med gas development. And then you have the mix of offshore, onshore that I think is quite unique, particularly on the rebound on the shallow water increase of activity you have seen. So that is unique and that gives us a unique opportunity to outperform and to use Fit-for-Basin to use our local content, use our customer centricity, and engagement that we have in the region, and to build on those market positions to really benefit and we are poised to certainly have record revenue in Middle East in -- during this cycle and eclipse previous 2014 peak by margin. I think... I think that what would characterize this cycle is performance. It's all about performance. And I think our ability to perform in this integrated contract, and as you have seen, what we have shared during this press release on the Jafurah contract and been able to up our performance to peer some of the North America performance and performance will dictate market allocation -- market share allocation and will dictate technology adoption. So our ability to Fit-for-Basin, our technology like we did in Qatar and other regions and local content like we are doing Saudi and other regions, I think, is giving us opportunity to earn this contract and to use a pricing premium for this technology adoption to deploy Digital and you have seen the announcement we made a few months back with -- in the sustainability platform with Saudi Aramco and more announcements will come. So we are building our future in Middle East on multiple engines, and we are building on the performance in execution. Technology adoption and differentiation and LSTK, while being a part of the landscape of the way we operate is not the largest piece of our business in the Middle East. Yeah. I think that's what we are predicting as well. I think, as I have indicated, the deepwater, we see the highest activity uptick compared to shallow and land, because land is being impacted by the activity compression and decline in Russia internationally and hence this is what we anticipate as well and we don't expect this to stop at the end of the quarter or next year. So this trend is set to continue indeed. Thank you. Hi. Good morning, Chase. I cannot comment on that industry. I think I can comment on what I see as activity outlook and what we see in our backlog and type of activity for subsea. So the undercurrent, if I was to use that terminology for subsea are very strong, because on the outlook, the mid- and long-term outlook, because of this deepwater activity that includes exploration appraisal and future development. FID -- offshore FID for 2023 is set to be the high since 2012, 2013, indicating that there is a pipeline of subsea activity in the horizon and we have seen some of it materializing in our work this year. We are seeing also some infill drilling, tieback activity, which benefited us in recent quarters and we are very reassured that the market is inflecting for further growth. And indeed, the conditions are set for price to be accretive into the margin, into the backlog going forward to build up and to resume some extent previous subsea margin. But I cannot comment on the industry at large, but I believe this is an industry that is very critical to the success of offshore development and where we see a lot of collaboration, engagement, technology development and critical technologies like subsea processing, boosting and trends are positive as we see it. And we are -- as you know, we made a strategic decision to align with -- to form a JV with Aker Solutions and Subsea 7 to address that market opportunity, and that this announcement reflects our view on the market. Yeah. First, because you pick on it, I think, I'd like to first reflect on North America. North America has been a fantastic success in the last 18 months, 24 months. I think the rate of growth that the team has achieved both in offshore and land market has outpaced the re-growth visibly, the success in our technology offering and fit and tech access model that has been very successful there. I think as we expanded margin, as you have seen, our margin are the very, I would say, different, if not very accretive level today in North America. So this is a very good base to be on. And as the market 2023 unfolds, first there is a little bit of a shift to drilling to rebuild the DUC inventory that will favor us in a month and a couple of quarters to come before the usual plateauing or a moderation of growth in the second half. But we see an increased level of rig activity in North America, and clearly, on the momentum of -- and it's typically it happens in the early part of the year before it plateaus in the second half and that's nothing new. That's a pattern that we expect, hence it will have an impact on the first quarter. And then we see a continuation of the offshore strength and in -- be it in Gulf of Mexico, in east Canada or further North in Alaska and this activity set to continue to grow in 2023. So NAM will be indeed an engine that will support growth in the first half. And by contrast, as I said, the usual pattern of seasonality internationally in the Northern Hemisphere will be offsetting this and we will also this year have the effect of the Russia year-on-year decline that we expect to impact negatively. So you have a mix there that I think we have described and but NAM will be an engine of growth in the second -- the first half. Thank you. Good morning, Arun. Yeah. I think let me reflect first on the indeed, the service intensity. I think the -- again, as I said, I think, there is a significant expansion happening at the same time concurrently and there is a significant focus on performance. So this has led to an increase of service intensity in the contracts where we operate. We are fully participating to this and we are leading on many of them based on our performance. But at the same time, we have much increased and much improved asset efficiency, and hence, we are able to deliver that service intensity, that performance focused delivery to our customer without increasing our CapEx intensity and we remain with our target of 5% to 7% total CapEx, as you have seen in our guidance today. So that's -- I think that's one aspect that I think is critical and we use that discipline in our CapEx, that capital to actually to indeed use this to help us extract and guide further up the pricing in the market. So the pricing is driven by, first and foremost, performance. As we see it, our performance gives us a premium, technology, a unique technology that either impacting performance or impacting decarbonization as transition technology or that is fit for the basin. And then, obviously, the stretch in the capacity market that is now being obvious and is being tested in the Middle East and in offshore is driving another undercurrent of pricing positive trends. I think it has been a significant impact. I think if you look at the Kimberlite survey that has been just published. I think we remained the best performance supplier as indicated by the total survey based on technology, based on the delivery, service quality and operational efficiency that we deliver. I think this is recognized. This is leading to either of two things, I would say, direct awards or -- and ability to negotiate premium on our service pricing or technology pricing to reflect our differentiation performance. So the industry is measured by performance and we believe that we have set the benchmark and we continue to pursue collectively in our organization through technology, through a process in operational efficiency, through digital operation, so that we can extract this performance and offer it to the customer and they recognize it and give you the premium. Thank you. No. I believe that the market has still room to grow. I believe first from the activity, as I described, albeit I think, it's very well known that the limited access to the Tier 1 inventory and acreage and the stretch on capacity in the market has created a negative inflection onto the well productivity. But we expect the major, the public to this extent and much less the private to drive the growth this year. In this market, we are well positioned, because we have a technology access model and Fit-for-Basin technology that has in drilling onshore made a performance impact and has been recognized hence has earned a premium. We have a production portfolio -- production system portfolio that is set also through our ESP or frac trees to succeed. So we see further runway both in growth and in margin expansion as the market is still stretched and similar to international market, the market recognizes the opportunity to differentiate to performance, particularly the public company. So our view is that in the North America both land and offshore. There is not only activity-based growth coming this year not to the same magnitude in land market like last year and still support also pricing, considering the stretch and considering the recognized premium on Fit technology and on performance and part and this is true both on land and on offshore environment. No. That's -- I think that's a market comment directionally and in line with some independent market analysts view. This is five to or single-digit to teens digit decline and we align with this view and I think our market activity will decline accordingly. Thank you. Good morning, Roger. Yeah. I think we have commented this before and we have commented that offshore is an intensity of 5 times revenue intensity per rig and we maintain that view, whether this can expand depending on the intensity, depending on the market mix, depending on the pricing, I think is, I would say, a floor to some extent. But, yes, we see the deepwater accelerating and I think it's something that is not only in one region, but I think it's pretty broad. As I commented, it's Latin America, it's Africa, it's East Med and is to some extent also East Asia. Hence, this addition, I mean, we are not talking about necessarily 50 rigs, but one and twos and threes rigs in those regions. And the fact that they are relating to also a content of exploration and appraisal is creating a mix that is favorable in the quarters to come, I would say. Good morning, Luke. Yeah. I think, again, to make sure we are clear on the commentary we have shared. I think I was specific about the later part of the year, the '27 to 2030 oil capacity and gas development commitments in the Middle East, okay? Offshore, similarly, I think, it's a typical development and FID that are being blessed and sanctioned this year and years to come, have three years to five years horizon. So combining the, what is expected to be the FID and dollar value in offshore environment in 2023 in the last 10 years with a pipeline is still strong going forward, we indeed expect three years to five years follow through on offshore from today and combining with Middle East, the rest, I think, is more related to short-cycle and it's difficult to combine. But I think these two major growth engines internationally, I think, have the potential to sustain a very resilient growth of international environment for years to come. Indeed, that's correct and that's hypothesis at this point. Thank you. Good morning, Kurt. No. I think, generally speaking, I think, directionally, I think, the market assumption we took, the macro backdrop we anticipated are roughly the same. I think I will only put two comments. I think first is that the dynamic of this year has, as I commented in my remarks, a little bit of an upside depending on the China economic rebound and opening and that could lead later in the year to upcycle and FID acceleration and that will have an uptick on the year outlook. And secondly, I think, the -- and I think building on the recent visit I had in the Middle East and the engagement I had with a lot of customers there. I think the strength of the -- and commitment to this capacity expansion and to this gas development program, I think, is here to stay and will be resilient to market condition, I would say. So I believe that the duration of the cycle, I think, we limited our guidance to 2025, but it's obvious -- becoming obvious -- increasing obvious that this cycle will expand and we will have the strength to expand growth beyond \u201825 both on offshore and Middle East growth engine that will materialize. No. I think, New Energy, I am very pleased with the progress. I think we crystallized our strategy very much in the last six months. I think we have been commenting on it extensively during the Capital Market Day to outline the five selected domains in which we are investing in technology. We are investing in partnership, we are investing into equity and critical partners to accelerate our go-to-market, to accelerate our success. So continue to make progress on each of these five domains and we have seen some announcements relating to CCS, which I believe has a lot of momentum and we are involved into dozens of projects this year and we have crystallized and materialized some partnerships, including the partnership with Linde for blue ammonia, blue hydrogen and gas processing and we have been investing in RTI as well for carbon capture. And we continue to make progress and you have seen some announcement on Geoenergy with Celsius, which is a very critical technology that is being assessed and being recognized in Europe as something that could really have an impact as a new technology, as a new domain that could transform a little bit the way the heating and cooling of buildings and cities are done. So we have a great long-term outlook on this and more will come on this. But in general, we are making progress on each of these domains, be it in pilots, be it in early commercial contracts, be it in technology milestones. We will continue to inform you on these milestones so that you can judge the progress and continue to assess the potential and then keep us -- we will keep you informed on our journey towards 2030 and the mission we have to the next decade. So I am still positive and encouraged -- continue be encouraged with what the feedback we are getting for our partners and from our customers. Thank you. Thank you very much. So I believe at this time to conclude. So ladies and gentlemen, as we conclude today's call, I would like to leave you with four key takeaways. First, our 2022 results represent another positive step in our financial and operational performance journey. Financially, we realized broad revenue growth and margin expansion, closed the fourth quarter with year-on-year EBITDA margin expansion ahead of our initial guidance and further reduced net debt. Operationally, the year was transformative, as we executed our strategy across our 3 engines of growth and communicated our new brand purpose and identity. This firmly positions SLB to be the leader in the energy sector across multiple opportunities and time horizons. Second, the macroeconomic environment remains highly supportive of a resilient upcycle in both oil and gas and low carbon energy solutions. This is fundamentally driven by demand growth amidst very tight supply and further boosted by the prioritization of energy security and decarbonization. These market conditions will continue to support steady growth in global oil and gas upstream investment for years to come and will prompt additional investments in low carbon energy solutions for a balanced planet. Third, the oil and gas industry is entering a new phase in the upcycle marked by the inflection in the Middle East and the strengthening of offshore activity. Taken together, this signals the onset of a new growth pattern internationally. These dynamics are closely aligned with our strengths and will enable us to benefit from a favorable pricing environment and further technology adoption. Additionally, we believe that the secular trends in Digital Transformation and decarbonization will only accelerate across all markets, presenting an advantaged position for SLB. Finally, based on our confidence in the strength of the upcycle, our favorable market exposure and strong financial results, we reaffirm our ambition to significantly expand shareholder's returns in 2023, through a commitment to more than double the returns when compared to 2022 through a combination of increased dividends and share buybacks. I could not be more satisfied with SLBs position at the onset of 2023 and have full confidence in our team's ability to fully seize the new phase of this upcycle and accelerate our investment for the future. We look forward to once again exceeding your expectations throughout this year. Thank you very much for your time."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Nd Maduemezia. Please go ahead.\nNdubuisi Maduemezia: Thank you, Leah. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Today\u2019s call is being hosted from Houston, following the Schlumberger Limited Board meeting held earlier this week. Joining us on the call are Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Executive Officer; and Stephane Biguet, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind all participants that some of the statements we will be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and our other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our third quarter press release, which is on our website. With that, I will turn the call over to Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, ND. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us on the call. In my prepared remarks today, I will cover three topics, starting with our third quarter results and our latest view of the macro environment. Thereafter, I will conclude with our outlook for the remainder of this year. The second half is developing to be one of the most exciting times for the company in the recent past. We started with solid results led by the international market and we continued to execute at a very high level, delivering another quarter of double-digit revenue growth with earnings per share and EBITDA at the high levels since 2015. In addition to the details captured in our earnings release this morning, I would like to take a moment to reflect on some of the key highlights for the quarter. To start, year-on-year revenue growth accelerated to 28%, the highest growth rate since 2011, more than a decade ago. Internationally, all areas grew and the pace of growth increased to 13% sequentially and 26% year-over-year. Activity and revenue trends confirm the onset of another phase in the global growth cycle, one that will be increasingly driven by the international and the offshore markets. Through our breadth and technology integration, we are optimally positioned to benefit strongly from the acceleration of activity that is expected in the quarters and years ahead. In our Core, all Divisions continue to execute very well and the impact of operating leverage and improving net pricing was reflected in our results. All Divisions in our Core posted margin expansion led by Well Construction, our biggest division, which posted over 400 bps sequential improvement. We also held our Digital Forum in Lucerne, Switzerland, bringing together captains of industry in energy and information technology, over 1,000 thought leaders, partners and customers. This year\u2019s forum was our biggest yet and marks an inflection point for digital. Our long-term competitiveness as an industry depends on our ability to effectively harness technology, data and deeper collaboration. During the 3 days of active engagement, it became increasingly clear to all participants that through digital, we enter the future better equipped to deliver higher value in terms of performance and decarbonization. In parallel, we also continued to strengthen our Core portfolio, increasing our opportunity set in the lucrative offshore markets. We announced an agreement to form a joint venture with Aker Solutions and Subsea 7. This agreement will bring together a complementary portfolio of technologies and unmatched integration capabilites to help customers increase production, improve efficiency, and meet their decarbonization goals. In the Core and in Digital, our technologies are increasingly being adopted and are positively impacting our customer performance. We secured several significant multiyear contract wins during the quarter and continue to build a solid pipeline of activity for the future. And finally, in New Energy, we continue to make significant advances building partnerships, investing and developing new capabilities. We announced an agreement with RTI International to accelerate the industrialization and scale-up of innovative non-aqueous solvent CO2 capture technology. We also made an investment in ZEG Power to accelerate the development of technology for clean hydrogen production from natural gas. Both of these are advancing our roadmap for hydrogen and CCUS. Recent policy enactments in the U.S. and Europe are supportive of our selected New Energy domains, technology-led approach and market growth opportunities. We expect to announce additional progress in the coming weeks and months as we continue to position the company for long-term participation across the entire energy value chain. To sum up, we entered the second half of the year with expectations for strong growth momentum and raised our revenue guidance for the full year. This was predicated on a robust international outlook, the strengthening of offshore activity and the broadening impact of service pricing improvements. I am very pleased with the evolution of these dynamics and our execution thus far, both of which continue to result in differentiated operational performance and solid financial results. I would like to thank the entire Schlumberger team for delivering another exceptional quarter. Turning now to the macro, we have strengthened our view in a multi-year up-cycle as we are on the cusp of yet another year of growth. Despite concerns over the slowdown of global growth rates and the potential for recession, the fundamentals for energy as a critical resource remain very constructive. First, in the near-term, a seasonal uptick in demand as winter approaches is pitted against a very intricate supply landscape for both oil and gas through the end of the year. This situation is exacerbated by the ongoing energy crisis in Europe. Looking further out into the horizon, the demand supply picture remains delicate with this imbalance amplified by geopolitics, increased instances of supply disruptions and limited spare global capacity. Second, the growing necessity of energy security and supply-source diversification will also bring \u2013 also drive urgent increases in energy investment. A significant step-up in investment is required to create supply redundancies, rebalance markets and rebuild global spare capacity to levels that provide for sustainable economic growth. And third, recent OPEC+ decisions and the extension of its framework for cooperation through 2023 are additional factors that will enable operation \u2013 operators to invest with a higher degree of confidence in their commodity price assumptions. Taken together, these dynamics will result in a supply-led upcycle, characterized by resilient upstream investment that is decoupled from near-term demand volatility. We expect investment growth will be durable, reinforced by the long-term demand trajectory, multi-year capacity expansion plans, lower operating breakeven prices and supportive commodity prices. Growth will be simultaneous in North America and in the international markets. This started first in the North America market and we are already witnessing the next phase of growth with an acceleration in pace, in the offshore and international markets that was very visible in the third quarter. In the U.S. land markets, we are participating more profitably in the more accretive and lower capital-intensive market segments, where our technology, performance premiums and our technology access business model are driving solid revenue and margins growth. In the international and offshore markets, we have increased market access and enhanced our participation across the value chain through a combination of portfolio actions, fit-for-basin technology and higher \u201cwallet share\u201d on account of our performance and integration capabilities. The next phase of global market inflection is expected to be driven by increasing activity in the Middle East. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect another quarter of sequential revenue growth and EBITDA margin expansion to close the year. Sequential growth will reflect historical seasonal trends. The international markets will be driven by a sequential uptick in the Middle East activity as capacity expansion projects begin to mobilize. Global Offshore activity will continue to strengthen, offset by the approaching seasonality in the Northern Hemisphere, while North American land activity is expected to moderate its growth trend. This combination will result in fourth quarter year-on-year revenue growth in the mid-20s and 200 bps EBITDA margin expansion when compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Against this backdrop, we will visibly surpass our previously raised revenue guidance for the full year. This updated outlook will wrap up what is set to be an outstanding year for the company. Looking further ahead, we have increased our conviction on our strategy and the growth opportunities across our three engines: the Core, Digital and New Energy. Constructive oil and gas market fundamentals, energy security and the need to accelerate the energy transition will support increased investments in both clean energy technology development and lower carbon oil and gas production. We have positioned the company to outperform in the long-term with multiple technology led opportunities across the entire energy value chain. These opportunities cover oil and gas, industrial decarbonization and new energy systems, all supported by digital transformation. We are ready to apply our technology, global scale and industrialization capabilities to lead in this energy landscape and deliver outstanding value for customers and shareholders. And finally, we will hold our Investors Conference in New York in a couple of weeks, where I look forward to seeing most of you. During this event, we will articulate our ambition for the future, including our near-term goals for 2023. As part of this year\u2019s Investors Conference, you will also have an immersive opportunity to see and touch some of our exciting new technologies and meet with members of our expanded management team. I am truly excited about this upcoming event. I will now turn the call over to Stephane.\nStephane Biguet: Thank you, Olivier and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Third quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.63. This represents an increase of $0.13 sequentially and $0.27 when compared to the third quarter of last year. This was the highest quarterly earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, since the fourth quarter of 2015. Overall, our third quarter revenue of $7.5 billion increased 10% sequentially. We witnessed a clear acceleration of growth during the quarter as evidenced by the 28% year-on-year revenue increase. Consistent with our expectations, activity shifted towards the international markets, particularly offshore. As a result, we experienced international sequential revenue growth of 13%, which significantly outpaced North America. Although we experienced volatility in certain foreign currency exchange rates across the world, the overall net effect on our revenue was negligible both sequentially and year-on-year. Turning to our profitability, pre-tax segment operating margins expanded 161 basis points sequentially to 18.7% and adjusted EBITDA margins increased 91 basis points to 23.5%. Margins also increased significantly as compared to the third quarter of last year, with pre-tax segment operating margins increasing 320 basis points year-on-year, while adjusted EBITDA margins increased 133 basis points. This significant margin expansion illustrates the benefits of the operating leverage and pricing momentum we have as well as our ability to manage inflationary headwinds. Let me now go through the third quarter results for each division. Third quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $900 million decreased $55 million sequentially, while margins were down 586 basis points to 33.9%. The effect of increased digital sales was offset by the absence of $95 million of exploration data transfer fees that we recorded last quarter. Reservoir Performance revenue of $1.5 billion increased 9% sequentially, while margins improved 209 basis points. These increases were driven by higher intervention and stimulation activity both on land and offshore. Well Construction revenue of $3.1 billion increased 15% sequentially, driven by strong activity growth both internationally and in North America as well as improved pricing. Margins expanded 403 basis points to 21.5% due to higher offshore activity, a favorable technology mix and solid pricing improvements. Finally, Production Systems revenue of $2.2 billion increased 14% sequentially, primarily driven by higher product deliveries and backlog conversion as supply chain logistics constraints continued to ease. The revenue increase was led by international markets, which grew 17% sequentially. As a result, margins returned to double-digits, increasing sequentially by 142 basis points to 10.4%, their highest level since the third quarter of 2019. Now turning to our liquidity. During the quarter, we generated $1.6 billion of cash flow from operations and free cash flow of $1.1 billion. This performance represents a significant improvement compared to the first half of the year as working capital started to unwind during the quarter despite the sequential revenue growth. Consistent with historical seasonal patterns, we expect this trend to accelerate in the fourth quarter, resulting into free cash flow improving sequentially. During the quarter, we made capital investments of just over $500 million. This amount includes CapEx and investments in APS projects and exploration data. For the full year of 2022, we are expecting capital investments to be approximately $2.2 billion as we continue to support very strong revenue growth, particularly in our Well Construction and Reservoir Performance divisions. Net debt improved by $1.3 billion during the quarter to end at $9.7 billion. This level of net debt represents a $2.7 billion improvement compared to the same period last year. Our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is now down to 1.6x and we expect it to drop even further during the fourth quarter on a combination of higher earnings and improved free cash flow. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Stephane. And ladies and gentlemen, I think we are ready for the Q&A session.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of James West with Evercore ISI.\nJames West: Hey, good morning, Olivier and Stephane.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Good morning.\nStephane Biguet: Good morning, James.\nJames West: So Olivier, I wanted to touch on the biggest business right now, which is your Core and the fact that it\u2019s strengthening so significantly, but it\u2019s also - the core has changed over the last several years. I\u2019d love to hear kind of your thoughts on how the next \u2013 maybe not the next quarter, but the next couple of years should play out for the Core business given where the cycle is going, how it\u2019s heading internationally, how it\u2019s heading offshore and how Schlumberger has positioned itself for where the increased capital spending will be?\nOlivier Le Peuch: No, I think I would like to comment qualitatively on the strength and the power of the Core. First and foremost, I think it\u2019s built on the two critical foundations. One is performance. Performance matters in this industry and performance gives us differentiation. I think here from our technology reliability, from the competency of our people and the way we remote digitally control and monitor operations, we are leading and we are recognized as such in the industry. The second is our customer intimacy. Our customer intimacy coming from the geographical basins and engagement we have that give us opportunity to deliver this fit-for-basin technology that are creating a unique differentiator and creating loyalty with our customers. So I believe these are the foundations. Now the delivery comes from our integration, our technology and our people competency and field operation. When you combine this and we have done that for decades, but I think \u2013 and when the market comes with higher revenue intensity in offshore markets and in unique projects where integration matters and technology mix and impact and create value for the customer, we see more adoption of our technology. We see more market share consolidation, and we see and recognize more pricing premium. So we see this trend to continue as the international market, the offshore market, the Middle East is the next leg of growth internationally. And we believe that the adjustment we did in our portfolio, the high grading we did in North America to tune the portfolio to be fit and focused on the capital light and technology differentiation, and this, combined with international footprint and strength we have retained, I think, give us a unique set of benefits as the market continues to unfold going forward.\nJames West: Okay, great. That\u2019s very helpful, Olivier. And then maybe a follow-up for me on the Digital side of your business, obviously, a successful forum in Lucerne recently. I kind of have my own kind of takeaways, I guess, from the event and the things that were announced during the event, but I\u2019d love to hear kind of your takeaways of the level of success? How you think it went, how you see the adoption playing out of Digital?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think it was, obviously, as we said, not only the biggest yet, but the most successful yet, event on the back of multiple factors. The first, the quality and level of the audience that did participate to this on both our strategic partners and our customers that made the effort to attend and engage to the event and all agreed that this event was a defining moment for them and they believe for the industry as it created an inflection point in recognizing the value of digital in performance impact, in decarbonization and in the efficiency going forward for the industry, building as a factor of resiliency and performance for the long-term for the industry. So I think that\u2019s the highest takeaway. Now the other key ability we have is \u2013 and we had is that we had a product acknowledgment from the customers that were attending and from customers that were watching while it was happening that \u2013 our platform and our ecosystem with the partners we have created around our platform is becoming very mature and is delivering value and has already been improving its worth for many, many customers. So the buzz around the success of the platform and the value from subsurface to surface to remote operation or digital operation has been recognized, and this will call for more success. So I believe we\u2019re at an inflection point in the adoption and we are seeing it through the different contracts, and you have seen some of them that are coming through in the press release, and you will see more coming \u2013 in the coming months and quarters that reflect the adoption at scale of our solution and it\u2019s not only subsurface. It\u2019s not only this domain, it\u2019s expanding. And I think the announcement we made with Microsoft to offer an Enterprise Data Solution and the first commercial solution on OSDU is making an impact. Similarly, the announcement we made with Aker on the Cognite data foundation to expand and provide the only subsurface to operation integrated ecosystem for workflows and interoperability is unique. So the adoption is about to scale. And finally, you have seen that we also announced that the power of our platform has attracted the commitments and the collaboration with Saudi Aramco to go beyond upstream and to create a platform for carbon management. So I believe the table is set for success, if I may, going forward, and you will start to see this, this quarter and in the years to come.\nJames West: Very good. Thanks, Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Welcome.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Anderson with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nDavid Anderson: Hi, good morning, Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Good morning, David.\nDavid Anderson: I want to ask you about service intensity. Something that jumped out in the release to me was you said that international revenue is already exceeding 2019 levels put on a 25% lower rig count. My question is what\u2019s changed so much over the last 3 or 4 years? It seems to be increasing service intensity. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s pricing at least not yet, so is it more technology being used? Is it a reversal of efficiency gains? And where is this most prevalent in your business \u2013 is it Well Construction where it\u2019s most prevalent? Just help me understand the service intensity patterns you\u2019re seeing.\nOlivier Le Peuch: You\u2019re correct. And I think the \u2013 as part of the mix as well, the international has made a comeback ahead of other basins. And you will see the next leg of growth coming from Middle East activity in the coming quarters, but I think that\u2019s one factor. But I think technology to deliver performance, our customers are more focused on critical assets where they want execution, and they want performance enhancements and higher return on their capital, lower cost, higher return, but this translates into higher adoption of field technology, adoption of digital technology and the power of integration. So, when we have the power of integration technology adoption and are increasingly being recognized for performance and some of it through contracts that are performance-based, I think we are gaining recognition and we are, in effect, creating a net increase in the intensity of service, but also a net pricing impact. And I think that pricing has many, many dimensions, it comes from a mix of adoption of technology. It comes from the performance that \u2013 for which we are getting commercial contracts recognized and share the value of the performance it creates. And it comes from pricing \u2013 catalog pricing, as I would say, the combination of which is creating a net effect that we have been benefiting from. And indeed, particularly in Well Construction, where I think the breadth of capacity we have that is unique across the industry. The track record of benchmark of performance, the competence of our people, the digital operation transformation we did, all have impacted our cost of service delivery for one, have impacted the performance we have created for our customers and as such has created the service intensity that is creating higher earnings.\nDavid Anderson: And then just sticking on the Well Construction business, you also said \u2013 and you noted in the release that a lot of the growth so far this year has come out of North America and Latin America. It was interesting that Middle East, Asia has actually lagged. With everything you\u2019re talking about with the Middle East, should we be expecting this trend to kind of reverse next year? Should we expect Well Construction to be sort of the leader \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, should Middle East be the leader in Well Construction next year? And you hit another level of margins this quarter, should we expect those margins to continue to go higher as this mix shifts more into the Middle East?\nOlivier Le Peuch: That\u2019s a fair hypothesis going forward. I think the Middle East has been lagging the growth and the rebound primarily due to the some of the constraint on the short cycle over the last 18 months due to OPEC+, but I think the four or five countries that have set some new expansion plans have \u2013 initiated this expansion plan in the second half and are set to accelerate their expansion plan going forward. I think it includes Saudi, it includes UAE, Kuwait, Iraq and what has been the first to expand, which is Qatar, on the LNG commitment towards 2027 will continue to expand as well. So I think the combination of this will create a new leg of growth next year internationally, and we will be set to benefit from it across all the divisions.\nDavid Anderson: Fantastic. Thank you.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question is from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nChase Mulvehill: Thanks. Good morning, everybody. I guess maybe follow-up\u2026\nOlivier Le Peuch: Good morning.\nChase Mulvehill: Good morning, Olivier. A quick follow-up to Dave\u2019s question around pricing or I guess maybe some of your earlier comments around pricing. I\u2019d like to flesh that out a little bit more. And think about kind of international pricing and the potential momentum that this could see this cycle. And me, personally, I think that investors are underestimating the potential pricing momentum that international could see this cycle. I think that people forget what discipline in market consolidation and higher barriers to entry can actually do for pricing. And obviously, international ticks all those boxes. And then we haven\u2019t invested in international, our OFS companies haven\u2019t in almost a decade. So it seems like there is a recipe for rather quickly tightening of fundamentals in a real pricing cycle in international. So I just kind of be curious your thoughts what you\u2019re seeing on pricing and kind of as we look forward over the next couple of years, what are your expectations on fundamental tightness that could drive some real pricing momentum?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Well, I think we are seeing this already today. And I think we have pricing impact started, as I said, 2 years ago, 1.5 years ago in North America and has been broadening, has been very visible internationally in the last quarter. So the \u2013 all the fundamental elements for - are in place, indeed. First and foremost, I think the capital discipline that we have in our organization is remaining firmly in place. Capital stewardship is clear, to us, and we deploy an asset in the contract and in the market to be accretive to our returns. The service intensity also considering the deployment of more offshore rigs is also increasing the pull on the existing net pool of resource technology that is getting further stretched on the demand of supply in our capacity. And finally, as I said earlier, the performance factor on the base foundation of our operations, be it our Core performance, be it technology that are fit for basin and are creating a performance premium for our customers or digital - operation of digital portfolio that we are rolling out are all creating a performance impact that the customers are looking for. Customers are willing to develop and are keen to develop their assets, provided that we develop them \u2013 if we help them develop them efficiently at lower capital intensity and with beating the curve and creating new performance benchmark. And I think this has a price and I think we differentiate in this environment. So we expect the future, indeed, internationally to support this pricing and these market conditions.\nChase Mulvehill: Okay. Awesome. I appreciate the color. Unrelated follow-up, if we can kind of go to the subsea business and just kind of maybe a state of the union update, just kind of general market outlook, pricing is starting to move. Maybe I don\u2019t know if there is any updates on kind of where margins \u2013 subsea margins are today? And how much margin expansion you might be able to see over the coming year or 2?\nOlivier Le Peuch: No, as we commented earlier, and we commented in making of our subsea JV, and we addressed some of this as in previous communication, we are very constructive into the deepwater market going forward. The recent pipeline of FID that has been blessed in recent months, the pipeline that is set in 2023 according to Wood Mack is at $170 billion of FID that will be the highest in the last 10 years since 2011. And the mobilization of projects across the different deepwater basins continues. There are some critical and very positive trends in Brazil, in Norway, Guyana continue to be and that Latin America basin with still some appraisal both from the Columbia gas offshore or the Suriname will be complemented by further activity in Africa and also in Asia. So we are positive on the outlook. The number of trees is growing and has grown visibly to now exceed 300 trees. And these are \u2013 this is setting the market condition for supporting higher price and again, linked to performance in life cycle reduction, performance emerging in reservoir recovery using boosting and processing technology that are becoming increasingly critical. And hence, we believe the conditions are set to be positive for the deepwater partly for subsea market.\nChase Mulvehill: Alright. Perfect. Appreciate the color. I will turn it back over. Thanks, Olivier.\nOperator: Next, we go to Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nArun Jayaram: Hey, good morning, Olivier. I wanted to \u2013 perhaps if you could elaborate a little bit more on Well Construction. Your margins grew 400 basis points sequentially. Maybe you could elaborate on just the drivers of the margin expansion and help put some of the results at Well Construction into historical context with the top line at above $3 billion in terms of 3Q?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think it\u2019s a combination where we are obviously extremely pleased with the performance of Well Construction during the last quarter, but not only during the last quarter. I think it has been a division that has been on a journey for the last few years, where we realized that we had the opportunity to put together the best and the biggest portfolio and the most comprehensive breadth of capabilities across the technology portfolio for Well Construction. We adjusted and changed the structure and the organization to combine all of this in one division, less than 3 years ago and about 2 years ago, and we are reaping the benefit from this, both from a technology adoption, from performance in integration, and from customer intimacy, giving us opportunity to expand our market access and expand our success and then critically creating the pricing impact and the earnings impact we want. So part of this, we have fit-for-basin technology that have created a unique performance impact and recognized as such. We have digital operations that we are increasingly using to impact the performance and the accuracy of our well placements and the efficiency of our operations as such, reducing our cost of service delivery. And we continue to introduce, as we said, technology that are making an impact and a difference on the market. So we are positive for the outlook. It\u2019s the biggest division. It has and will continue to lead in the Core going forward. And we remain very, very optimistic about the outcome, and we believe that the customers recognize the performance and look forward using and adopting Well Construction.\nArun Jayaram: Great. Just a follow-up. One of the sources of upside versus our model was the revenue growth in Europe/CIS/Africa. I was wondering if you could help us understand, I think an over 20% increase in sequential revenues, drivers of 3Q and thoughts as we enter into fourth quarter in terms of that broader region?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think it\u2019s \u2013 it was mostly offshore. It was driven by significant contracts that we have been executing in offshore environment, in Europe, in the Black Sea, in Norway, in Africa, a rebound of operations. I think the mix has been highly favorable, and this is the power of our Core and including Well Construction that has been played out very well. We have many contracts that we have announced, and we have been communicating earlier like the Ormen Lange project. I think we had some progress there. We have our Black Sea deepwater project, and we have more that have been combining to create much impact on Production Systems and Well Construction during the quarter.\nArun Jayaram: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOlivier Le Peuch: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Our next question is from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNeil Mehta: Good morning team and looking forward to seeing you here in a couple of weeks. I guess we will talk a lot about strategy then, so maybe some tactical questions for you. As you think about fourth quarter considerations, it sounds like margins and top line are going to be improving, but can you just give us any color on how you think about the sequential 3Q to 4Q across business lines as it comes to earnings? And then the follow-up is on working capital. You had made a comment that you expect it to accelerate into the fourth quarter. Any comments there would be great.\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think first, I think I have been sharing in my prepared remarks, some guidance that\u2019s comparing the fourth quarter to the fourth quarter of last year with mid-20s revenue growth and 200 bps EBITDA expansion. And I think from the geography of business lines, I would only comment that we see an uptick in Middle East to materialize, and we expect digital to further accelerate and to reflect the year-end sales that we typically have. So, it\u2019s a positive outlook, continued growth, both internationally and in North America and margin expansion to set to continue its very successful journey.\nNeil Mehta: And then on working capital, you start to see some of that release come up in this quarter, but just how should we think about that here over the next couple of quarters?\nStephane Biguet: Yes. Neil, as you saw, indeed the working capital improved quite a bit in the third quarter, this is how we predicted and it resulted into strong free cash flow. Going into Q4, you will see this accelerate as we typically see at the end of the year. So, working capital will continue to unwind and free cash flow will continue to increase. We have typically, at the end of the year, higher customer collections. We have the effect of higher product deliveries, reducing inventory. So, this is what we expect.\nNeil Mehta: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we go to Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nScott Gruber: Yes. Good morning.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Good morning.\nScott Gruber: I had a question on digital, one aspect that appears to be underappreciated is just the time required to migrate onto the DELFI system. While you get paid for the migration process, I imagine that the margins are definitely better than the deployment phase, so is it accurate to say that after a few years of selling the platform and undertaking the migration process for customers, are you coming upon an inflection point just in terms of getting customers utilizing the system and transitioning to the data consumption phase? Kind of where are we at in that process?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think it\u2019s a very good observation. I think we expect indeed that the journey of digital transformation for our customers will take time. And I think it\u2019s a long tail of transformation. We expect that will impact our results for a decade to come, I would say. However, we are indeed observing an inflection point that is reflecting onto the maturity of our platform and to the acceptability of this platform as the most effective platform that the customers have seen in terms of impacting their life cycle reduction, impacting the productivity of their asset team and providing them access to cloud computing resources and to digital operation capability that is not available to them today. So, we are seeing the adoption of our customers. We mentioned in the past that we have a baseline of 1,500 customers that are currently using our digital solution and our previous software suite of products. And we believe that we are today between 200 and 300 of those customers about 20% of these that have already adopted and have started to move and transition onto the platform, and we expect this to accelerate both in number of customers, but also into the expansion these customers are using \u2013 the way they are using our platform and expanding the workflows, expanding the scope, indeed, adding the data enterprise solution as a necessity to go and reset and transform their data infrastructure and then adopting workflows from subsurface workflows to operational workflows. So, there are multiple dimensions, complete intensity dimension, workflow dimension and customer \u2013 number of customer dimension that we are set to benefit for the years ahead.\nScott Gruber: Great. I appreciate all that color. And then switching gears to the New Energy portfolio and decarbonization. You guys have been active in building out that New Energy portfolio, while at the same time developing solutions and partnerships to help drive decarbonization of the oil and gas industry itself. Olivier, can you just compare the commercial opportunity of the two? I would surmise that the commercial opportunity on the decarbonization front is greater over the next 5 years versus New Energy, but I wanted to hear your perspective?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think it\u2019s both. We believe that there is a compelling event and accompanying need and utmost priority for the oil and gas to decarbonize itself. It comes into the engagement we have and the success we are having with energy transition technology portfolio to reduce the carbon footprint or the Scope 1 and 2 of our customers. It comes in bright lights with the portfolio we have created, the SEES portfolio, end-to-end emission management for methane, in particular and getting more traction and more success with this portfolio. So, I believe that this is happening at scale, and our customers are turning into a clear, I would say, initiative \u2013 set of initiatives to reduce the oil and - the carbon footprint of their operations and to target a lower carbon oil and lower carbon gas production. So, this is the first trend, and this is happening at scale and this will include CCS opportunities that we are developing as well in parallel. On the side of this, there is a lot happening into the clean energy \u2013 and I believe that you have seen some announcement in the IRA. You have seen some announcement in the REPowerEU that are aligned with the domains we have selected, the \u2013 be it geoenergy for efficiency, be it critical mineral to lithium, or be it hydrogen with getting credits at large, and obviously, CCS with the 45Q improving to help us address not only the CCS opportunity to - that are close to our oil and gas customers, but also the ones that are close to hard-to-abate sectors. So, I believe that I will not try to contrast both, I will more recognize that both represent huge opportunity of growth, existing customers and with new customers and that we are set to grow and build opportunity on both.\nScott Gruber: Got it. Appreciate the color. Thank you.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you.\nOperator: Next we will go to Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nRoger Read: Yes. Good morning. Congratulations here on the quarter.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Good morning.\nRoger Read: Look forward to seeing you all in a couple of weeks. I guess what I wanted to ask is two different things. One, as you look at the margins and obviously, that\u2019s one of the positives here and we compare \u2013 I am just going to say EBITDA margins, but you can choose whichever you want. We look back over time, you have gotten back in the right kind of neighborhood here for what we would expect Schlumberger to deliver. If we look at what you are doing in terms of better market expansion, the service intensity you have mentioned, pricing power and the digital. Should it be the kind of situation where we can start thinking about margins getting back over the next several years to levels you have seen when business is truly firing on all cylinders, or is that a little too optimistic here?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think we \u2013 first, we will look forward to see you at the event in two weeks and indeed comment on this and give you more color. But it\u2019s clear that we are seeing and we are very positive on the outlook, both on the market fundamentals that are in place to support our ambition for growth across the Core, Digital, and New Energy for the reasons mentioned before and discussed during this Q&A. And also, we believe that the investment we have done and the performance we are delivering for customers is giving us indeed the earnings power that will continue to translate into margin expansion going forward. So, this is set, and I think we will comment more and give you more color on our ambition forward.\nRoger Read: That\u2019s fair. I know that was kind of a leading question on that, but I thought I would try it. The other one is, and this might be getting a little ahead of what you want to talk about in a couple of weeks, but can you remind us where you want to take the balance sheet in terms of fee? Are you comfortable enough with where your overall debt structure is and where we would think about more of a continuous or somewhat reliable way to think about dividend increases or anything else you would do with free cash?\nStephane Biguet: So Roger, first, we are quite happy with the progress we have made in deleveraging the balance sheet. We have not set a new target \u2013 a new leverage target at this stage, but as I mentioned earlier, we do continue to see the balance sheet continue to increase. As it relates to the uses of capital, as you saw, we made the first step in increasing returns to shareholders by increasing our dividend by 40%, starting with the July payment. And in the future, as cash flows grow over the cycle, clearly, there will be opportunities to continue improving returns to shareholders. And clearly, as well, we will provide you more details in \u2013 on November 3rd in New York.\nRoger Read: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you.\nOperator: And our last question will come from Luke Lemoine with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nLuke Lemoine: Hey. Good morning.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Good morning.\nLuke Lemoine: Olivier, maybe to attack Roger\u2019s question just a little different way. I wanted to see if you could touch on this multiyear international cycle how it\u2019s unfolding. And can you talk about how you see that versus 2005 to 2008 when pricing was very strong?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think it\u2019s always difficult to compare and make analog between cycles. But I think I will more focus on what is unique about this cycle. I think the conditions are set, and it includes a few critical, I would say, factors that I think - I don\u2019t think can be comparable and will lead to a unique cycle. One, I would say, is the global gas market is uniquely constrained and is structurally imbalanced. And I think this will lead the gas market both offshore, onshore, unconventional and conventional to continue to have a long growth cycle independently of the, I would say, some headwinds on the economic market. Second is offshore. Offshore has indeed started. Offshore, we have conditions from a breakeven price that are with all FID below $60, if not $40, that are set to support a very strong offshore environment for oil and in the gas environment, obviously, and this is very visible both in deepwater and in Middle East. Middle East will have one of the highest growths in offshore environment with more than 30 rigs. We are just contracted in the last six months by Saudi for oil development offshore. And last, I would say that the Middle East is set to have a combination of factors that include the maximum sustained capacity commitments or the enhanced capacity that has been committed by many countries in excess of forming and buying between 2025 and 2030, and we will not be surprised to see this commitment to be accelerated forward so that the Middle East is the swing producer of and expands the capacity. And the result of this because Middle East is also growing in its gas ambition and not only because of the LNG commitment from Qatar to exceed 120 MTPA by 2027, but also because the unconventional and conventional resources are being exploited for domestic and for regional markets. And all that combined, the oil capacity expansion, the gas will result into the largest ever investment cycle in Middle East. And this is starting, and this will be happening in the next 2 years or 3 years. So, 2 years or 3 years, Middle East will benefit from the largest investment cycle that we have seen. So, you have unique characteristics that can and cannot be compared with the past. So, I just want to focus on getting the best of this future market, positioning ourselves using our performance attributes, using our unique technology and preparing the team to participate at scale and being successful for our customers in this environment.\nLuke Lemoine: Alright. Thank you very much.\nEnd of Q&A:\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you. So, I believe that this will \u2013 we will close this call. So, ladies and gentlemen, I think to conclude, let me summarize with key takeaways that I would like you to remember. Firstly, Q3 results represent another quarter of outstanding execution and financial outperformance in our returns-focused strategy. This was achieved through the combined effects of significant international activity inflection, technology adoption, operating leverage and pricing premiums. These results give us confidence in our ability to deliver upon our promise and exceed our revised guidance for full year 2022. Secondly, we are witnessing a decoupling of upstream investment from uncertainties in the near-term economic outlook. Constructive market fundamentals reinforced by the energy crisis are decisively aligning in support of a multiyear upcycle. Furthermore, the activity mix and investment trends continue to evolve very favorably in alignment with our strengths, both geographically and across the breadth of our portfolio. Finally, the secular trends of digital transformation and decarbonization continue to gain momentum for a higher value and lower carbon future for our industry. Whilst at the same time, the global urgency on climate actions is resulting into an acceleration of clean energy investments. This is creating a unique combination of opportunities we are set to pursue at scale through our three engines of growth: Core, Digital and New Energy. Ladies and gentlemen, I could not be more satisfied with our performance to-date and with our outlook for the full year, to close a sequence of 3 years with remarkable progress against a very challenging backdrop. We are ready to further this success and continue our journey towards a bright future for the company. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Stephane Biguet",
            "content": "Thank you, Olivier and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Third quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.63. This represents an increase of $0.13 sequentially and $0.27 when compared to the third quarter of last year. This was the highest quarterly earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, since the fourth quarter of 2015. Overall, our third quarter revenue of $7.5 billion increased 10% sequentially. We witnessed a clear acceleration of growth during the quarter as evidenced by the 28% year-on-year revenue increase. Consistent with our expectations, activity shifted towards the international markets, particularly offshore. As a result, we experienced international sequential revenue growth of 13%, which significantly outpaced North America. Although we experienced volatility in certain foreign currency exchange rates across the world, the overall net effect on our revenue was negligible both sequentially and year-on-year. Turning to our profitability, pre-tax segment operating margins expanded 161 basis points sequentially to 18.7% and adjusted EBITDA margins increased 91 basis points to 23.5%. Margins also increased significantly as compared to the third quarter of last year, with pre-tax segment operating margins increasing 320 basis points year-on-year, while adjusted EBITDA margins increased 133 basis points. This significant margin expansion illustrates the benefits of the operating leverage and pricing momentum we have as well as our ability to manage inflationary headwinds. Let me now go through the third quarter results for each division. Third quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $900 million decreased $55 million sequentially, while margins were down 586 basis points to 33.9%. The effect of increased digital sales was offset by the absence of $95 million of exploration data transfer fees that we recorded last quarter. Reservoir Performance revenue of $1.5 billion increased 9% sequentially, while margins improved 209 basis points. These increases were driven by higher intervention and stimulation activity both on land and offshore. Well Construction revenue of $3.1 billion increased 15% sequentially, driven by strong activity growth both internationally and in North America as well as improved pricing. Margins expanded 403 basis points to 21.5% due to higher offshore activity, a favorable technology mix and solid pricing improvements. Finally, Production Systems revenue of $2.2 billion increased 14% sequentially, primarily driven by higher product deliveries and backlog conversion as supply chain logistics constraints continued to ease. The revenue increase was led by international markets, which grew 17% sequentially. As a result, margins returned to double-digits, increasing sequentially by 142 basis points to 10.4%, their highest level since the third quarter of 2019. Now turning to our liquidity. During the quarter, we generated $1.6 billion of cash flow from operations and free cash flow of $1.1 billion. This performance represents a significant improvement compared to the first half of the year as working capital started to unwind during the quarter despite the sequential revenue growth. Consistent with historical seasonal patterns, we expect this trend to accelerate in the fourth quarter, resulting into free cash flow improving sequentially. During the quarter, we made capital investments of just over $500 million. This amount includes CapEx and investments in APS projects and exploration data. For the full year of 2022, we are expecting capital investments to be approximately $2.2 billion as we continue to support very strong revenue growth, particularly in our Well Construction and Reservoir Performance divisions. Net debt improved by $1.3 billion during the quarter to end at $9.7 billion. This level of net debt represents a $2.7 billion improvement compared to the same period last year. Our net debt-to-EBITDA leverage is now down to 1.6x and we expect it to drop even further during the fourth quarter on a combination of higher earnings and improved free cash flow. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier. Good morning, James. Yes. Neil, as you saw, indeed the working capital improved quite a bit in the third quarter, this is how we predicted and it resulted into strong free cash flow. Going into Q4, you will see this accelerate as we typically see at the end of the year. So, working capital will continue to unwind and free cash flow will continue to increase. We have typically, at the end of the year, higher customer collections. We have the effect of higher product deliveries, reducing inventory. So, this is what we expect. So Roger, first, we are quite happy with the progress we have made in deleveraging the balance sheet. We have not set a new target \u2013 a new leverage target at this stage, but as I mentioned earlier, we do continue to see the balance sheet continue to increase. As it relates to the uses of capital, as you saw, we made the first step in increasing returns to shareholders by increasing our dividend by 40%, starting with the July payment. And in the future, as cash flows grow over the cycle, clearly, there will be opportunities to continue improving returns to shareholders. And clearly, as well, we will provide you more details in \u2013 on November 3rd in New York."

            "name": "Olivier Le Peuch",
            "content": "Thank you, ND. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us on the call. In my prepared remarks today, I will cover three topics, starting with our third quarter results and our latest view of the macro environment. Thereafter, I will conclude with our outlook for the remainder of this year. The second half is developing to be one of the most exciting times for the company in the recent past. We started with solid results led by the international market and we continued to execute at a very high level, delivering another quarter of double-digit revenue growth with earnings per share and EBITDA at the high levels since 2015. In addition to the details captured in our earnings release this morning, I would like to take a moment to reflect on some of the key highlights for the quarter. To start, year-on-year revenue growth accelerated to 28%, the highest growth rate since 2011, more than a decade ago. Internationally, all areas grew and the pace of growth increased to 13% sequentially and 26% year-over-year. Activity and revenue trends confirm the onset of another phase in the global growth cycle, one that will be increasingly driven by the international and the offshore markets. Through our breadth and technology integration, we are optimally positioned to benefit strongly from the acceleration of activity that is expected in the quarters and years ahead. In our Core, all Divisions continue to execute very well and the impact of operating leverage and improving net pricing was reflected in our results. All Divisions in our Core posted margin expansion led by Well Construction, our biggest division, which posted over 400 bps sequential improvement. We also held our Digital Forum in Lucerne, Switzerland, bringing together captains of industry in energy and information technology, over 1,000 thought leaders, partners and customers. This year's forum was our biggest yet and marks an inflection point for digital. Our long-term competitiveness as an industry depends on our ability to effectively harness technology, data and deeper collaboration. During the 3 days of active engagement, it became increasingly clear to all participants that through digital, we enter the future better equipped to deliver higher value in terms of performance and decarbonization. In parallel, we also continued to strengthen our Core portfolio, increasing our opportunity set in the lucrative offshore markets. We announced an agreement to form a joint venture with Aker Solutions and Subsea 7. This agreement will bring together a complementary portfolio of technologies and unmatched integration capabilites to help customers increase production, improve efficiency, and meet their decarbonization goals. In the Core and in Digital, our technologies are increasingly being adopted and are positively impacting our customer performance. We secured several significant multiyear contract wins during the quarter and continue to build a solid pipeline of activity for the future. And finally, in New Energy, we continue to make significant advances building partnerships, investing and developing new capabilities. We announced an agreement with RTI International to accelerate the industrialization and scale-up of innovative non-aqueous solvent CO2 capture technology. We also made an investment in ZEG Power to accelerate the development of technology for clean hydrogen production from natural gas. Both of these are advancing our roadmap for hydrogen and CCUS. Recent policy enactments in the U.S. and Europe are supportive of our selected New Energy domains, technology-led approach and market growth opportunities. We expect to announce additional progress in the coming weeks and months as we continue to position the company for long-term participation across the entire energy value chain. To sum up, we entered the second half of the year with expectations for strong growth momentum and raised our revenue guidance for the full year. This was predicated on a robust international outlook, the strengthening of offshore activity and the broadening impact of service pricing improvements. I am very pleased with the evolution of these dynamics and our execution thus far, both of which continue to result in differentiated operational performance and solid financial results. I would like to thank the entire Schlumberger team for delivering another exceptional quarter. Turning now to the macro, we have strengthened our view in a multi-year up-cycle as we are on the cusp of yet another year of growth. Despite concerns over the slowdown of global growth rates and the potential for recession, the fundamentals for energy as a critical resource remain very constructive. First, in the near-term, a seasonal uptick in demand as winter approaches is pitted against a very intricate supply landscape for both oil and gas through the end of the year. This situation is exacerbated by the ongoing energy crisis in Europe. Looking further out into the horizon, the demand supply picture remains delicate with this imbalance amplified by geopolitics, increased instances of supply disruptions and limited spare global capacity. Second, the growing necessity of energy security and supply-source diversification will also bring \u2013 also drive urgent increases in energy investment. A significant step-up in investment is required to create supply redundancies, rebalance markets and rebuild global spare capacity to levels that provide for sustainable economic growth. And third, recent OPEC+ decisions and the extension of its framework for cooperation through 2023 are additional factors that will enable operation \u2013 operators to invest with a higher degree of confidence in their commodity price assumptions. Taken together, these dynamics will result in a supply-led upcycle, characterized by resilient upstream investment that is decoupled from near-term demand volatility. We expect investment growth will be durable, reinforced by the long-term demand trajectory, multi-year capacity expansion plans, lower operating breakeven prices and supportive commodity prices. Growth will be simultaneous in North America and in the international markets. This started first in the North America market and we are already witnessing the next phase of growth with an acceleration in pace, in the offshore and international markets that was very visible in the third quarter. In the U.S. land markets, we are participating more profitably in the more accretive and lower capital-intensive market segments, where our technology, performance premiums and our technology access business model are driving solid revenue and margins growth. In the international and offshore markets, we have increased market access and enhanced our participation across the value chain through a combination of portfolio actions, fit-for-basin technology and higher \u201cwallet share\u201d on account of our performance and integration capabilities. The next phase of global market inflection is expected to be driven by increasing activity in the Middle East. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect another quarter of sequential revenue growth and EBITDA margin expansion to close the year. Sequential growth will reflect historical seasonal trends. The international markets will be driven by a sequential uptick in the Middle East activity as capacity expansion projects begin to mobilize. Global Offshore activity will continue to strengthen, offset by the approaching seasonality in the Northern Hemisphere, while North American land activity is expected to moderate its growth trend. This combination will result in fourth quarter year-on-year revenue growth in the mid-20s and 200 bps EBITDA margin expansion when compared to the fourth quarter of 2021. Against this backdrop, we will visibly surpass our previously raised revenue guidance for the full year. This updated outlook will wrap up what is set to be an outstanding year for the company. Looking further ahead, we have increased our conviction on our strategy and the growth opportunities across our three engines: the Core, Digital and New Energy. Constructive oil and gas market fundamentals, energy security and the need to accelerate the energy transition will support increased investments in both clean energy technology development and lower carbon oil and gas production. We have positioned the company to outperform in the long-term with multiple technology led opportunities across the entire energy value chain. These opportunities cover oil and gas, industrial decarbonization and new energy systems, all supported by digital transformation. We are ready to apply our technology, global scale and industrialization capabilities to lead in this energy landscape and deliver outstanding value for customers and shareholders. And finally, we will hold our Investors Conference in New York in a couple of weeks, where I look forward to seeing most of you. During this event, we will articulate our ambition for the future, including our near-term goals for 2023. As part of this year's Investors Conference, you will also have an immersive opportunity to see and touch some of our exciting new technologies and meet with members of our expanded management team. I am truly excited about this upcoming event. I will now turn the call over to Stephane. Thank you, Stephane. And ladies and gentlemen, I think we are ready for the Q&A session. Good morning. No, I think I would like to comment qualitatively on the strength and the power of the Core. First and foremost, I think it's built on the two critical foundations. One is performance. Performance matters in this industry and performance gives us differentiation. I think here from our technology reliability, from the competency of our people and the way we remote digitally control and monitor operations, we are leading and we are recognized as such in the industry. The second is our customer intimacy. Our customer intimacy coming from the geographical basins and engagement we have that give us opportunity to deliver this fit-for-basin technology that are creating a unique differentiator and creating loyalty with our customers. So I believe these are the foundations. Now the delivery comes from our integration, our technology and our people competency and field operation. When you combine this and we have done that for decades, but I think \u2013 and when the market comes with higher revenue intensity in offshore markets and in unique projects where integration matters and technology mix and impact and create value for the customer, we see more adoption of our technology. We see more market share consolidation, and we see and recognize more pricing premium. So we see this trend to continue as the international market, the offshore market, the Middle East is the next leg of growth internationally. And we believe that the adjustment we did in our portfolio, the high grading we did in North America to tune the portfolio to be fit and focused on the capital light and technology differentiation, and this, combined with international footprint and strength we have retained, I think, give us a unique set of benefits as the market continues to unfold going forward. I think it was, obviously, as we said, not only the biggest yet, but the most successful yet, event on the back of multiple factors. The first, the quality and level of the audience that did participate to this on both our strategic partners and our customers that made the effort to attend and engage to the event and all agreed that this event was a defining moment for them and they believe for the industry as it created an inflection point in recognizing the value of digital in performance impact, in decarbonization and in the efficiency going forward for the industry, building as a factor of resiliency and performance for the long-term for the industry. So I think that's the highest takeaway. Now the other key ability we have is \u2013 and we had is that we had a product acknowledgment from the customers that were attending and from customers that were watching while it was happening that \u2013 our platform and our ecosystem with the partners we have created around our platform is becoming very mature and is delivering value and has already been improving its worth for many, many customers. So the buzz around the success of the platform and the value from subsurface to surface to remote operation or digital operation has been recognized, and this will call for more success. So I believe we're at an inflection point in the adoption and we are seeing it through the different contracts, and you have seen some of them that are coming through in the press release, and you will see more coming \u2013 in the coming months and quarters that reflect the adoption at scale of our solution and it's not only subsurface. It's not only this domain, it's expanding. And I think the announcement we made with Microsoft to offer an Enterprise Data Solution and the first commercial solution on OSDU is making an impact. Similarly, the announcement we made with Aker on the Cognite data foundation to expand and provide the only subsurface to operation integrated ecosystem for workflows and interoperability is unique. So the adoption is about to scale. And finally, you have seen that we also announced that the power of our platform has attracted the commitments and the collaboration with Saudi Aramco to go beyond upstream and to create a platform for carbon management. So I believe the table is set for success, if I may, going forward, and you will start to see this, this quarter and in the years to come. Welcome. Good morning, David. You're correct. And I think the \u2013 as part of the mix as well, the international has made a comeback ahead of other basins. And you will see the next leg of growth coming from Middle East activity in the coming quarters, but I think that's one factor. But I think technology to deliver performance, our customers are more focused on critical assets where they want execution, and they want performance enhancements and higher return on their capital, lower cost, higher return, but this translates into higher adoption of field technology, adoption of digital technology and the power of integration. So, when we have the power of integration technology adoption and are increasingly being recognized for performance and some of it through contracts that are performance-based, I think we are gaining recognition and we are, in effect, creating a net increase in the intensity of service, but also a net pricing impact. And I think that pricing has many, many dimensions, it comes from a mix of adoption of technology. It comes from the performance that \u2013 for which we are getting commercial contracts recognized and share the value of the performance it creates. And it comes from pricing \u2013 catalog pricing, as I would say, the combination of which is creating a net effect that we have been benefiting from. And indeed, particularly in Well Construction, where I think the breadth of capacity we have that is unique across the industry. The track record of benchmark of performance, the competence of our people, the digital operation transformation we did, all have impacted our cost of service delivery for one, have impacted the performance we have created for our customers and as such has created the service intensity that is creating higher earnings. That's a fair hypothesis going forward. I think the Middle East has been lagging the growth and the rebound primarily due to the some of the constraint on the short cycle over the last 18 months due to OPEC+, but I think the four or five countries that have set some new expansion plans have \u2013 initiated this expansion plan in the second half and are set to accelerate their expansion plan going forward. I think it includes Saudi, it includes UAE, Kuwait, Iraq and what has been the first to expand, which is Qatar, on the LNG commitment towards 2027 will continue to expand as well. So I think the combination of this will create a new leg of growth next year internationally, and we will be set to benefit from it across all the divisions. Thank you. Good morning. Well, I think we are seeing this already today. And I think we have pricing impact started, as I said, 2 years ago, 1.5 years ago in North America and has been broadening, has been very visible internationally in the last quarter. So the \u2013 all the fundamental elements for - are in place, indeed. First and foremost, I think the capital discipline that we have in our organization is remaining firmly in place. Capital stewardship is clear, to us, and we deploy an asset in the contract and in the market to be accretive to our returns. The service intensity also considering the deployment of more offshore rigs is also increasing the pull on the existing net pool of resource technology that is getting further stretched on the demand of supply in our capacity. And finally, as I said earlier, the performance factor on the base foundation of our operations, be it our Core performance, be it technology that are fit for basin and are creating a performance premium for our customers or digital - operation of digital portfolio that we are rolling out are all creating a performance impact that the customers are looking for. Customers are willing to develop and are keen to develop their assets, provided that we develop them \u2013 if we help them develop them efficiently at lower capital intensity and with beating the curve and creating new performance benchmark. And I think this has a price and I think we differentiate in this environment. So we expect the future, indeed, internationally to support this pricing and these market conditions. No, as we commented earlier, and we commented in making of our subsea JV, and we addressed some of this as in previous communication, we are very constructive into the deepwater market going forward. The recent pipeline of FID that has been blessed in recent months, the pipeline that is set in 2023 according to Wood Mack is at $170 billion of FID that will be the highest in the last 10 years since 2011. And the mobilization of projects across the different deepwater basins continues. There are some critical and very positive trends in Brazil, in Norway, Guyana continue to be and that Latin America basin with still some appraisal both from the Columbia gas offshore or the Suriname will be complemented by further activity in Africa and also in Asia. So we are positive on the outlook. The number of trees is growing and has grown visibly to now exceed 300 trees. And these are \u2013 this is setting the market condition for supporting higher price and again, linked to performance in life cycle reduction, performance emerging in reservoir recovery using boosting and processing technology that are becoming increasingly critical. And hence, we believe the conditions are set to be positive for the deepwater partly for subsea market. I think it's a combination where we are obviously extremely pleased with the performance of Well Construction during the last quarter, but not only during the last quarter. I think it has been a division that has been on a journey for the last few years, where we realized that we had the opportunity to put together the best and the biggest portfolio and the most comprehensive breadth of capabilities across the technology portfolio for Well Construction. We adjusted and changed the structure and the organization to combine all of this in one division, less than 3 years ago and about 2 years ago, and we are reaping the benefit from this, both from a technology adoption, from performance in integration, and from customer intimacy, giving us opportunity to expand our market access and expand our success and then critically creating the pricing impact and the earnings impact we want. So part of this, we have fit-for-basin technology that have created a unique performance impact and recognized as such. We have digital operations that we are increasingly using to impact the performance and the accuracy of our well placements and the efficiency of our operations as such, reducing our cost of service delivery. And we continue to introduce, as we said, technology that are making an impact and a difference on the market. So we are positive for the outlook. It's the biggest division. It has and will continue to lead in the Core going forward. And we remain very, very optimistic about the outcome, and we believe that the customers recognize the performance and look forward using and adopting Well Construction. I think it's \u2013 it was mostly offshore. It was driven by significant contracts that we have been executing in offshore environment, in Europe, in the Black Sea, in Norway, in Africa, a rebound of operations. I think the mix has been highly favorable, and this is the power of our Core and including Well Construction that has been played out very well. We have many contracts that we have announced, and we have been communicating earlier like the Ormen Lange project. I think we had some progress there. We have our Black Sea deepwater project, and we have more that have been combining to create much impact on Production Systems and Well Construction during the quarter. You're welcome. I think first, I think I have been sharing in my prepared remarks, some guidance that's comparing the fourth quarter to the fourth quarter of last year with mid-20s revenue growth and 200 bps EBITDA expansion. And I think from the geography of business lines, I would only comment that we see an uptick in Middle East to materialize, and we expect digital to further accelerate and to reflect the year-end sales that we typically have. So, it's a positive outlook, continued growth, both internationally and in North America and margin expansion to set to continue its very successful journey. Good morning. I think it's a very good observation. I think we expect indeed that the journey of digital transformation for our customers will take time. And I think it's a long tail of transformation. We expect that will impact our results for a decade to come, I would say. However, we are indeed observing an inflection point that is reflecting onto the maturity of our platform and to the acceptability of this platform as the most effective platform that the customers have seen in terms of impacting their life cycle reduction, impacting the productivity of their asset team and providing them access to cloud computing resources and to digital operation capability that is not available to them today. So, we are seeing the adoption of our customers. We mentioned in the past that we have a baseline of 1,500 customers that are currently using our digital solution and our previous software suite of products. And we believe that we are today between 200 and 300 of those customers about 20% of these that have already adopted and have started to move and transition onto the platform, and we expect this to accelerate both in number of customers, but also into the expansion these customers are using \u2013 the way they are using our platform and expanding the workflows, expanding the scope, indeed, adding the data enterprise solution as a necessity to go and reset and transform their data infrastructure and then adopting workflows from subsurface workflows to operational workflows. So, there are multiple dimensions, complete intensity dimension, workflow dimension and customer \u2013 number of customer dimension that we are set to benefit for the years ahead. I think it's both. We believe that there is a compelling event and accompanying need and utmost priority for the oil and gas to decarbonize itself. It comes into the engagement we have and the success we are having with energy transition technology portfolio to reduce the carbon footprint or the Scope 1 and 2 of our customers. It comes in bright lights with the portfolio we have created, the SEES portfolio, end-to-end emission management for methane, in particular and getting more traction and more success with this portfolio. So, I believe that this is happening at scale, and our customers are turning into a clear, I would say, initiative \u2013 set of initiatives to reduce the oil and - the carbon footprint of their operations and to target a lower carbon oil and lower carbon gas production. So, this is the first trend, and this is happening at scale and this will include CCS opportunities that we are developing as well in parallel. On the side of this, there is a lot happening into the clean energy \u2013 and I believe that you have seen some announcement in the IRA. You have seen some announcement in the REPowerEU that are aligned with the domains we have selected, the \u2013 be it geoenergy for efficiency, be it critical mineral to lithium, or be it hydrogen with getting credits at large, and obviously, CCS with the 45Q improving to help us address not only the CCS opportunity to - that are close to our oil and gas customers, but also the ones that are close to hard-to-abate sectors. So, I believe that I will not try to contrast both, I will more recognize that both represent huge opportunity of growth, existing customers and with new customers and that we are set to grow and build opportunity on both. Thank you. Good morning. I think we \u2013 first, we will look forward to see you at the event in two weeks and indeed comment on this and give you more color. But it's clear that we are seeing and we are very positive on the outlook, both on the market fundamentals that are in place to support our ambition for growth across the Core, Digital, and New Energy for the reasons mentioned before and discussed during this Q&A. And also, we believe that the investment we have done and the performance we are delivering for customers is giving us indeed the earnings power that will continue to translate into margin expansion going forward. So, this is set, and I think we will comment more and give you more color on our ambition forward. Thank you. Good morning. I think it's always difficult to compare and make analog between cycles. But I think I will more focus on what is unique about this cycle. I think the conditions are set, and it includes a few critical, I would say, factors that I think - I don't think can be comparable and will lead to a unique cycle. One, I would say, is the global gas market is uniquely constrained and is structurally imbalanced. And I think this will lead the gas market both offshore, onshore, unconventional and conventional to continue to have a long growth cycle independently of the, I would say, some headwinds on the economic market. Second is offshore. Offshore has indeed started. Offshore, we have conditions from a breakeven price that are with all FID below $60, if not $40, that are set to support a very strong offshore environment for oil and in the gas environment, obviously, and this is very visible both in deepwater and in Middle East. Middle East will have one of the highest growths in offshore environment with more than 30 rigs. We are just contracted in the last six months by Saudi for oil development offshore. And last, I would say that the Middle East is set to have a combination of factors that include the maximum sustained capacity commitments or the enhanced capacity that has been committed by many countries in excess of forming and buying between 2025 and 2030, and we will not be surprised to see this commitment to be accelerated forward so that the Middle East is the swing producer of and expands the capacity. And the result of this because Middle East is also growing in its gas ambition and not only because of the LNG commitment from Qatar to exceed 120 MTPA by 2027, but also because the unconventional and conventional resources are being exploited for domestic and for regional markets. And all that combined, the oil capacity expansion, the gas will result into the largest ever investment cycle in Middle East. And this is starting, and this will be happening in the next 2 years or 3 years. So, 2 years or 3 years, Middle East will benefit from the largest investment cycle that we have seen. So, you have unique characteristics that can and cannot be compared with the past. So, I just want to focus on getting the best of this future market, positioning ourselves using our performance attributes, using our unique technology and preparing the team to participate at scale and being successful for our customers in this environment."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Nd Maduemezia. Please go ahead.\nNd Maduemezia: Thank you, Leah. Good morning, everyone and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited second quarter 2022 earnings conference call. Today\u2019s call is being hosted from Paris, following the Schlumberger Limited board meeting held earlier this week. Joining us on the call are Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Executive Officer; and Stephane Biguet, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind all participants that some of the statements we will be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and our other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our second quarter press release, which is on our website. With that, I will turn the call over to Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Nd. Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us on the call. In my prepared remarks today, I will cover three topics, starting with our second quarter results and our latest view of the macro environment. Thereafter, I will conclude with our outlook for the second half of the year and its compelling attributes, which are very supportive of our raised guidance for the full year. The second quarter was a defining moment in the overall trajectory of the year, with significant growth in revenue, margin expansion and earnings per share. Our execution was solid, and directionally, all trends were positively in our favor. Strong international activity growth and steady drilling momentum in North America, sustained offshore recovery and the broadening impact of improved pricing. We leverage the power of our core, our global footprint and differentiated technology to seize widening industry activity, demonstrating our ability to capture growth in every land and offshore basin from North America to most remote international basin. This was reflected in the broad dimension of growth in our second quarter results as customers stepped up activity with a focus on increased performance and production. Overall, we effectively harness these positive dynamics and delivery very strong second short quarter revenue and earnings growth. In addition to the details provided in our earnings press release this morning, let me reiterate some performance highlights from the quarter. We recorded 14% revenue increase, the largest sequential revenue increase in more than a decade, as revenue growth exceeded rig count increase, both internationally and in North America. Year-on-year revenue growth accelerated to 20%, further sustaining robust growth momentum with a visible inflection in international markets at 50% growth over same period last year. Growth was very broad across all dimensions: area, divisions, land and offshore, with spending visibly higher across all customer types. Internationally, sequential growth was recorded in all of our Middle East and Asia units and all of Latin America and ECA growth was pervasive across Europe, Scandinavia and West Africa. In North America, we continue to post very solid growth offshore and onshore and on increased drilling and completions activity. The rise of offshore activity, particularly deepwater, was a key driver for our second quarter sequential growth in most regions and in support of all divisions. Globally, all four divisions posted double-digit revenue growth and expanded margins sequentially, resulting in the highest quarterly operating margins level since 2015. In addition, another feature of the quarter was broadening pricing improvement, impacting all divisions, geographies and operating environment. Finally, the quarter also marked a number of new contract wins and an increase in backlog for production systems and our re-equipment business, another leading indicator of the strength of activity pipeline ahead of us. Notably, price improvement is also being reflected in production system backlog, which is significant for its later cycle implication for sustained margins expansion on an overall portfolio basis. To sum up, the second quarter emphasizes our clearly differentiated operational performance, strategic execution and financial results, both in North America and internationally. We have very strong momentum and have secured a solid pipeline of activity ahead of us. I am very proud of the entire Schlumberger team for delivering these exceptional results and demonstrating our unique value proposition for both our customers and our shareholders. Turning now to the macro, first, energy security and urgency to establish more diverse and reliable source of oil and gas supply has become increasingly apparent through the year, exacerbated by the effect of ongoing conflict in Ukraine and a notable increase in periodic supply disruptions in certain regions. Second, supply and excess spare capacity remains very tight as recent OPEC and IEA demand outlooks for \u201822 and \u201823 remain constructive, continuing to suggest a call on supply from North America and a more significant call on supply from the international basins. Third, despite near-term concern of a global economic slowdown, the combination of energy security, favorable breakeven price and urgency to grow long-term oil and gas production capacity will continue to support strong upstream E&P spending growth. Consequently, we are witnessing a decoupling of upstream spending from potential near-term demand volatility, resulting in resilient global oil and gas activity growth in 2022 and beyond. Additionally, the factors supporting pricing tailwinds, more specifically the tightening service supply capacity, both in NAM, and increasingly, in international markets, will continue to operate on the defining characteristics of this up-cycle and will support both revenue growth and margin expansion, more than offsetting inflation. Looking more specifically at the second half of the year, we see very robust activity dynamics characterized by distinct acceleration of investments in the international basins and the continued strengthening of offshore activity as all operators, including IOCs, step-up spending. The energy security situation continues to drive structural activity increase, resulting from the increased focus on short-term production and the mid to long-term capacity expansion across oil and gas plays. In addition, we also expect further exploration and appraisal activity and the pricing dynamics experience so far to add further support to both the growth trajectory and the margins performance during the second half. This positive undercurrent will lead to an attractive mix and an increase in short and long-cycle international projects, complementing already robust short cycle activity in North America. Directionally, during the second half of the year, we expect a strong continuation of growth in the core led by production systems for the rest of the year with Digital & Integration benefiting from typically seasonally strong year end sales. Also and as a result of the rotation of investment towards international basins, we anticipate our highest growth rate during the second half to occur internationally, setting up a very nice backdrop for 2023 by outlook. Based on this, we expect our H2 revenue this year to grow at least high-teens compared to the same period last year. Full year revenue growth will therefore be in the high-teens, consisting revenue of at least $27 billion for 2022. Furthermore, our adjusted EBITDA, in absolute dollar terms, will increase by at least 25% for the full year of 2022 when compared to 2021. Indeed, 2022 is stepping up to be an outstanding year for Schlumberger. The power of our core, our digital and decarbonization leadership and the expensive attribute of this upcycle enabled us to leverage focused North America business with an unparalleled international breadth. The combination of which favorably exposed Schlumberger to durable top line growth, earnings and further margin expansion potential that is unmatched in the sector. Beyond this, the momentum we are building through the second half of the year and the exit rates that we will have achieved bode very well for our 2023 outlook and financial ambition, both of which we will share in more details at our investor conference in November. I look forward to seeing many of you in person at this event. I will now turn the call over to Stephane.\nStephane Biguet: Thank you, Olivier and good morning ladies and gentlemen. Second quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.50. This represents an increase of $0.16 sequentially and $0.20 when compared to the second quarter of last year. This also represented the highest quarterly earnings per share since the fourth quarter of 2015. In addition, during the first quarter, we recorded a $0.14 gain relating to the further sale of a portion of our shares in Liberty Energy and a $0.03 gain relating to the sale of certain real estate, which brought our GAAP EPS to $0.67. Overall, our second quarter revenue of $6.8 billion increased 14% sequentially. This represented the strongest sequential quarterly growth since 2010. All four divisions experienced double-digit increases. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had virtually no impact on the sequential revenue increase. Pre-tax operating margins expanded 212 basis points sequentially to 17.1% and EBITDA margins increased 157 basis points to 22.6%. These increases largely reflect the seasonal rebound in activity, a favorable technology mix, particularly on higher offshore activities and strong exploration data licensing sales in our digital and integration division. Margins also increased significantly as compared to the second quarter of last year. Pre-tax segment operating margins increased 279 basis points year-on-year, while adjusted EBITDA margins increased 133 basis points year-on-year. This margin performance is even more notable considering the inflationary headwinds we continue to face. This demonstrates our ability to manage inflation through our supply chain organization as well as through pricing adjustments from our customers. Let me now go through the second quarter results for each division. Second quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $955 million increased 11% sequentially, with margins increasing 570 basis points to 39.7%. These increases were primarily due to higher exploration data licensing sales, including $95 million of transfer fees. Reservoir performance revenue of $1.3 billion increased 10% sequentially, beyond the impact of the seasonal rebound in activity, driven by growth both on land and offshore. Margins improved 143 basis points to 14.6%, primarily as a result of the seasonal recovery and higher offshore and exploration activity. Well Construction revenue of $2.7 million increased 12%, driven by strong growth and improved pricing both internationally and in North America. Margins increased 134 basis points to 17.5% due to the higher activity, combined with a favorable technology mix and improved pricing. Finally, Production Systems revenue of $1.9 billion increased 18% sequentially and margins increased 190 basis points to 9%. Global supply chain and logistics constraints started to abate, resulting in higher product deliveries and backlog conversion. International growth outpaced North America growth and was particularly strong in the Europe/CIS/Africa area. Now turning to our liquidity, during the quarter, we generated \u20ac408 million of cash flow from operations and negative free cash flow of $119 million. Working capital consumed $936 million of cash during the quarter, largely driven by higher receivables due to the significant revenue growth. However, our DSO improved sequentially. Inventory also increased as we continue to manage lead times in anticipation of continuous growth in the second half of the year, particularly in our Production Systems division. Consistent with our historical trends, we expect our working capital and cash flow generation to significantly improve over the second half of the year. During the quarter, we made capital investments of $527 million. This amount includes CapEx and investments in APS projects and seismic exploration data. Although it is reflected outside the free cash flow, our overall cash position was enhanced by the further sale of a portion of our shares in Liberty, which generated $430 million of net proceeds. We currently hold a 12% interest in Liberty. During the quarter, we also sold certain real estate, which resulted in proceeds of $120 million. As a result, our net debt improved by $406 million during the quarter to $11 billion. This level of net debt represented a $2 billion improvement compared to the same period last year. Furthermore, we have now achieved our previously stated leverage target of 2x net debt-to-EBITDA. We expect our leverage to continue decreasing throughout the rest of the year on a combination of higher earnings and improved free cash flow, allowing us to further strengthen our balance sheet. This will provide us with the financial flexibility required to continue funding growth and increased returns to shareholders throughout the cycle. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Stephane. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe we are opening the floor to the questions.\nOperator: Very good. [Operator Instructions] Our first question goes to the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nJames West: Hey, good morning, Olivier and Stephane.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Good morning, James.\nJames West: So Olivier, curious how you are thinking about the evolution of the \u2013 particularly international cycle as we go through the next several quarters and really into next year? I mean we are clearly \u2013 OFS or energy is decoupling from the global economy, you are going to see some changes in probably activity levels, the mix, the pricing. It seems to me the kind of the best is still to come, I think, for the cycle. So, just kind of curious of your broad outlook for international?\nOlivier Le Peuch: No, first, I want to reinforce that the macro environment we are facing is quite unique. It\u2019s a confluence and unprecedented low spare capacity, 8 years of underinvestment in international basins and a call for energy security that is creating a double sourcing of both oil and gas parts of the international basins. So, when you put that together, it trades not only a short cycle impulse on production enhancements to respond to that energy security, but also reinforce the need for expanding oil capacity, accelerating gas development and the entire set of international basis both offshore and onshore benefit from it, right, as we see. So, we have seen an inflection in the sentiment of our customers, both our national company, international oil company and international independent, to respond to that call and turning and accelerating the investments and rotating their investment internationally visibly. So, this is certainly a multi-leg, I will call it, multi-phase, both oil and gas positive environment forward. So, we have seen that Latin America has been the first to benefit from that inflection and we see that continuing going forward as from Guyana to Brazil to Colombia as a short cycle to Argentina as a shale exposed environment. We foresee this to be continuing, including exploration offshore Colombia, our Atlantic margin in Brazil this is set to continue going forward. We are seeing this to rotate in ECA, as you may have seen, more than offsetting the constraints we have in Russia-Ukraine region and creating a superb undercurrent, as I like to call it and all offshore basins in this region. And we have seen it in very strong in Europe, West Africa and Scandinavia with the unique tax incentive set that will start to be kicking in next year will only accelerate that trend, and East Mediterranean or Black Sea will also see continuous growth going forward. So \u2013 and you turn to Middle East and Asia. I think you have a combination of oil capacity commitment increase by both UAE, Saudi, and to a certain extent, Kuwait, that will play out. And well, in the case of KSA, create an uptick in offshore activity partly from next year. You see that the gas that is being developed at large scale in Middle East, both for domestic and for fuel substitution, that will continue to play to our strength in Qatar and commercial in both UAE and Saudi, Oman. And then you have the Asia market. That is also not shy of investments, and you see that long-term into the South China Sea as well. So I think it\u2019s multi-branch, multi-color, I would say, and it has started strong in line, and we will turn to your further ECA, further Middle East with inflection have been materialized as the quarter executed going forward.\nJames West: Okay. Okay, got it. That\u2019s very helpful, Oliver. Maybe a quick follow-up from me, you have your digital event coming up here in September. I\u2019ve been following kind of the list of speakers, very impressive group that you\u2019re assembling. And I\u2019m curious where you see the industry now, where you see Schlumberger in the industry and the digitalization or the digital journey of the industry? It seems to be that we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ve been selecting what we seem to be inflecting even further in digital, and certainly, the results are proving that out in your income statement as well. So curious about digital.\nOlivier Le Peuch: No, I think you are correct. And I think the number and the rich panels that we are assembling into this digital forum in September, is there for the reason. First and foremost is because the industry believes in digital, that digital can add a significant step-up in efficiency that will continue to impact positively cost cash generation and will contribute to decarbonization of operations. So that\u2019s the reason why we are seeing customer coming in the high number and record number to our digital form. And the second reason we have this success is our thought leadership and platform strategy that has been adopted and that has been the cornerstone of our success in digital, and we are using it to continue to transition all of our customer base towards this cloud platform. And this is a long tail, and this will certainly last all this decade and beyond, and we are looking forward to success, long success here. But also, we are using this platform and the digital capability to continue to enhance our operation, to continue to transform our digital operations, to impact our customers and our operations for efficiency and for performance. So, lifting up through efficiency, lifting up the performance and hence getting a premium or getting an increment of market position. So, it has a dual effect. But the success of digital form is certainly the credit to our team, but also the proof that digital is now mainstream into this industry.\nJames West: Got it. Thanks, Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Welcome.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Anderson with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nDavid Anderson: Hey, good morning, Olivier. So going across your numbers, you grew in every region in every segment. But the one I thought was really interesting was MENA. It grew 7% this quarter, but it didn\u2019t even \u2013 in the Middle East, it hasn\u2019t even started yet. So I was wondering if you could just kind of start there and just help us give us a sense of kind of where you stand today in terms of project mobilization and how that region is building out? And I\u2019m just kind of curious when do you fully expect to be up and running on the contracts you have in hand? And I guess related to that, it\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve seen a ramp-up in activity over there. But we\u2019ve often seen start-up delays and higher costs that lead up to the work. So aside from just pure execution, are there ways that you can navigate some of these risks? Are there lessons learned from past cycles? Or is it different because this is much more integrated drilling work that didn\u2019t exist in prior cycles?\nOlivier Le Peuch: No. I think I believe that our team has improved its execution track record. We have, as you may remember, 3 years ago, we took some action on to our underperforming contracts. And we learned and applied some best practice, best lessons and project management to technology deployment and to the discipline in our competency management deployment and use of digital to help us execute this contract in a better way. And from the way we manage the maintenance cycle of our equipment to the way we deploy and do remote operation to control and help and support people on the ground, I think we have progressed a lot in the last few years. And as such, the major contract we are starting always has \u2013 have a learning period. But I think we are accelerating this learning period by contrast to previous cycle. And I think we are set for success on all this project before soon. And \u2013 but we always have somewhere, somehow, in international basin, in a major project start-up. And \u2013 but we expect this to be, I would say, the background that we will have going forward, but our execution, practical lesson learned, use of digital, best practice and disciplined organization, including our competency that we deploy, has helped us to accelerate the lesson learned and to reach maturity in terms of performance, margins on those projects faster than the income second. So I\u2019m positive. And as I said, there is an inflection building up in Middle East activity that will materialize in two or three countries visibly into the second half, and will accelerate next year as we will see more offshore shallow activity partially into the VCC environment in Middle East led by the Saudi oil major development that they are accelerating for oil capacity increase towards their 2027 1 million barrel. This will translate into activity. So further activity increase will materialize, and we will benefit from it. The industry will certainly have a large ramp-up going forward. So it\u2019s the early cycle of growth in Middle East.\nDavid Anderson: The offshore market was actually my second question there. You\u2019re \u2013 the really \u2013 the offshore markets are really tailor-made for your technology profile. Exploration, drilling, subsea boosting, so \u2013 and recognizing on that, there is a ramp-up on the shallow water side and the jackups in the Middle East. Is it too soon to say an overall kind of offshore inflection is here? We noticed a lot of your \u2013 Yes. We saw a lot of your oil offshore, Gulf of Mexico, if not too soon? Okay.\nOlivier Le Peuch: No, it\u2019s not too soon. In the second quarter, international, offshore was accretive to our growth, International, visibly, and you can see it into the ECA growth. And I think if you read some of the reports published by and others, I think you see that \u2013 you see that the outlook for 2022, 2025 on offshore investments and FID activity will outpace visibly at 2016-2019 cycle. So we have early innings of this offshore cycle, but it\u2019s quite interesting. And it includes more exposure or more appraisal activity than we could have anticipated considering the \u2013 some of the macro, but we are seeing it from Namibia to Colombia to Asia. We are seeing interesting exploration happening to north of Brazil in the Atlantic Margin. We are seeing acceleration of appraisal and exploration that combined and increase the beneficiary mix, I would say, that we are seeing in offshore environment. So yes, we are very, very close, as we recently commented doing a conference in June. We were \u2013 we believe that the average revenue intensity that we collect from an offshore environment is \u2013 can be up to 5x or more what we collect in the land environment. And the scope that we have is quite unique from, as you said, from subsea to exploration, from data licensing to integrated rig and well construction. So it\u2019s quite unique, and we will benefit increasingly on that offshore outlook.\nDavid Anderson: Excellent. Thank you very much.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, David.\nOperator: Our next question is from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nChase Mulvehill: Hi, good morning. Good afternoon, over in Europe. I guess I want to come back to the topic on international, and maybe follow-up a little bit on James\u2019 question. Obviously, we\u2019ve now seen kind of three of the diversified service companies, international results. I mean, they have all surprised to the upside, so it feels like that activity may be a little bit higher than kind of what we all thought kind of heading into 2Q. But could you talk about the fundamental tightness that you\u2019re seeing across the international market, and whether you\u2019re seeing kind of broad-based pricing at this point or is it just kind of more pockets of pricing increases? So just a little bit on pricing across the international side?\nOlivier Le Peuch: No, it\u2019s definitively broadening. As activity continues to ramp up and includes an offshore mix that typically has more pull on equipment, considering the backup and considering the length of assignment of this equipment on offshore rigs, this is creating a pinch on the supply capacity that result into a bowling pricing pressure and pricing uplift that we are seeing in all environments, I would say. Both from existing contracts where we have the opportunity to negotiate and offset more than offset inflation as a new tender and/or direct award where customers want to secure future capacity, the want to secure technology. They want to secure performance, and as such, are accepting directly negotiating pricing increments on existing scope. So we are benefiting from this. The pricing environment is definitely broadening and improving. And we believe that going forward, as we see the inflection of international investment that have started to accelerate in the second half as we anticipate second half international rate of growth will outpace the North America rate of growth, we see that to generate more floor and uplift for the pricing environment going forward.\nChase Mulvehill: Yes, all makes sense, and we agree with you there. Can we \u2013 as a kind of a related follow-up, can you expand on kind of, I guess, maybe your ultimate earnings power of the company? Obviously, you gave us some EBITDA guidance here. And when we think about the earnings for this year, you\u2019ll surpass last cycle\u2019s peak. But how should we be framing kind of the earnings power of Schlumberger this cycle? And then maybe just kind of weave in the discussion around EBITDA margins and your confidence in maybe hitting the 25% mid-cycle margins that you had kind of guided as a target for kind of year-end \u201823, do you think you can kind of hit that a little bit earlier now, given that you\u2019re outperforming on the margin side?\nOlivier Le Peuch: No. I think as we have said before, I think there are two, three reasons why we are confident about our margin trajectory earnings power going forward. First is that we had a high grade in our portfolio in North America that\u2019s lifted our margin in North America to deliver that we are comfortable now, that we are competing and accretive. Secondly, we have created a significant reset in our operating leverage less than 2 years ago that is paying up and paying off at the time we are expanding and growing. And third, we believe that a combination of a tight supply already very visible in North America and broadening, as I said, in international, combined with performance, technology performance, integration performance differentiation, is creating a further premium that will fall through to our earnings. So we have a probable mix outlook that includes offshore. We have differentiating technology and integration performance, and we have the foundation, the operating asset that you have done and the high-grading we did forward. So you combine this with the upside that digital brings to this, and you get all in a significant upside that we have in our margin. And we had anticipated 25% EBITDA margin sometime next year, and I think we are still very confident about that target.\nChase Mulvehill: Okay, perfect. I will turn it back over. Thanks, Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we have a question from Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nArun Jayaram: Yes, good morning, Olivier. Obviously, some concerns around Russia kind of heading into the print. But I was wondering if you could provide more color on the drivers of the 20% sequential top line growth that you saw in Europe/CIS/Africa that manifested despite a decline in Russian revenue?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think it\u2019s built on multiple units in West Africa and Europe and Scandinavia, to a lesser extent, that has been benefiting from project timing from \u2013 partially in the production system that you have seen has benefited from a significant sequential growth. A large portion of it was in Europe. The same in offshore brand, I think we have offshore brands picking up in that region. And this has been very beneficial to us, including some explore into our performance. So you combine all of this, and we have had a fairly substantial growth, and we don\u2019t see this necessarily abating a lot in the coming quarters. So I think we see a lot of further offshore and activity both in Africa, Europe, Scandinavia accelerating, as I said, next year, and that will more than offset the risk we are facing in Russia outlook.\nArun Jayaram: Great. Great. And just my follow-up, Olivier, you mentioned how Schlumberger is hosting an Investor Day in November, I was wondering if you could talk about some of the objectives of that upcoming event and what do you hope to showcase and highlight to investors at that time?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think we commented on this during the last call. And I think it is an event where we invite investors and analysts to update them on our view first on the cycle, our strategy to execute on this cycle, and our long-term ambition we have for the company, building on our core and our digital and our new energy investment that we go forward. So that\u2019s where \u2013 and you will see technology, you will see I think an element of our strategy, and we will expose all of you to the view we have on the macro and the long-term ambition for the company.\nArun Jayaram: Great, thank you.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Welcome.\nOperator: And our next question is from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNeil Mehta: Good morning, team. First question was just around\u2026\nOlivier Le Peuch: Good morning.\nNeil Mehta: Good morning, Olivier. Just around your Canada APS assets, and how are you thinking about that? Are you still considering the sale? Or has the thought process changed given the macro environment? And alongside that, the monetization of the Liberty position as well. Should we be thinking that Schlumberger will look to continue to exit?\nStephane Biguet:\nArun:\nNeil Mehta: Okay. That\u2019s good. That\u2019s helpful color. And then the second is a philosophical question. Schlumberger is now getting to the point where the business is generating a decent amount of free cash flow and visibility for that free cash flow to grow. How do you think about return of capital? And as you think about the preferred methodology to return that capital, do you think a buyback or a dividend is the most effective way to get that cash back to shareholders?\nStephane Biguet: Sure. Look, first, as you know, we increased our dividend by 40%, starting with the July payment. So this was a first step in increasing returns to shareholders in this growth cycle. Now, as earnings and cash flows indeed continue to grow over the cycle, we will review opportunities constantly to increase returns to shareholders. And it will be either in the form of increased dividends or share repurchases. We will also see exceptional cash proceeds from our continuous portfolio high-grading program, so this will give us further optionality. We will decide between dividends and share repurchases in due time. Dividend, of course, has to be sustainable, affordable for the long-term, but share repurchases will be part of the equation as well.\nNeil Mehta: Thank you, Step.\nStephane Biguet: Thank you.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nScott Gruber: Yes. Good afternoon. Afternoon, afternoon. So as you mentioned there is growing recession fears in the broader market, and that\u2019s weighed on oil and to weight on your stock. But Olivier, as you mentioned, there seems to be great resiliency here to the growth outlook. But I am curious roughly at what oil price do you think the multiyear double-digit recovery could be in Peru [ph]? It just seems like there is a pretty big buffer between the current price and where that price could be. But I am wondering your thoughts on \u2013 I think it\u2019s important.\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think \u2013 first, I think we are living through a supply-led on that. I think it\u2019s quite unique, and it will take time before it recovers towards a demand supply balance. So, I think the quarters to come will be definitely quarters to be replenishing and securing enough spare capacity to avoid the exposure, the overexposure to risk on the energy supply. And \u2013 but you have the undercurrent that is on energy security that is clearing. And double sourcing, that is a new attribute of demand that \u2013 and supply, sorry, on supply that is doubling down. So, I think the buffer is pretty wide, in my opinion. And hence, the short-term and some of the risk on the slowing and/or inflection into the demand growth going forward, there is a decoupling and there is resilience into the investment cycle that we are seeing as we speak. So, whether this last, it\u2019s very difficult to say how long it will last. But I think we see that this cycle is stronger, longer and pricier than we had anticipated because of those unique conditions that the security supply has just added a new dimension to it. So, I think there is a lot of space in my opinion.\nScott Gruber: Yes, we agree. And a follow-up on exploration, I know you touched on it and touched on its benefiting mix. But I am curious just how you see the recovery here on the exploration side, this cycle? The general assumption coming in was that exploration would lag. But just given a deep downturn in exploration activity and given a renewed focus on energy security, should we now be assuming that exploration activity will actually rise in excess of the general recovery as it usually is? Is that possible here?\nOlivier Le Peuch: No. What we are witnessing actually is that below the screen, if I may use that expression, is that we are seeing a lot of exploration and appraisal program that has been \u2013 that are being initiated with some good supplies that we are seeing in the new frontier. I call it in Namibia, call it in Colombia, all over place. And we are seeing program and support for new exploration in Asia as well. So, yes, we are cautiously optimistic that indeed, the exploration cycle is back to a scale that I think will be accretive to our mix, and will be giving us the unique exposure from our exploration data licensing and/or from our reserve performance portfolio and digital also as we typically have a lot of license and digital solutions that address the explorations, sound workflows. So, we see this as a mix that is accretive to our future, and that is coming a little bit ahead of what we could have anticipated in this cycle.\nScott Gruber: Appreciate that color. Thank you.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nRoger Read: Yes. Thank you. Good morning and good afternoon.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Good morning Roger.\nRoger Read: Yes, what I would like to maybe understand and focusing on kind of the back half and the exit this year on the EBITDA guidance, didn\u2019t really raise that despite the stronger Q2, obviously, some positives on pricing. I was just wondering what you see to keep you, I don\u2019t know if cautious is the right term, but let\u2019s just say conservative in terms of EBITDA guidance relative to revenue guidance, is that Russia or something else that\u2019s flowing through?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think first, let me reiterate the guidance we provided. We provided the guidance that revenue will be a full year of $27 million at least, and we provided a guidance that our EBITDA in dollar terms will grow by at least 25% year-on-year throughout from 2021. So, if you use this, you see that it goes up above the current consensus and have been adjusted for the actual bid that we had in the second quarter. So, we foresee a raise in the EBITDA dollar for the full year with this guidance that I just shared.\nRoger Read: Yes. I understand that. I guess I was just really coming at the sort of \u2013 the up 200 basis points from Q2 \u2013 Q4 of \u201821 to Q4 of \u201822. Given the\u2026\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yes. This is still our ambition, and I think this ambition is based on the seasonal impact that we anticipate through a particular digital year-end sales that will follow our digital form. And the mix that we believe will be favorable. So, we include international and offshore that are accelerating in the second half. So, this is still the ambition we have set for the team. And this is the reason why we have guided to the 25% of full year EBITDA growth in dollar terms or higher.\nRoger Read: Okay. And then this is a little more of a \u2013 especially given the commentary earlier about best quarter since back in \u201815, and this is a cycle where a lot of the E&P companies integrated are being conservative in terms of their pace of spending increase relative to what we see in the commodity prices. I was just wondering, as you look at this cycle of this part of the recovery so far, what you can see in the back half of this year, thinking about next. What looks the same, what looks different? I mean obviously, you expect the exploration recovery to continue. But if we just look at the, call it, development side, are we leaning more heavily into that? Is the mix more positive than in some other cycles, or should it ultimately look a lot like any other cycle, just \u2013 it\u2019s going to be stronger in one place, weaker in other?\nOlivier Le Peuch: No. I think what is quite characterize the cycle is the broad nature of this cycle. We see it \u2013 we are growing across the four divisions. We are growing across the four areas, and we are seeing this set to continue. So, we see, as I said, a strong inflection in international that will outpace in terms of rate of growth in North America from the second half. We see also offshore, the return of offshore being a characteristic that will only expand going forward. The \u2013 if you were to just look at the \u2013 in terms of numbers, the number of jack-up big operating in shallow waters is actually on par higher than it has been for the previous cycles, more than 300, and deepwater is starting to catch up. So, I think we have a \u2013 we have a mix of signal that are clearly broadening the activity outlook. Hence, if I want to differentiate, it\u2019s more the supply-led and tightness of the market, creating pricing condition that is unique in this cycle in addition to the broad nature of growth across almost all countries in this \u2013 in the coming quarters. Positive in all, yes. It\u2019s positive in all dimensions, I would say customers, geographies and division business line. So, that\u2019s what we foresee is unique. And it\u2019s both, it\u2019s production enhancement, it\u2019s some appraisal acceleration, and it\u2019s a development program, both oil and gas.\nRoger Read: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we will move on to Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nConnor Lynagh: Yes. Thanks. We have been talking a lot about pricing, but I wanted to maybe just put a finer point on something. One of the big investor concerns on both Schlumberger and the broader oil services industry is the degree to which you will be able to extract pricing or improve margins not just in some of the less core geographies, but also with some of your big national oil customers. So, I am curious, based on how broad-based your comments have suggested pricing is, are you already seeing pricing or margins improve in some of your biggest regions with some of your biggest customers? Are your conversations indicating that more is to come? Just curious if you could address that.\nOlivier Le Peuch: No. As I commented before, it\u2019s broad. It\u2019s happening today and it\u2019s expanding. So, now is it in \u2013 for every contract, for every customer, and that\u2019s what we are working on. But the customer understands, the customer realized that the market is becoming suddenly tight. The customer care for performance. The customer wants to secure capacity for their future plan. And hence, we are seeing success into our engagement with all of our customers into a positive response and adjustment of our price in the existing contract or into new contract. Into, as I said, a contract expansion that are negotiated one-on-one and with pricing increments or \u2013 and into tender environment where the pricing is seeing it. So, it\u2019s broad, and it will continue to happen. And I think while \u2013 a year ago, it was mostly in North America with shops internationally. I would say that it\u2019s very established in North America, and it\u2019s broad now in International across all customers. And yes, some will take more time to materialize and some will face at a later date, but we are confident that the momentum has started and the market will support it going forward.\nConnor Lynagh: Got it. Thank you. Maybe pivoting a little bit here. We have talked tangentially about Russia, but I was wondering if you could just clarify what your expectations are for the country, for your operations there? And effectively, what the wind-down might look like relative to your plans to cease investment in the new contracts there?\nOlivier Le Peuch: No, I think I would just reiterate what we said earlier and bring a little bit of clarity. But our position is unchanged since we communicated earlier this year at the onset of this crisis, and we have suspended new investment and technology deployment into Russia. However, our structure gives us the flexibility to have operation in country in full compliance with international sanctions. So, at the same time, we continue to monitor the situation very, very closely, very carefully. And we always put the safety of our people and assets as a first priority. So, we cannot and will not comment on the future, but we have taken a disposition to support.\nConnor Lynagh: Alright. Thank you very much.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one last question. That is from Keith MacKey with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nKeith MacKey: Hi. Good day everyone.\nStephane Biguet: Hi. Good morning.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Good morning Keith.\nKeith MacKey: Hi. Just would like to dig into a little bit more on the cash flow and free cash flow expectations for the second half of the year. Stephane, you mentioned that you expect that to improve. Just curious if you can put some color or magnitude around that and is a double-digit free cash flow margin for the second half of the year in the cards?\nStephane Biguet: Sure. So look, first, let me come back to the second quarter to put some color. Our free cash flow was indeed slightly negative, even though the cash flow from operations improved sequentially. So, as you have seen, it\u2019s all in the working capital. And to give a bit more details, two-thirds of the sequential working capital increase was due to an increase in receivables. But as I mentioned earlier, our DSO improved sequentially. So, really, the increase in receivables is due to the significantly higher activity we experienced in the quarter. Also, the inventory has increased, as I mentioned. We are preparing to fulfill our growing backlog, particularly in our Production Systems division. We mentioned this is the fastest-growing division, so we want to seize all the opportunities there. So, really, the working capital buildup we saw this quarter is to support the accelerated growth we are experiencing. As it relates to the rest of the year, we do expect the same pattern we see every year in the second half, where our working capital gradually improves on higher customer collections. Then we have lower inventories due to higher product sales towards the second half. So, we fully expect our free cash flow to significantly improve in the second half as per historical trends. And clearly, we maintain our ambition to generate double-digit free cash flow margin over the cycle for sure.\nKeith MacKey: Got it. Okay. Thanks for that. And maybe just a follow-up on capital, it looks like you moved to the top end of your $1.9 billion to $2 billion range. Can you talk about where this was? Is it activity driven versus inflation driven? It\u2019s ultimately where you think you will land for the year under your $27 billion revenue guidance?\nStephane Biguet: So, just \u2013 yes. Just to confirm, we are expecting our total capital investments, which include the CapEx, exploration, data cost and APS investments for the full year to be approximately $2 billion. As Olivier highlighted clearly we are seeing higher demand for technology and equipment, mostly in our core service division. This is where the most of the CapEx goes, well construction and reservoir performance. We are recording very strong year-on-year growth, so this is expected to continue. So, we will continue, of course, to maintain discipline in the way we deploy any additional resource, allocating those to the countries and contracts with the best returns in accordance with our capital to framework. So, just one note, the CapEx portion of our total capital investment remains at the low end of our target range of 5% to 7% revenue, and we fully intend to maintain that commitment throughout the growth cycle.\nKeith MacKey: Perfect. Thank you very much for the color.\nStephane Biguet: Thank you.\nOperator: And I do understand we have time for one more. That is Marc Bianchi with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nMarc Bianchi: Hello. Thank you. I wanted to ask first on Russia, just to follow-up. I think last you updated, Russia was about 5% of total company revenue, but at the time, the ruble had significantly devalued. We have seen an appreciation in the ruble since. Can you comment on where that revenue mix is today?\nStephane Biguet: Yes. Mark, sorry. Russia, throughout the first six months of 2022, is actually \u2013 is about 5% of our total worldwide revenue.\nMarc Bianchi: Got it. Okay. Thank you, Stephane. As we look at the back half of the year, perhaps you could provide a little more color on the segments. I understand you mentioned D&I and production systems driving the improvement, but the D&I benefit would be largely fourth quarter, which is typical with seasonality, But there was an exceptional second quarter, so maybe you could just provide a little more color on the progression as we move through third quarter for the business?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yes, we have indeed a very strong quarter in D&I due to some very strong data exploration sales. But at the same time, I think we will see indeed the D&I coming back to restoring its usual margin to low to mid-30s and to progress through the H2 to finish on a strong end of the year through the effect of digital year sales as well experienced in previous years. So, while it was very strong, I think it\u2019s still in the 30s, and we expect to keep it in the 30s, if not in the mid-30s going forward. So, we will see the uptick in the end of the year.\nMarc Bianchi: Very good. Thank you so much.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Marc. It\u2019s time to close indeed, thank you. So, ladies and gentlemen, to conclude, let me share with you three key takeaways. Firstly, as our second quarter results demonstrate, our differentiated global market position, our industry-leading performance and our technology portfolio uniquely matched to the market dynamics of this cycle. Secondly, the market fundamentals continue to support significant investment growth in our sector with an anticipated decoupling and resilience against the uncertainty of the pace of future demand growth. At the same time, the market conditions are increasingly supportive of net pricing impact on to current and true-to-contract both in North America and internationally. Finally, our confidence in the activity mix outlook for the second half, particularly the rotation of investment internationally, combined with pricing tailwinds, has led us to revise our full year expectation for both the revenue and earnings growth. This bodes extremely well for our future beyond year-end as we continue to secure significant service and equipment backlog to support our ambition in this up-cycle. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe there is no better time fortunately as we continue to execute with much success, our returns focused strategy and are set to continue to outperform in a market increasingly aligned with our strengths. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Olivier and good morning ladies and gentlemen. Second quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.50. This represents an increase of $0.16 sequentially and $0.20 when compared to the second quarter of last year. This also represented the highest quarterly earnings per share since the fourth quarter of 2015. In addition, during the first quarter, we recorded a $0.14 gain relating to the further sale of a portion of our shares in Liberty Energy and a $0.03 gain relating to the sale of certain real estate, which brought our GAAP EPS to $0.67. Overall, our second quarter revenue of $6.8 billion increased 14% sequentially. This represented the strongest sequential quarterly growth since 2010. All four divisions experienced double-digit increases. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates had virtually no impact on the sequential revenue increase. Pre-tax operating margins expanded 212 basis points sequentially to 17.1% and EBITDA margins increased 157 basis points to 22.6%. These increases largely reflect the seasonal rebound in activity, a favorable technology mix, particularly on higher offshore activities and strong exploration data licensing sales in our digital and integration division. Margins also increased significantly as compared to the second quarter of last year. Pre-tax segment operating margins increased 279 basis points year-on-year, while adjusted EBITDA margins increased 133 basis points year-on-year. This margin performance is even more notable considering the inflationary headwinds we continue to face. This demonstrates our ability to manage inflation through our supply chain organization as well as through pricing adjustments from our customers. Let me now go through the second quarter results for each division. Second quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $955 million increased 11% sequentially, with margins increasing 570 basis points to 39.7%. These increases were primarily due to higher exploration data licensing sales, including $95 million of transfer fees. Reservoir performance revenue of $1.3 billion increased 10% sequentially, beyond the impact of the seasonal rebound in activity, driven by growth both on land and offshore. Margins improved 143 basis points to 14.6%, primarily as a result of the seasonal recovery and higher offshore and exploration activity. Well Construction revenue of $2.7 million increased 12%, driven by strong growth and improved pricing both internationally and in North America. Margins increased 134 basis points to 17.5% due to the higher activity, combined with a favorable technology mix and improved pricing. Finally, Production Systems revenue of $1.9 billion increased 18% sequentially and margins increased 190 basis points to 9%. Global supply chain and logistics constraints started to abate, resulting in higher product deliveries and backlog conversion. International growth outpaced North America growth and was particularly strong in the Europe/CIS/Africa area. Now turning to our liquidity, during the quarter, we generated \u20ac408 million of cash flow from operations and negative free cash flow of $119 million. Working capital consumed $936 million of cash during the quarter, largely driven by higher receivables due to the significant revenue growth. However, our DSO improved sequentially. Inventory also increased as we continue to manage lead times in anticipation of continuous growth in the second half of the year, particularly in our Production Systems division. Consistent with our historical trends, we expect our working capital and cash flow generation to significantly improve over the second half of the year. During the quarter, we made capital investments of $527 million. This amount includes CapEx and investments in APS projects and seismic exploration data. Although it is reflected outside the free cash flow, our overall cash position was enhanced by the further sale of a portion of our shares in Liberty, which generated $430 million of net proceeds. We currently hold a 12% interest in Liberty. During the quarter, we also sold certain real estate, which resulted in proceeds of $120 million. As a result, our net debt improved by $406 million during the quarter to $11 billion. This level of net debt represented a $2 billion improvement compared to the same period last year. Furthermore, we have now achieved our previously stated leverage target of 2x net debt-to-EBITDA. We expect our leverage to continue decreasing throughout the rest of the year on a combination of higher earnings and improved free cash flow, allowing us to further strengthen our balance sheet. This will provide us with the financial flexibility required to continue funding growth and increased returns to shareholders throughout the cycle. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier. Arun: Sure. Look, first, as you know, we increased our dividend by 40%, starting with the July payment. So this was a first step in increasing returns to shareholders in this growth cycle. Now, as earnings and cash flows indeed continue to grow over the cycle, we will review opportunities constantly to increase returns to shareholders. And it will be either in the form of increased dividends or share repurchases. We will also see exceptional cash proceeds from our continuous portfolio high-grading program, so this will give us further optionality. We will decide between dividends and share repurchases in due time. Dividend, of course, has to be sustainable, affordable for the long-term, but share repurchases will be part of the equation as well. Thank you. Hi. Good morning. Sure. So look, first, let me come back to the second quarter to put some color. Our free cash flow was indeed slightly negative, even though the cash flow from operations improved sequentially. So, as you have seen, it's all in the working capital. And to give a bit more details, two-thirds of the sequential working capital increase was due to an increase in receivables.

And clearly, we maintain our ambition to generate double-digit free cash flow margin over the cycle for sure. So, just \u2013 yes. Just to confirm, we are expecting our total capital investments, which include the CapEx, exploration, data cost and APS investments for the full year to be approximately $2 billion. As Olivier highlighted clearly we are seeing higher demand for technology and equipment, mostly in our core service division.

Thank you. Yes. Mark, sorry. Russia, throughout the first six months of 2022, is actually \u2013 is about 5% of our total worldwide revenue."

            "content": "Thank you, Nd. Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us on the call. In my prepared remarks today, I will cover three topics, starting with our second quarter results and our latest view of the macro environment. Thereafter, I will conclude with our outlook for the second half of the year and its compelling attributes, which are very supportive of our raised guidance for the full year. The second quarter was a defining moment in the overall trajectory of the year, with significant growth in revenue, margin expansion and earnings per share. Our execution was solid, and directionally, all trends were positively in our favor. Strong international activity growth and steady drilling momentum in North America, sustained offshore recovery and the broadening impact of improved pricing. We leverage the power of our core, our global footprint and differentiated technology to seize widening industry activity, demonstrating our ability to capture growth in every land and offshore basin from North America to most remote international basin. This was reflected in the broad dimension of growth in our second quarter results as customers stepped up activity with a focus on increased performance and production. Overall, we effectively harness these positive dynamics and delivery very strong second short quarter revenue and earnings growth. In addition to the details provided in our earnings press release this morning, let me reiterate some performance highlights from the quarter. We recorded 14% revenue increase, the largest sequential revenue increase in more than a decade, as revenue growth exceeded rig count increase, both internationally and in North America. Year-on-year revenue growth accelerated to 20%, further sustaining robust growth momentum with a visible inflection in international markets at 50% growth over same period last year. Growth was very broad across all dimensions: area, divisions, land and offshore, with spending visibly higher across all customer types. Internationally, sequential growth was recorded in all of our Middle East and Asia units and all of Latin America and ECA growth was pervasive across Europe, Scandinavia and West Africa. In North America, we continue to post very solid growth offshore and onshore and on increased drilling and completions activity. The rise of offshore activity, particularly deepwater, was a key driver for our second quarter sequential growth in most regions and in support of all divisions. Globally, all four divisions posted double-digit revenue growth and expanded margins sequentially, resulting in the highest quarterly operating margins level since 2015. In addition, another feature of the quarter was broadening pricing improvement, impacting all divisions, geographies and operating environment. Finally, the quarter also marked a number of new contract wins and an increase in backlog for production systems and our re-equipment business, another leading indicator of the strength of activity pipeline ahead of us. Notably, price improvement is also being reflected in production system backlog, which is significant for its later cycle implication for sustained margins expansion on an overall portfolio basis. To sum up, the second quarter emphasizes our clearly differentiated operational performance, strategic execution and financial results, both in North America and internationally. We have very strong momentum and have secured a solid pipeline of activity ahead of us. I am very proud of the entire Schlumberger team for delivering these exceptional results and demonstrating our unique value proposition for both our customers and our shareholders. Turning now to the macro, first, energy security and urgency to establish more diverse and reliable source of oil and gas supply has become increasingly apparent through the year, exacerbated by the effect of ongoing conflict in Ukraine and a notable increase in periodic supply disruptions in certain regions. Second, supply and excess spare capacity remains very tight as recent OPEC and IEA demand outlooks for \u201822 and \u201823 remain constructive, continuing to suggest a call on supply from North America and a more significant call on supply from the international basins. Third, despite near-term concern of a global economic slowdown, the combination of energy security, favorable breakeven price and urgency to grow long-term oil and gas production capacity will continue to support strong upstream E&P spending growth. Consequently, we are witnessing a decoupling of upstream spending from potential near-term demand volatility, resulting in resilient global oil and gas activity growth in 2022 and beyond. Additionally, the factors supporting pricing tailwinds, more specifically the tightening service supply capacity, both in NAM, and increasingly, in international markets, will continue to operate on the defining characteristics of this up-cycle and will support both revenue growth and margin expansion, more than offsetting inflation. Looking more specifically at the second half of the year, we see very robust activity dynamics characterized by distinct acceleration of investments in the international basins and the continued strengthening of offshore activity as all operators, including IOCs, step-up spending. The energy security situation continues to drive structural activity increase, resulting from the increased focus on short-term production and the mid to long-term capacity expansion across oil and gas plays. In addition, we also expect further exploration and appraisal activity and the pricing dynamics experience so far to add further support to both the growth trajectory and the margins performance during the second half. This positive undercurrent will lead to an attractive mix and an increase in short and long-cycle international projects, complementing already robust short cycle activity in North America. Directionally, during the second half of the year, we expect a strong continuation of growth in the core led by production systems for the rest of the year with Digital & Integration benefiting from typically seasonally strong year end sales. Also and as a result of the rotation of investment towards international basins, we anticipate our highest growth rate during the second half to occur internationally, setting up a very nice backdrop for 2023 by outlook. Based on this, we expect our H2 revenue this year to grow at least high-teens compared to the same period last year. Full year revenue growth will therefore be in the high-teens, consisting revenue of at least $27 billion for 2022. Furthermore, our adjusted EBITDA, in absolute dollar terms, will increase by at least 25% for the full year of 2022 when compared to 2021. Indeed, 2022 is stepping up to be an outstanding year for Schlumberger. The power of our core, our digital and decarbonization leadership and the expensive attribute of this upcycle enabled us to leverage focused North America business with an unparalleled international breadth. The combination of which favorably exposed Schlumberger to durable top line growth, earnings and further margin expansion potential that is unmatched in the sector. Beyond this, the momentum we are building through the second half of the year and the exit rates that we will have achieved bode very well for our 2023 outlook and financial ambition, both of which we will share in more details at our investor conference in November. I look forward to seeing many of you in person at this event. I will now turn the call over to Stephane. Thank you, Stephane. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe we are opening the floor to the questions. Good morning, James. No, first, I want to reinforce that the macro environment we are facing is quite unique. It's a confluence and unprecedented low spare capacity, 8 years of underinvestment in international basins and a call for energy security that is creating a double sourcing of both oil and gas parts of the international basins. So, when you put that together, it trades not only a short cycle impulse on production enhancements to respond to that energy security, but also reinforce the need for expanding oil capacity, accelerating gas development and the entire set of international basis both offshore and onshore benefit from it, right, as we see. So, we have seen an inflection in the sentiment of our customers, both our national company, international oil company and international independent, to respond to that call and turning and accelerating the investments and rotating their investment internationally visibly. So, this is certainly a multi-leg, I will call it, multi-phase, both oil and gas positive environment forward. So, we have seen that Latin America has been the first to benefit from that inflection and we see that continuing going forward as from Guyana to Brazil to Colombia as a short cycle to Argentina as a shale exposed environment. We foresee this to be continuing, including exploration offshore Colombia, our Atlantic margin in Brazil this is set to continue going forward. We are seeing this to rotate in ECA, as you may have seen, more than offsetting the constraints we have in Russia-Ukraine region and creating a superb undercurrent, as I like to call it and all offshore basins in this region. And we have seen it in very strong in Europe, West Africa and Scandinavia with the unique tax incentive set that will start to be kicking in next year will only accelerate that trend, and East Mediterranean or Black Sea will also see continuous growth going forward. So \u2013 and you turn to Middle East and Asia. I think you have a combination of oil capacity commitment increase by both UAE, Saudi, and to a certain extent, Kuwait, that will play out. And well, in the case of KSA, create an uptick in offshore activity partly from next year. You see that the gas that is being developed at large scale in Middle East, both for domestic and for fuel substitution, that will continue to play to our strength in Qatar and commercial in both UAE and Saudi, Oman. And then you have the Asia market. That is also not shy of investments, and you see that long-term into the South China Sea as well. So I think it's multi-branch, multi-color, I would say, and it has started strong in line, and we will turn to your further ECA, further Middle East with inflection have been materialized as the quarter executed going forward. No, I think you are correct. And I think the number and the rich panels that we are assembling into this digital forum in September, is there for the reason. First and foremost is because the industry believes in digital, that digital can add a significant step-up in efficiency that will continue to impact positively cost cash generation and will contribute to decarbonization of operations. So that's the reason why we are seeing customer coming in the high number and record number to our digital form. And the second reason we have this success is our thought leadership and platform strategy that has been adopted and that has been the cornerstone of our success in digital, and we are using it to continue to transition all of our customer base towards this cloud platform. And this is a long tail, and this will certainly last all this decade and beyond, and we are looking forward to success, long success here. But also, we are using this platform and the digital capability to continue to enhance our operation, to continue to transform our digital operations, to impact our customers and our operations for efficiency and for performance. So, lifting up through efficiency, lifting up the performance and hence getting a premium or getting an increment of market position. So, it has a dual effect. But the success of digital form is certainly the credit to our team, but also the proof that digital is now mainstream into this industry. Welcome. No. I think I believe that our team has improved its execution track record. We have, as you may remember, 3 years ago, we took some action on to our underperforming contracts. And we learned and applied some best practice, best lessons and project management to technology deployment and to the discipline in our competency management deployment and use of digital to help us execute this contract in a better way. And from the way we manage the maintenance cycle of our equipment to the way we deploy and do remote operation to control and help and support people on the ground, I think we have progressed a lot in the last few years. And as such, the major contract we are starting always has \u2013 have a learning period. But I think we are accelerating this learning period by contrast to previous cycle. And I think we are set for success on all this project before soon. And \u2013 but we always have somewhere, somehow, in international basin, in a major project start-up. And \u2013 but we expect this to be, I would say, the background that we will have going forward, but our execution, practical lesson learned, use of digital, best practice and disciplined organization, including our competency that we deploy, has helped us to accelerate the lesson learned and to reach maturity in terms of performance, margins on those projects faster than the income second. So I'm positive. And as I said, there is an inflection building up in Middle East activity that will materialize in two or three countries visibly into the second half, and will accelerate next year as we will see more offshore shallow activity partially into the VCC environment in Middle East led by the Saudi oil major development that they are accelerating for oil capacity increase towards their 2027 1 million barrel. This will translate into activity. So further activity increase will materialize, and we will benefit from it. The industry will certainly have a large ramp-up going forward. So it's the early cycle of growth in Middle East. No, it's not too soon. In the second quarter, international, offshore was accretive to our growth, International, visibly, and you can see it into the ECA growth. And I think if you read some of the reports published by and others, I think you see that \u2013 you see that the outlook for 2022, 2025 on offshore investments and FID activity will outpace visibly at 2016-2019 cycle. So we have early innings of this offshore cycle, but it's quite interesting. And it includes more exposure or more appraisal activity than we could have anticipated considering the \u2013 some of the macro, but we are seeing it from Namibia to Colombia to Asia. We are seeing interesting exploration happening to north of Brazil in the Atlantic Margin. We are seeing acceleration of appraisal and exploration that combined and increase the beneficiary mix, I would say, that we are seeing in offshore environment. So yes, we are very, very close, as we recently commented doing a conference in June. We were \u2013 we believe that the average revenue intensity that we collect from an offshore environment is \u2013 can be up to 5x or more what we collect in the land environment. And the scope that we have is quite unique from, as you said, from subsea to exploration, from data licensing to integrated rig and well construction. So it's quite unique, and we will benefit increasingly on that offshore outlook. Thank you, David. No, it's definitively broadening. As activity continues to ramp up and includes an offshore mix that typically has more pull on equipment, considering the backup and considering the length of assignment of this equipment on offshore rigs, this is creating a pinch on the supply capacity that result into a bowling pricing pressure and pricing uplift that we are seeing in all environments, I would say. Both from existing contracts where we have the opportunity to negotiate and offset more than offset inflation as a new tender and/or direct award where customers want to secure future capacity, the want to secure technology. They want to secure performance, and as such, are accepting directly negotiating pricing increments on existing scope. So we are benefiting from this. The pricing environment is definitely broadening and improving. And we believe that going forward, as we see the inflection of international investment that have started to accelerate in the second half as we anticipate second half international rate of growth will outpace the North America rate of growth, we see that to generate more floor and uplift for the pricing environment going forward. No. I think as we have said before, I think there are two, three reasons why we are confident about our margin trajectory earnings power going forward. First is that we had a high grade in our portfolio in North America that's lifted our margin in North America to deliver that we are comfortable now, that we are competing and accretive. Secondly, we have created a significant reset in our operating leverage less than 2 years ago that is paying up and paying off at the time we are expanding and growing. And third, we believe that a combination of a tight supply already very visible in North America and broadening, as I said, in international, combined with performance, technology performance, integration performance differentiation, is creating a further premium that will fall through to our earnings. So we have a probable mix outlook that includes offshore. We have differentiating technology and integration performance, and we have the foundation, the operating asset that you have done and the high-grading we did forward. So you combine this with the upside that digital brings to this, and you get all in a significant upside that we have in our margin. And we had anticipated 25% EBITDA margin sometime next year, and I think we are still very confident about that target. Thank you. I think it's built on multiple units in West Africa and Europe and Scandinavia, to a lesser extent, that has been benefiting from project timing from \u2013 partially in the production system that you have seen has benefited from a significant sequential growth. A large portion of it was in Europe. The same in offshore brand, I think we have offshore brands picking up in that region. And this has been very beneficial to us, including some explore into our performance. So you combine all of this, and we have had a fairly substantial growth, and we don't see this necessarily abating a lot in the coming quarters. So I think we see a lot of further offshore and activity both in Africa, Europe, Scandinavia accelerating, as I said, next year, and that will more than offset the risk we are facing in Russia outlook. I think we commented on this during the last call. And I think it is an event where we invite investors and analysts to update them on our view first on the cycle, our strategy to execute on this cycle, and our long-term ambition we have for the company, building on our core and our digital and our new energy investment that we go forward. So that's where \u2013 and you will see technology, you will see I think an element of our strategy, and we will expose all of you to the view we have on the macro and the long-term ambition for the company. Welcome. Good morning. Thank you. I think \u2013 first, I think we are living through a supply-led on that. I think it's quite unique, and it will take time before it recovers towards a demand supply balance. So, I think the quarters to come will be definitely quarters to be replenishing and securing enough spare capacity to avoid the exposure, the overexposure to risk on the energy supply. And \u2013 but you have the undercurrent that is on energy security that is clearing. And double sourcing, that is a new attribute of demand that \u2013 and supply, sorry, on supply that is doubling down. So, I think the buffer is pretty wide, in my opinion. And hence, the short-term and some of the risk on the slowing and/or inflection into the demand growth going forward, there is a decoupling and there is resilience into the investment cycle that we are seeing as we speak. So, whether this last, it's very difficult to say how long it will last. But I think we see that this cycle is stronger, longer and pricier than we had anticipated because of those unique conditions that the security supply has just added a new dimension to it. So, I think there is a lot of space in my opinion. No. What we are witnessing actually is that below the screen, if I may use that expression, is that we are seeing a lot of exploration and appraisal program that has been \u2013 that are being initiated with some good supplies that we are seeing in the new frontier. I call it in Namibia, call it in Colombia, all over place. And we are seeing program and support for new exploration in Asia as well. So, yes, we are cautiously optimistic that indeed, the exploration cycle is back to a scale that I think will be accretive to our mix, and will be giving us the unique exposure from our exploration data licensing and/or from our reserve performance portfolio and digital also as we typically have a lot of license and digital solutions that address the explorations, sound workflows. So, we see this as a mix that is accretive to our future, and that is coming a little bit ahead of what we could have anticipated in this cycle. Thank you. Good morning Roger. I think first, let me reiterate the guidance we provided. We provided the guidance that revenue will be a full year of $27 million at least, and we provided a guidance that our EBITDA in dollar terms will grow by at least 25% year-on-year throughout from 2021. So, if you use this, you see that it goes up above the current consensus and have been adjusted for the actual bid that we had in the second quarter. So, we foresee a raise in the EBITDA dollar for the full year with this guidance that I just shared. Yes. This is still our ambition, and I think this ambition is based on the seasonal impact that we anticipate through a particular digital year-end sales that will follow our digital form. And the mix that we believe will be favorable. So, we include international and offshore that are accelerating in the second half. So, this is still the ambition we have set for the team. And this is the reason why we have guided to the 25% of full year EBITDA growth in dollar terms or higher. No. I think what is quite characterize the cycle is the broad nature of this cycle. We see it \u2013 we are growing across the four divisions. We are growing across the four areas, and we are seeing this set to continue. So, we see, as I said, a strong inflection in international that will outpace in terms of rate of growth in North America from the second half. We see also offshore, the return of offshore being a characteristic that will only expand going forward. The \u2013 if you were to just look at the \u2013 in terms of numbers, the number of jack-up big operating in shallow waters is actually on par higher than it has been for the previous cycles, more than 300, and deepwater is starting to catch up. So, I think we have a \u2013 we have a mix of signal that are clearly broadening the activity outlook. Hence, if I want to differentiate, it's more the supply-led and tightness of the market, creating pricing condition that is unique in this cycle in addition to the broad nature of growth across almost all countries in this \u2013 in the coming quarters. Positive in all, yes. It's positive in all dimensions, I would say customers, geographies and division business line. So, that's what we foresee is unique. And it's both, it's production enhancement, it's some appraisal acceleration, and it's a development program, both oil and gas. No. As I commented before, it's broad. It's happening today and it's expanding. So, now is it in \u2013 for every contract, for every customer, and that's what we are working on. But the customer understands, the customer realized that the market is becoming suddenly tight. The customer care for performance. The customer wants to secure capacity for their future plan. And hence, we are seeing success into our engagement with all of our customers into a positive response and adjustment of our price in the existing contract or into new contract. Into, as I said, a contract expansion that are negotiated one-on-one and with pricing increments or \u2013 and into tender environment where the pricing is seeing it. So, it's broad, and it will continue to happen. And I think while \u2013 a year ago, it was mostly in North America with shops internationally. I would say that it's very established in North America, and it's broad now in International across all customers. And yes, some will take more time to materialize and some will face at a later date, but we are confident that the momentum has started and the market will support it going forward. No, I think I would just reiterate what we said earlier and bring a little bit of clarity. But our position is unchanged since we communicated earlier this year at the onset of this crisis, and we have suspended new investment and technology deployment into Russia. However, our structure gives us the flexibility to have operation in country in full compliance with international sanctions. So, at the same time, we continue to monitor the situation very, very closely, very carefully. And we always put the safety of our people and assets as a first priority. So, we cannot and will not comment on the future, but we have taken a disposition to support. Thank you. Good morning Keith. Yes, we have indeed a very strong quarter in D&I due to some very strong data exploration sales. But at the same time, I think we will see indeed the D&I coming back to restoring its usual margin to low to mid-30s and to progress through the H2 to finish on a strong end of the year through the effect of digital year sales as well experienced in previous years. So, while it was very strong, I think it's still in the 30s, and we expect to keep it in the 30s, if not in the mid-30s going forward. So, we will see the uptick in the end of the year. Thank you, Marc. It's time to close indeed, thank you. So, ladies and gentlemen, to conclude, let me share with you three key takeaways. Firstly, as our second quarter results demonstrate, our differentiated global market position, our industry-leading performance and our technology portfolio uniquely matched to the market dynamics of this cycle. Secondly, the market fundamentals continue to support significant investment growth in our sector with an anticipated decoupling and resilience against the uncertainty of the pace of future demand growth. At the same time, the market conditions are increasingly supportive of net pricing impact on to current and true-to-contract both in North America and internationally. Finally, our confidence in the activity mix outlook for the second half, particularly the rotation of investment internationally, combined with pricing tailwinds, has led us to revise our full year expectation for both the revenue and earnings growth. This bodes extremely well for our future beyond year-end as we continue to secure significant service and equipment backlog to support our ambition in this up-cycle. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe there is no better time fortunately as we continue to execute with much success, our returns focused strategy and are set to continue to outperform in a market increasingly aligned with our strengths. Thank you very much."

At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, ND Maduemezia. Please go ahead.\nNdubuisi Maduemezia: Thank you, Lea. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Schlumberger Limited First-Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being hosted from Oslo, following the Schlumberger Limited Board meeting held earlier this week. Joining us on the call are Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Executive Officer; and Stephane Biguet, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind all participants that some of the statements we will be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and our other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our first-quarter press release, which is on our website. With that, I will turn the call over to Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, ND. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on the call today. In my remarks, I will cover our first-quarter results and achievements followed by our latest view of the market environment and our outlook for the second quarter and the rest of the year, particularly internationally. Stephane will then give more detail on our financial results, and we will open the floor for your questions. Considering the global context during the first quarter, I am very pleased with our start of the year. Sequentially, the quarter broadly reflected typical seasonal patterns, except for additional effects of the Russian ruble devaluation and a more pronounced sequential decline in Production Systems. Year-on-year, we delivered a strong increase in earnings and revenue growth along with operating margins expansion. Our results were particularly strong in Well Construction and Reservoir Performance, where we are maximizing our leading market positions, our top-tier technology, performance, and enhanced operating leverage to full effect, both internationally and in North America. All Divisions and Areas grew year-on-year, resulting in 14% overall growth. This was achieved through double-digit revenue growth internationally, and by fully capitalizing on our North America exposure with 32% revenue growth. Operating margins expanded in both North America and in the international markets, and we start the year with the highest first-quarter margins since 2015. This establishes an excellent foundation for our full-year margin expansion ambition. Well Construction and Reservoir Performance, our core services Divisions, had very strong momentum to start the year. In addition, we secured several new multiyear contracts and improving commercial conditions in a number of geographies and services. Digital & Integration also posted double-digit growth compared to the same period last year, with new critical commercial contracts, and significant advance of our digital platform strategy with the launch of our first INNOVATION FACTORI in North America. In Production Systems, our core equipment Division, year-on-year growth was muted by the impact of supply chain bottlenecks, which have pushed deliveries into subsequent quarters. Despite these transitory challenges, I am very pleased with the quality and size of the backlog and orders secured in the past 12 months. With improving supply conditions, I am confident that the execution of our response plan will significantly improve backlog conversion, resulting in an accelerated revenue growth dynamic in the coming quarters. In Russia, the onset of the tragic conflict in Ukraine and corresponding sanctions impacted the later part of the quarter. We swiftly initiated a series of actions to ensure the safety of our people and implemented restrictive measures concerning new investment and technology deployment to our Russia operations. We continue to closely monitor this dynamic situation and remain hopeful for the quick cessation of hostilities. Overall, and despite unique challenges, I am very pleased with the results of the quarter. I would like to extend my thanks to the entire Schlumberger team for successfully navigating these developments and delivering an excellent start to what promises to be a year of solid growth and achievement. Turning now to the macro environment, the energy landscape has evolved significantly over the past few months. Recent events have, on one hand, resulted in a change in the pace of demand recovery, while energy security and supply diversification have also emerged as preeminent global drivers that will shape the future of our industry, in addition to decarbonization, capital discipline, and digital transformation. This new dimension will have long-lasting positive implications for energy investment over the next few years. I would like to share how we see these dynamics developing over the short- and long-term horizons, and more importantly, how these conditions will play to Schlumberger\u2019s differentiated strengths. First, in the short term, commodity prices are elevated, as supply conditions continue to tighten due to the impacts of capital discipline, consistent OPEC+ policy implementation, and the potential impact of supply dislocation from Russia. The industry is responding to this high commodity price environment with accelerated short-cycle investment in North America led by the private producers and a gradual increase in investment by the public operators, albeit tempered by capital discipline and bottlenecks in capacity and supply chain. Internationally, short-cycle investments are set to accelerate with the seasonal rebound in the second quarter and more strongly in the second half of the year, led by the Middle East and the key international offshore basins. Second, the elevation of energy security as a priority will drive further capacity expansion and optionality to deliver a more diverse oil and gas supply. This will support additional long-cycle development projects, exploration activity, and brownfield rejuvenation programs. Third, favorable conditions for product and services net-pricing improvements have clearly emerged and are expanding across both North America and the international markets. This will be a defining characteristic of this upcycle, considering the service sector\u2019s newfound capital discipline and commitment to margin expansion. These improvements are absolutely critical to support returns and investment in capacity that will be needed to deliver on both the short- and long-term oil and gas supply the world needs. The combination of these effects creates an exceptional sequence for our sector, likely resulting in a cycle of higher magnitude and duration than previously anticipated. Schlumberger has led the sector in reinventing itself over the past few years, aligning closely with industry shifts, customer needs, and increased shareholder value. Since launching our performance strategy, we targeted trends that are manifesting today by focusing on the development of fit-for-basin technologies some of which are now unlocking much-needed energy supplies and by reducing or eliminating GHG emissions with our Transition Technologies portfolio and our new end-to-end emissions solutions. We have also expanded manufacturing capacity in key basins, such as in North America and in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, to tailor fit-for-basin technology delivery. In Digital, we are enabling transformation in the sector, establishing the industry digital platform, DELFI; creating more powerful AI solutions; and leading innovation in autonomy. These advances in digital enablement are improving both customer operations and our own efficiency, as we evolve workflows and improve execution with insights from data. Today, Schlumberger is best positioned to capture the benefits of this unique upcycle, given the steady execution of our strategy, breadth of our market presence, leading technology portfolio, and our ability to derive premium pricing through our performance execution and value creation for our customers. Now I would like to share with you our outlook for the second quarter and the second half of the year. Sequentially, we expect a solid quarter of growth in both North America and the international market. Growth in North America will be led by continued short cycle activity, offset by Canadian spring break-up. Internationally, growth will be driven by the seasonal rebound, albeit moderated by the absence of the usual second-quarter uptick in Russia, owing to the uncertainty around the ruble depreciation, impact of sanctions, and customer activity decline. Taken together, this will result in global revenue growth around mid-single-digits for the second quarter. We anticipate the operating margins to expand 50 to 100 basis points, driven by further operating leverage and the positive conditions I have outlined. In that context, our sequential margin expansion trajectory is set to resume and subsequently strengthen in the second half of the year in line with our full-year guidance. Looking further ahead, the second half of the year is shaping up to be particularly strong, based on our view of a significant pipeline of customer activity, upcoming product backlog conversion, and the growing impact of net pricing. This period of the year is typically the strongest half, and 2022 looks to be no exception. While the dynamic situation in Russia and the potential reduction in pace of the demand recovery present near-term concerns, we believe the continued tightness in supply, elevated commodity prices, and supplemental investment intended to diversify oil and gas supply should represent a positive offset for 2022 and beyond. Accordingly, second-half growth will be driven primarily by the international markets, led by the Middle East and key offshore basins. Indeed, the offshore activity, already growing sequentially and visibly year-on-year, will benefit from secular growth in both shallow and deepwater environments as the acceleration of infill drilling and tieback developments will combine with a resurgence of exploration drilling during the summer, and with an acceleration of long-cycle development projects ahead of 2023. Similarly, the Middle East region will benefit from the combination of reinvestment in short-cycle barrels as we approach the end of current OPEC+ agreements and from the commitment to capacity expansion in both oil production and gas developments. Additionally, 2022 is set to benefit from higher discretionary spending and higher product sales and year-end deliveries as customers secure the necessary capacity for their 2023 growth plans. Finally, and critically, we anticipate that net pricing impact will further extend in breadth and scale as the year progresses, to benefit margin expansion during the second half, and become a unique attribute of this upcycle. With this backdrop, and despite the uncertainty linked to Russia, we believe that the favorable market conditions I outlined should allow us to maintain our full-year ambitions of year-on-year revenue growth in the mid-teens, and adjusted EBITDA margins exiting the year at least 200 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2021. I will now turn the call over to Stephane.\nStephane Biguet: Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. First-quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.34. This represents a decrease of $0.07 sequentially and an increase of $0.13 when compared to the first quarter of last year. In addition, during the quarter, we recorded a $0.02 gain relating to the further sale of a portion of our shares in Liberty Oilfield Services, which brought our GAAP EPS to $0.36. Overall, our first-quarter revenue of $6 billion decreased 4% sequentially, while pretax operating margins declined 84 basis points to 15%. These decreases reflect the seasonally lower activity and product sales that we typically experience in the first quarter. The conflict in Ukraine also had an impact on our first-quarter results, although this was largely limited to the effects of the depreciation of the ruble witnessed during the last month of the quarter. While margins were seasonally lower on a sequential basis, they did increase significantly as compared to the first quarter of last year. Pretax segment operating margin increased 229 basis points year-on-year, while company-wide adjusted EBITDA margins of 21% increased 94 basis points year-on-year, despite the inflationary factors we are facing. This reflects the strength of our operating leverage, new technology uptake, and increasing pricing traction. Let me now go through the first-quarter results for each Division. First-quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $857 million decreased 4% sequentially with margins declining 372 basis points to 34%. These decreases were primarily due to the effects of seasonally lower digital and exploration data licensing sales, partially offset by improved contribution from our APS projects in Ecuador, following the pipeline disruption of last quarter. Reservoir Performance revenue of $1.2 billion decreased 6% sequentially while margins declined 232 basis points to 13.2%. These decreases were due to lower activity in Latin America and the seasonal activity reduction in the Northern Hemisphere. Well Construction revenue of $2.4 billion was essentially flat sequentially as seasonal reductions in Europe, Russia, and Asia were offset by strong drilling activity in North America, Latin America, and the Middle East. Margins of 16.2% increased 77 basis points sequentially, despite the flat revenue largely due to improved profitability in integrated drilling projects. Finally, Production Systems revenue of $1.6 billion decreased 9% sequentially and margins decreased 192 basis points to 7.1%. This was due to the effect of lower revenue following the traditionally higher fourth-quarter product sales combined with delayed deliveries and increased logistics costs resulting from global supply chain constraints. These are temporary challenges that we are diligently working to remedy. Once resolved, this will provide for favorable upside to our revenue and margins in future quarters, as our backlog is solid, and we will ultimately return to a normal pace of deliveries. Now, turning to our liquidity. During the quarter, we generated $131 million of cash flow from operations and negative free cash flow of $381 million. Our cash flow generation was seasonally low as a result of the increase in working capital requirements we always experience in the first quarter. In addition to the typical payout of our annual employee incentives in the first quarter, we saw lower cash collections following the exceptional accounts receivable performance of the fourth quarter. Our inventory balance also grew due to the product delivery delays in our Production Systems Division, but also to prepare for project start-ups in the second quarter and for the strong growth anticipated for the rest of the year. In addition, we took the decision to increase our safety stocks and lock in prices on certain long-lead items in order to secure supply and hedge against anticipated cost inflation. Although, it is reflected outside of free cash flow, our overall cash position was enhanced by the further sale of a portion of our shares in Liberty, which generated $84 million of net proceeds. Following this transaction, we hold a 27% interest in Liberty. Our working capital and cash flow will improve each quarter for the rest of the year, consistent with our historical trends and we remain confident in our ability to generate double-digit free cash flow margin on a full-year basis. This will allow us to continue deleveraging the balance sheet and exceed our previously stated leverage target in 2022. Based on this and the strengthening industry outlook that Olivier described earlier, we announced today a 40% increase in our quarterly dividend. The increase will be reflected in our July dividend and will result in approximately $140 million of additional dividend payments in 2022 and $280 million on an annualized basis. This will have a minimal impact on our leverage and we will, of course, remain focused on strengthening the balance sheet. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Stephane. I think we can open the floor to the Q&A session. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of David Anderson with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nDavid Anderson: Hi, good morning, Olivier. What everything has happened over the past few months\u2026\nOlivier Le Peuch: Good morning, David.\nDavid Anderson: Hi, good morning. I look over the next several years for your international business to be a primary beneficiary here. I guess my question is the ramp up of that activity. We\u2019ve seen a lot of NOCs announced contracts, more tenders are on the way. We\u2019ve yet to really see the materials and activity, and we don\u2019t have a ton of visibility on that market. I was just wondering if you could just help us understand what\u2019s happening on the ground there. It seems like it\u2019s just a matter of timing. But are there any challenges that you\u2019re faced with mobilizing equipment and services environment, you\u2019re clearly confident being a second half story, you could just provide a little bit more context into how we\u2019re getting there, please? Thank you.\nOlivier Le Peuch: No. Thank you, Dave. So indeed, first, to put things in context. I think the international growth started to be rebounding last year. I think, as you know, year-on-year in the second half last year, we had already posted more than double-digit growth year-on-year in the second half. You can see that on this quarter, we\u2019re already at 10% growth year-on-year and the majority of our international geounits actually posted double-digit, and quite a few above 20% year-on-year. So clearly the momentum of activity pickup internationally has been initiated, and it\u2019s not only short cycle, it\u2019s short and long cycle as some FID have already been signed last year and more are coming in the way. So now looking ahead and trying to understand how this is hedging in the future. I think, first, there is a dynamic of call on international supply that will continue to happen as the demand recovery is happening and as the market is looking for energy security and enhanced diversification of supply. So international basins at large will benefit from this dynamic in the years to come. Secondly, you have the dynamic of short-cycle response to the tightness of supply as we face today and we will face for the quarter to come, and this will prompt not only activity of cycle in the second half of this quarter and in the subsequent quarter in all the short-cycle basins from Middle East to some short-cycle activity offshore and it will be supplemented in the second half by an acceleration of the long-cycle development. Indeed, we believe that the conditions are set for long- and short-cycle to be contributing at the same time to the supply growth of international market. And long-cycle is not only offshore, long cycle is some large capacity expansion, that national company, majors, are continuing to post. And offshore market, we\u2019ll also see the condition of major and international operator continue to expand their investment. So, we are seeing this happening today. We are seeing this accelerating in the second half visibly as the combination of short and long run benefit the international market. And the OPEC+ as you know is ending their quota distribution at the end of the third quarter and this will unlock short-cycle. If you were to look at Middle East, a few countries have already made a commitment to capacity expansion in 2022 and beyond, and this will be supplementing the short-cycle investment. Offshore, you have seen some FID approval, you have seen some exploration drilling resuming last quarter that would just turn into FID and into subsea and the deepwater activity uptick in the second half and furthermore in 2023. So, the conditions are set, as I said, for both short- and long-cycles to contribute to supply from international basins, and we are very well placed to respond to this considering favorable market exposure to international markets, our market position with NOCs, and our exposure to both major and independents into key basins internationally.\nDavid Anderson: So, Olivier, on the offshore side. You highlighted a number of \u2013 numerous -- offshore awards in the release today. It covered \u2013 I think it covered most regions. This has typically been a very highly margin-accretive business to Schlumberger. I\u2019m just curious how much of this is related to the events of the past few months? Are you seeing projects starting to accelerate? I would think you\u2019d start to see a lot more on the short cycle activity, you\u2019re talking about short versus long, I would think maybe short cycle activity is selling because of this, is that true? Are you starting to see that materialize?\nOlivier Le Peuch: No, I will comment in two sides. First, offshore markets remain very relevant to many of our customers internationally, very relevant. Why? Because the economics of offshore market both shallow and deepwater have improved a lot in the cycle. Secondly, many of these offshore reserves are very well placed from a carbon footprint and I think this is something that plays again to reinvestment and expansion. And, third, I think the technology, the integration capability, and digital have made offshore operations more efficient, more effective, have an impact on short cycle offshore infill drilling, tie back with huge technology differentiation we have there, and exploration -- in near-field exploration on one hand. And secondly shorter, long cycle. That is a characteristic that we see accelerating as the majors and IOCs and some NOC that have unique basin \u2013 advantaged basin. We want to accelerate the FID and we want to accelerate the execution of the FID for contributing supply. And, again, integration capability, technology for performance impact, and digital will all combine to make this a reality. So yes, we have already seen the impact of this, and is only set to accelerate and will not necessarily link to the event happening the last few weeks. The last few weeks event will have the consequence of diversification of supply and security of supply. And this will favor offshore basins as one of the best things that can contribute to the long-term supply security.\nDavid Anderson: Much appreciated. Thank you.\nOlivier Le Peuch: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: And next we have a question from Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Please go ahead\nChase Mulvehill: Hey, good morning, guys.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Good morning, Chase.\nChase Mulvehill: So I wanted to follow-up on Dave\u2019s question here on the international side. I mean, obviously, it appears that this international recovery is going to exceed last cycle\u2019s recovery. So maybe I don\u2019t know, if you want to take a moment and kind of talk about how this will impact pricing and margin. I was actually just digging through some old models and looking at 2006, 2007, 2008 margins, and obviously the industry margins back then were much, much better than they were last cycle. So what do you think it would take for the industry to really get back, and move towards those 2006, 2007, 2008 margins?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think the conditions are set for directionally going there, clearly, and I think you have several factor playing. First, the level of activity expansion globally in every basin for every division is creating the condition for tightness in the capacity of supply, of the service supply and the equipment supply. And these conditions are extremely favorable for pricing power, because our operators, our customers, are looking to secure capacity and to secure delivery assurance as they reinvest into their basins, into their favorable assets to secure this participation to this supply market share. So, first, the pricing movements as I said or the pricing attributes will be a key characteristic of the cycle. Secondly, I believe that the industry has realized that technology can make a huge impact on performance, on carbon footprint, and on digitalization to deliver efficiency that we need to accelerate the cycle and deliver assurance of delivery of these extra barrels. So we believe that we have here the condition for an upside on the technology adoption, an upside on digital transformation of the industry trying to achieve operation automation, achieve drilling autonomy, in terms of operation, and all that will combine in addition to decarbonization. So you have these trends that are new, that will augment the mix effect that this market is giving us today. We have a favorable mix, international and the accretive offshore mix. We have a favorable pull and stretch on capacity of the industry with significant discipline on this side of the industry that will lead to pricing expansion. And finally, you have this adoption of digital, adoption of decarbonization, and adoption of any fit-for-basin performance technology that can make an impact, to deliver, because industry wants to deliver and participate fully to this cycle. So that\u2019s the reason why we are positive on this cycle.\nChase Mulvehill: Okay. If I could follow-up quickly, you started talking about digital a little bit. I mean, there\u2019s obviously, tightening supply chain, you\u2019ve got emerging labor constraints, you\u2019ve got accelerated international growth, over the next 12 to 14 months, and all this should be pretty positive for digital, as the industry kind of searches for ways to do things kind of faster, smarter, and harder. So, with that said, and with that as a backdrop, have you started to see accelerated digital adoption? And if so, what parts of the international market, are you really starting to see accelerated adoption?\nOlivier Le Peuch: No. I think you laid the case very well, I think, digital will be an attribute of efficiency, performance, and transformation in the cycle, no doubt, everybody recognizes it and everybody\u2019s investing towards participating to this digital transformation. We believe with our platform strategy, we have certainly the most compelling offer to the market. And we have been building as you heard before, for the last 3 to 5 years, the foundation of our platform, and we have seen adoption accelerating last year. So year-to-date, I\u2019m very pleased with the performance \u2013 the early performance of the year to our digital business out of our Digital & Integration division. It is already contributing to visible growth year-on-year. All the metrics that we are internally following be it the customer adoption of our DELFI, be it the number of users that are using our cloud-DELFI capability, or be it the number of, the scale and intensity of multicycle, of computing cycle adoption, all these are going sequentially and year-on-year, up. So, adoption is happening, you have seen some enhancements have grown during the quarter. And you continue to see adoption translating into contract and into growth, accretive growth for digital. Finally, I think, as we mentioned into the EPR, we have been announcing a year ago our INNOVATION FACTORI. INNOVATION FACTORI, our digital collaborative center that we have placed strategically and we just integrated the last one yesterday in Oslo, Norway. And we are using these places to expose our customers to the capability of our platform with AI and machine learning using our partner capability, integrating into DELFI. And the customer realized that we can achieve a lot. We have delivered 200 projects collaboratively for customers and the customer understands the power of our platform through this exposure and then come away with the ability to scale for enterprise deployment from this INNOVATION FACTORI capability. So, this is one other dimension of adoption that we see and as part of our offering to the market. So, yes, we are convinced this will be accretive to our growth this year. And this will be also having a fall-through -- a positive fall-through of our margin that will support our margin expansion ambition for the full year.\nChase Mulvehill: Okay, perfect. I appreciate the answer. I\u2019ll turn it back over. Thanks, Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we go to Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nArun Jayaram: Yeah, good morning. Olivier, I wanted to get your perspective on any changes you\u2019re seeing in customer spending behavior related to natural gas. You have very strong international and now U.S. gas prices. And just wanted to get your thoughts if you\u2019re seeing any changes there, particularly given the fact that Russia supplies 155 BCM of gas to Europe.\nOlivier Le Peuch: It\u2019s a very relevant question. I think it\u2019s a very topical subject with the operators, and indeed, we are seeing operators preparing, planning and being ready for accelerating their gas supply to the world market, internationally and in North America as well. I think this is touching all aspects of exploration, development, and production of gas. And we are very pleased for our exposure, our exposure in North America and exposure internationally. Internationally, as you know, we have exposure in conventional gas. And, I think, you have seen some recent announcement of renewing contracts in commercial gas in Saudi, you are fully aware of market exposure in Qatar, that we have benefited for the last 2 years that have already grown visibly to commit more LNG train for supply to the world. And you have seen also that we are going to participate fully and we are participating fully into offshore integrated gas development, similar to what we did a few years back with Zohr in East Mediterranean, we are doing with an asset for fully integrated gas in Turkey in the Black Sea, where we are taking care of everything from development to the gas facility that will be from \u2013 that will deliver our first gas from this. So, we are very well exposed. And finally, unconventional gas internationally in the Middle East, particularly, is getting significant support for regional consumption and you are fully aware of the contract, very large contract, integrated contract, we have with Jafurah in Saudi Aramco. So, the exposure we have on gas is unique, conventional, unconventional, offshore, onshore. So, and finally, if I have to add one dimension of technology onto it, I was very pleased. This week we brought the Board to participate to visit in Norway. And we had the opportunity to visit excellence, our Center of Excellence, for subsea processing in Bergen, Norway, where we are manufacturing all of our processing boosting equipment to serve gas markets in deepwater subsea environment. And in particular, the subsea wet gas compression that will be deployed for Ormen Lange to extend the life of Ormen Lange gas supply to UK for the long run. So, these participate in the energy security, these participate to the gas development and production and we are very pleased with our exposure. So we are seeing signal of acceleration commitment, and we are very well leveraging that for the future.\nArun Jayaram: Right. I appreciate that. My follow up is, I wanted to talk a little bit about cash returns, you increase the dividend quite significantly this quarter, but maybe Olivier or Stephane, you could talk about the framework, you\u2019re thinking about future cash returns and how should we be thinking about further dividend increases from here?\nStephane Biguet: Look, it\u2019s good question. Thank you. Yes, based on the market fundamentals, we highlighted, we do expect to continue generating significant free cash flow throughout the cycle. If those favorable conditions persist, as we currently anticipate, this will clearly allow us to, at the same time, maintain the strong balance sheet to fund new growth opportunities, and look for additional ways to increase shareholder returns throughout the cycle. So, this can take the form of increased dividends, share repurchases, or a combination of both. So, as it relates to a framework, we will, of course, provide further details at our upcoming Capital Market Day. At this moment, we set the dividend that level we are comfortable with to allowing us to balance our continuing deleveraging commitments with the overall capital allocation priorities.\nArun Jayaram: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And next we have a question from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNeil Mehta: Great\u2026\nOlivier Le Peuch: Hey, Neil.\nNeil Mehta: Hey, good morning, team. So first question here is, just more of a logistical question. I think in the back half of this year, the expectation is to do a capital market day. So, one, any update in terms of timing; but secondly, what do you want to achieve at that event? What are the important strategic priorities that you want to discuss with the investment community?\nStephane Biguet: So on the logistical side, Neil, the Capital Market Day will be early November and you\u2019ll receive the invitations pretty soon. I\u2019ll let Olivier comment on the main agenda.\nOlivier Le Peuch: The main agenda, as you know, I think would be to achieve 2 or 3 key elements. The first is to lay out our updated view of the mid- and long-term outlook for our industry. And, of course, the engines that we want to participate fully into, the core, the digital, and new energy, and as such document our view of the market scenario and the way our play will expose us to fully participate in each of these three. The second, obviously, will be to articulate the elements of the strategy that will make you understand the tangible progress we have made, the critical milestones we\u2019ll meet by 2025 or by 2030. And, finally, we\u2019ll document, I will say, our financial ambition, and financial and capital framework to support this ambition of our strategic execution for the next 5 years and with the long horizon of 2030 for a target. So that\u2019s what we are aiming to achieve this Capital Market Day.\nNeil Mehta: Thank you. So we look forward to it. And the follow-up is, can you talk about your exposure to the increased CapEx here at Saudi Aramco and ADNOC, and how you see that trickling across your segments? Where do you expect spending to increase significantly here in across what business lines?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think, generally speaking, I think, it is not only Saudi Aramco, or Saudi and UAE. I think it is the GCC countries, and includes Iraq as well, I think, that set are for a significant rebound in both short cycle to respond to the unlocking the quota at the end of the year and then long cycle with capacity expansion commitments that several countries have made. So, we expect the consequence of that would be, first, in the second half of the year, activity will start to see an uptick in the form of short cycle, and that will affect both Reservoir Performance and Well Construction. And we will see also this expanding into offshore and onshore capacity expansion more into 2023. As you know, several contracts have been put in place to support this capacity expansion by this operator with first and the industry at large. And this will see an acceleration of investment in 2023 that will expand beyond the short-cycle visibly into this new development, new capacity, beyond what is happening today on gas and unconventional happening today in some of the integrated contract we already own. So it\u2019s -- it will be widespread, I would say, and across the --all the divisions as we move into 2023.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks, guys.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we have a question from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nScott Gruber: Yeah. So, I wanted to touch on the new energy outlook here just given how the macro has changed. Obviously, valuations in new energy have come down and your cash flow outlook has improved. So does that mean in the years ahead, we could expect Schlumberger to be investing a bit more aggressively in new energy or with a better outlook for the core, is there less urgency to build out the new energy business? How should we think about that?\nOlivier Le Peuch: No, it remains \u2013 our new energy remains a critical strategic pillar of our long-term strategy. So, we are set to continue to invest into the venture we have created. We are making tactical moves and strategic moves to accelerate organic and inorganic investment. And we continue to monitor the market and continue to hedge and grew exposure to this. So, the market condition that have slightly changed in last few weeks, do not change our view on the new energy outlook. We have been seeing some reinvestments, and you have seen this during the quarter, into geothermal as an alternate source of energy. You have seen that geoenergy being through the Celsius Energy venture that we have created was - is- a domain that was identified by EU, the European Union, to be invested in to substitute gas and hence, to lessen the dependency on single source of supply on gas. And I think you can certainly anticipate and see that CCS at large is growing as an opportunity for oil industry. And for us, as we work not only with industry as you have seen the announcement we made with PETRONAS, but also we are working beyond the industry, as you have seen previous engagement we have and continue to do so. So, I think, we continue to develop and mature the technology, ready for scaling them, and we continue to make organic investments and securing inorganic opportunity to augment our capability into that space.\nScott Gruber: And then you started to touch on my follow-up, which relates to the commercial opportunity and how that developed here going forward. And it does seem like geothermal is going to get a pull here. But can you speak to the other commercial opportunities and how you think those evolve, particularly from a timing and cadence perspective, given the backdrop? Does the commercial opportunity materialize more quickly across carbon capture and hydrogen electrolyzer, etc.\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think, we have been commenting on this before. And, I think, we\u2019ll provide a very comprehensive view at our Capital Markets Day. And, I think, the biggest and long-term bigger potential is both on CCS and hydrogen market, we believe, first and foremost. And believe that the energy storage including lithium processing or extraction, as well as energy, stationary energy storage, as well as geo-energy, geothermal, are certainly shorter-term and mid-term opportunity that we\u2019ll not miss to secure. But we\u2019ll come back with more detail and more, a better framework for you to understand our ambition there.\nScott Gruber: I look forward to it. Thanks for the color.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we go to Connor Lynagh with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nConnor Lynagh: Thank you. Good morning.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Good morning, Connor.\nConnor Lynagh: I wanted to ask about \u2013 thank you. I just wanted to ask about the potential recovery in the back half and particularly OPEC, you were alluding to the cessation of the supply agreement. I guess one thing that surprised us is while there have been some countries that have fallen short of their production targets, OPEC as a group has been able to raise production fairly significantly. And there hasn\u2019t been as significant an increase in the rig count. I appreciate not all activity is captured in the rig count. But has that surprised you, and when do you think we see a sort of catch up? Do we need to return to 2019 activity levels to get to 2019 production levels?\nOlivier Le Peuch: No. First, I think the OPEC+ indeed has been very strict into implementing the policy in respect to the quota. Second, I think with very few exceptions, the GCC has been able to indeed unlock this production without significant, at this moment, significant increase in short cycle activity to support that increase. This will position into necessary investment into supporting the sustained capacity in the coming months. Until then and until now it has been that the production of some critical countries were below their sustained capacity potential, hence the need for reinvesting, the need for accelerating investment, drilling or intervention, was measured and was not necessarily disproportionate compared to the past. I think you will see that transitioning into the second half, and accelerating next year and it will combine with a capacity expansion they have committed to. So they will be a hike in activity on two fronts, the short cycle to this time sustain maximum capacity that is established and an investment that will expand this sustained capacity in the future. So that is set to happen. It wasn\u2019t necessarily a big surprise to us. I think that Middle East was a bit of behind in terms of activity rebound internationally until now, but you will see this catching up in the second half and accelerating in 2023.\nConnor Lynagh: All right. Thank you. That\u2019s helpful context. Maybe just flipping over to the Russia side of things, I\u2019m curious, in your full year revenue growth commentary, what are you contemplating in your Russia operations? Are you expecting significant activity declines? Could you help us frame what the cessation of new investments actually means for your activity levels in the near-term here?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think it\u2019s obviously an extremely dynamic situation. For one, the sanction is certainly having an impact on the Russian economy and our operation will not be immune to this effect. But as currently, currency fluctuation, as you have seen, our customer activity level today or tomorrow. So \u2013 and there is also possibility of further sanction, so the impact of the first quarter, as you have seen, was essentially limited to currency depreciation and dilution. It\u2019s very difficult at the moment to predict what the impact may be in an upcoming quarter considering the uncertainty. On the flip side, as I\u2019ve described, the environment that we see and the dynamics we see in the market, and the anticipated response to this call for energy security is creating the condition to offset this uncertainty and offset this risk. And also, the decision we have made to suspend new investment will mean that we will be able to allocate this CapEx to this upcoming opportunity effective this year, and then being able to capture this upside in activity in this dynamic environment. And as you say, should allow us to offset and keep our financial ambition intact.\nConnor Lynagh: All right. Thank you very much. I\u2019ll turn it back.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you.\nOperator: And next, we go to Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nRoger Read: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Good morning, Roger.\nRoger Read: I would like to ask 2 questions that are more or less margin focused, the first on Production Systems, which obviously is lagging, for obvious reasons. But if we don\u2019t get a strong subsea or offshore deepwater recovery, what else can we expect that would lift the Production Systems margins as we go forward?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think there are 2 elements I think we need to-- we should really -- separate here. The first is the transitory temporary impact we have had on the excessive cost of logistics, and delivery supply chain bottleneck that we have to work through that had led to temporary costs that I think will over time abate and will reduce as we work through this supply chain. We have a corrective action plan with diversification of source of supply, using different logistics routes, and you heard about our commitment to some critical safety stock for inventory to secure less disruption going forward. So, this disruption aside, that has had consequential cost, supplementary cost impact, I think we expect this to be more subdued, as we go forward and we start to accelerate our conversion of our backlog. So what do we need? I think we have already this in the backlog. We have a very big backlog that we have accumulated for the last few quarters, that we keep growing. And it\u2019s not only subsea. Our Production Systems is made of subsea, as I mentioned, I think we are very proud of some of our market position in subsea, including what we have seen in Norway, but also have a completion with a few contracts that we won in the Middle East, in Brazil, in particular, artificial lift, PCP pumps that you have seen that we have won just in Kuwait, with very good position; Production chemicals that are being pulled as well. And our midstream and surface Cameron capability that are fully leveraging, particularly surface, the upcycling in North America. So if you combine all of these, we have not only short-cycle exposure with surface in North America of completions, artificial lift, we have long cycle with deepwater, and some of our long-cycle participation into some gas facility, as I mentioned, in Turkey. You combine all this and you have enough backlog to lift and create an uplift into our growth going forward and actually indicative of Production Systems to be accretive to our growth in the second half.\nRoger Read: Thanks for that, that was very helpful. The other question I have is a little bit more far reaching. But as we think about, or let me say, the base case is let\u2019s assume what\u2019s happened in Russia stays as is, the sanctions, everything like that, through the middle of the decade, spending in other parts of the world is going to have to increase to make up for lost Russian production at a minimum lost Russian growth if not absolute lost barrels. And, I was wondering, as you look at your margins and you think about sort of an equal distribution of that spending or that production growth in other parts of the world, should it be no impact on Schlumberger\u2019s margins, a modest positive, or a modest negative if Russia becomes a shrunken market and some of these other areas have to grow in response.\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think, I will not try to compare Russia margin with the rest of our portfolio. I think, I will look at it from strength of the cycle, from the lead market position we have, and from the starting point we have today with having restructured and reset operating leverage, the exposure with digital, the exposure with an increasing offshore long- and short-cycle mix; I think these attributes that convince us that our margin will continue to expand. As we have seen this quarter, we have increased year-on-year, both NAM and international margin. And we have been posting the best margin since, then, 2015. And, yet, despite an impact in the first quarter from Russia. So I think we\u2019re looking at it, as you say, the big picture. The big picture includes investment in oil and gas for energy security, diversification that will have a call on international supply as well as in North America, and an increasing mix of short and long cycle as capacity needs to be expanded and the reserves that have been depleted through the last down-cycle for the last seven years will need to be expanded again. So that mix is what makes us confident into our trajectory of margin expansion, and into the potential uniqueness of this upcycle compared to past, and hence the confidence we have in a short- and long-term.\nRoger Read: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And, ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one last question that\u2019s from the line of Ian Macpherson with Piper Sandler. One moment, please. And please go ahead, sir.\nIan Macpherson: Thank you. Good afternoon in Oslo. Just wanted to wrap up, Olivier, I wanted to ask directly, what is your view of the production trajectory for Russia, assuming the sanctions are what we see today, I know that you don\u2019t want to be too specific with regard to the cadence of your impact over the course of this year. But do you subscribe to the idea that that at best Russia pivots from a steady grower to a steady decliner under the current sanctions regime?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think, I cannot be speculating on this market condition. I think you see the same numbers as we do see. You see that there is, as I said, a potential risk of Russia supply dislocation. I think what is important is that the demand trajectory, that is recovering, and is set to further increase next year, compared to previous prediction, not only to offset that, but to also respond to the market, I think, will be contributing to overall growth, so it\u2019s very difficult to predict. I think, we are \u2013 this is a very dynamic situation. And we are not here to speculate on that dynamic situation. We know that we have to account for assumption that it could be a demand dislocation. It could be a demand, or supply disruption from the Russia source of supply. Hence we know and we have seen our customer rotating and starting to anticipate and position themselves for participating to the call on supply that will happen from the second half of this year and the years to come. So that\u2019s the only thing we can come up with.\nIan Macpherson: That\u2019s a perfectly fair answer. But maybe put otherwise, how critical would you say that Schlumberger and your Western OFS peers are relative to the domestic Russian OFS industry with regard to their ability to lean on internal OFS resources as opposed to a Western technology and kit?\nOlivier Le Peuch: So, again, we cannot speculate on this. I think, we -- our first and foremost priority is to look after the safety of our people, everywhere we operate, including Russia, and to comply with the utmost diligence to the sanction \u2013 international sanctions that are in place. To speculate about what are the consequences of the sanction onto the OFS industry in Russia, I think, is something that the future will tell us what is happening. But, I think, I don\u2019t want to be in a position to comment on this at this moment.\nIan Macpherson: Fair enough. But thanks for all the other answers today. I appreciate it.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you very much. I believe that it\u2019s time to close this call. So, in conclusion, I would like to leave you with 3 takeaways. Firstly, our first-quarter financial results represent a strong start to what promises to be a significant year for the company. In particular, the resilience and strength of our core services Divisions and the full participation in the fast-growing North America market have contributed to a very solid year-on-year growth and margins expansion. Secondly, the activity outlook is shaping up favorably as 2022 progresses and is set to support our full-year mid-teens growth ambition, despite the uncertainties in our Russia operations. Furthermore, in the later part of the year, we will gain from improving market conditions, favorable activity mix in key offshore basins and the Middle East, and broader net pricing impact across North America and international markets. Our confidence in the favorable market conditions and our mid-term outlook supports our margin expansion ambition and our commitment to generate double-digit free cash flow. As a result, we have decided to accelerate cash returns to shareholders through a visible increase in our dividend. Finally, we believe that the consequences of the current crisis will reinforce the market fundamentals for a stronger and longer upcycle, as the priority on energy security will favor reinvestment in oil and gas supply. Consequently, the outlook for the next few years is improving and, absent a global economic setback, should translate into an exceptional sequence for the industry. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Stephane Biguet",
            "content": "Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. First-quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.34. This represents a decrease of $0.07 sequentially and an increase of $0.13 when compared to the first quarter of last year. In addition, during the quarter, we recorded a $0.02 gain relating to the further sale of a portion of our shares in Liberty Oilfield Services, which brought our GAAP EPS to $0.36. Overall, our first-quarter revenue of $6 billion decreased 4% sequentially, while pretax operating margins declined 84 basis points to 15%. These decreases reflect the seasonally lower activity and product sales that we typically experience in the first quarter. The conflict in Ukraine also had an impact on our first-quarter results, although this was largely limited to the effects of the depreciation of the ruble witnessed during the last month of the quarter. While margins were seasonally lower on a sequential basis, they did increase significantly as compared to the first quarter of last year. Pretax segment operating margin increased 229 basis points year-on-year, while company-wide adjusted EBITDA margins of 21% increased 94 basis points year-on-year, despite the inflationary factors we are facing. This reflects the strength of our operating leverage, new technology uptake, and increasing pricing traction. Let me now go through the first-quarter results for each Division. First-quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $857 million decreased 4% sequentially with margins declining 372 basis points to 34%. These decreases were primarily due to the effects of seasonally lower digital and exploration data licensing sales, partially offset by improved contribution from our APS projects in Ecuador, following the pipeline disruption of last quarter. Reservoir Performance revenue of $1.2 billion decreased 6% sequentially while margins declined 232 basis points to 13.2%. These decreases were due to lower activity in Latin America and the seasonal activity reduction in the Northern Hemisphere. Well Construction revenue of $2.4 billion was essentially flat sequentially as seasonal reductions in Europe, Russia, and Asia were offset by strong drilling activity in North America, Latin America, and the Middle East. Margins of 16.2% increased 77 basis points sequentially, despite the flat revenue largely due to improved profitability in integrated drilling projects. Finally, Production Systems revenue of $1.6 billion decreased 9% sequentially and margins decreased 192 basis points to 7.1%. This was due to the effect of lower revenue following the traditionally higher fourth-quarter product sales combined with delayed deliveries and increased logistics costs resulting from global supply chain constraints. These are temporary challenges that we are diligently working to remedy. Once resolved, this will provide for favorable upside to our revenue and margins in future quarters, as our backlog is solid, and we will ultimately return to a normal pace of deliveries. Now, turning to our liquidity. During the quarter, we generated $131 million of cash flow from operations and negative free cash flow of $381 million. Our cash flow generation was seasonally low as a result of the increase in working capital requirements we always experience in the first quarter. In addition to the typical payout of our annual employee incentives in the first quarter, we saw lower cash collections following the exceptional accounts receivable performance of the fourth quarter. Our inventory balance also grew due to the product delivery delays in our Production Systems Division, but also to prepare for project start-ups in the second quarter and for the strong growth anticipated for the rest of the year. In addition, we took the decision to increase our safety stocks and lock in prices on certain long-lead items in order to secure supply and hedge against anticipated cost inflation. Although, it is reflected outside of free cash flow, our overall cash position was enhanced by the further sale of a portion of our shares in Liberty, which generated $84 million of net proceeds. Following this transaction, we hold a 27% interest in Liberty. Our working capital and cash flow will improve each quarter for the rest of the year, consistent with our historical trends and we remain confident in our ability to generate double-digit free cash flow margin on a full-year basis. This will allow us to continue deleveraging the balance sheet and exceed our previously stated leverage target in 2022. Based on this and the strengthening industry outlook that Olivier described earlier, we announced today a 40% increase in our quarterly dividend. The increase will be reflected in our July dividend and will result in approximately $140 million of additional dividend payments in 2022 and $280 million on an annualized basis. This will have a minimal impact on our leverage and we will, of course, remain focused on strengthening the balance sheet. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier. Look, it's good question. Thank you. Yes, based on the market fundamentals, we highlighted, we do expect to continue generating significant free cash flow throughout the cycle. If those favorable conditions persist, as we currently anticipate, this will clearly allow us to, at the same time, maintain the strong balance sheet to fund new growth opportunities, and look for additional ways to increase shareholder returns throughout the cycle. So, this can take the form of increased dividends, share repurchases, or a combination of both. So, as it relates to a framework, we will, of course, provide further details at our upcoming Capital Market Day. At this moment, we set the dividend that level we are comfortable with to allowing us to balance our continuing deleveraging commitments with the overall capital allocation priorities. So on the logistical side, Neil, the Capital Market Day will be early November and you'll receive the invitations pretty soon. I'll let Olivier comment on the main agenda."

            "name": "Olivier Le Peuch",
            "content": "Thank you, ND. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on the call today. In my remarks, I will cover our first-quarter results and achievements followed by our latest view of the market environment and our outlook for the second quarter and the rest of the year, particularly internationally. Stephane will then give more detail on our financial results, and we will open the floor for your questions. Considering the global context during the first quarter, I am very pleased with our start of the year. Sequentially, the quarter broadly reflected typical seasonal patterns, except for additional effects of the Russian ruble devaluation and a more pronounced sequential decline in Production Systems. Year-on-year, we delivered a strong increase in earnings and revenue growth along with operating margins expansion. Our results were particularly strong in Well Construction and Reservoir Performance, where we are maximizing our leading market positions, our top-tier technology, performance, and enhanced operating leverage to full effect, both internationally and in North America. All Divisions and Areas grew year-on-year, resulting in 14% overall growth. This was achieved through double-digit revenue growth internationally, and by fully capitalizing on our North America exposure with 32% revenue growth. Operating margins expanded in both North America and in the international markets, and we start the year with the highest first-quarter margins since 2015. This establishes an excellent foundation for our full-year margin expansion ambition. Well Construction and Reservoir Performance, our core services Divisions, had very strong momentum to start the year. In addition, we secured several new multiyear contracts and improving commercial conditions in a number of geographies and services. Digital & Integration also posted double-digit growth compared to the same period last year, with new critical commercial contracts, and significant advance of our digital platform strategy with the launch of our first INNOVATION FACTORI in North America. In Production Systems, our core equipment Division, year-on-year growth was muted by the impact of supply chain bottlenecks, which have pushed deliveries into subsequent quarters. Despite these transitory challenges, I am very pleased with the quality and size of the backlog and orders secured in the past 12 months. With improving supply conditions, I am confident that the execution of our response plan will significantly improve backlog conversion, resulting in an accelerated revenue growth dynamic in the coming quarters. In Russia, the onset of the tragic conflict in Ukraine and corresponding sanctions impacted the later part of the quarter. We swiftly initiated a series of actions to ensure the safety of our people and implemented restrictive measures concerning new investment and technology deployment to our Russia operations. We continue to closely monitor this dynamic situation and remain hopeful for the quick cessation of hostilities. Overall, and despite unique challenges, I am very pleased with the results of the quarter. I would like to extend my thanks to the entire Schlumberger team for successfully navigating these developments and delivering an excellent start to what promises to be a year of solid growth and achievement. Turning now to the macro environment, the energy landscape has evolved significantly over the past few months. Recent events have, on one hand, resulted in a change in the pace of demand recovery, while energy security and supply diversification have also emerged as preeminent global drivers that will shape the future of our industry, in addition to decarbonization, capital discipline, and digital transformation. This new dimension will have long-lasting positive implications for energy investment over the next few years. I would like to share how we see these dynamics developing over the short- and long-term horizons, and more importantly, how these conditions will play to Schlumberger's differentiated strengths. First, in the short term, commodity prices are elevated, as supply conditions continue to tighten due to the impacts of capital discipline, consistent OPEC+ policy implementation, and the potential impact of supply dislocation from Russia. The industry is responding to this high commodity price environment with accelerated short-cycle investment in North America led by the private producers and a gradual increase in investment by the public operators, albeit tempered by capital discipline and bottlenecks in capacity and supply chain. Internationally, short-cycle investments are set to accelerate with the seasonal rebound in the second quarter and more strongly in the second half of the year, led by the Middle East and the key international offshore basins. Second, the elevation of energy security as a priority will drive further capacity expansion and optionality to deliver a more diverse oil and gas supply. This will support additional long-cycle development projects, exploration activity, and brownfield rejuvenation programs. Third, favorable conditions for product and services net-pricing improvements have clearly emerged and are expanding across both North America and the international markets. This will be a defining characteristic of this upcycle, considering the service sector's newfound capital discipline and commitment to margin expansion. These improvements are absolutely critical to support returns and investment in capacity that will be needed to deliver on both the short- and long-term oil and gas supply the world needs. The combination of these effects creates an exceptional sequence for our sector, likely resulting in a cycle of higher magnitude and duration than previously anticipated. Schlumberger has led the sector in reinventing itself over the past few years, aligning closely with industry shifts, customer needs, and increased shareholder value. Since launching our performance strategy, we targeted trends that are manifesting today by focusing on the development of fit-for-basin technologies some of which are now unlocking much-needed energy supplies and by reducing or eliminating GHG emissions with our Transition Technologies portfolio and our new end-to-end emissions solutions. We have also expanded manufacturing capacity in key basins, such as in North America and in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, to tailor fit-for-basin technology delivery. In Digital, we are enabling transformation in the sector, establishing the industry digital platform, DELFI; creating more powerful AI solutions; and leading innovation in autonomy. These advances in digital enablement are improving both customer operations and our own efficiency, as we evolve workflows and improve execution with insights from data. Today, Schlumberger is best positioned to capture the benefits of this unique upcycle, given the steady execution of our strategy, breadth of our market presence, leading technology portfolio, and our ability to derive premium pricing through our performance execution and value creation for our customers. Now I would like to share with you our outlook for the second quarter and the second half of the year. Sequentially, we expect a solid quarter of growth in both North America and the international market. Growth in North America will be led by continued short cycle activity, offset by Canadian spring break-up. Internationally, growth will be driven by the seasonal rebound, albeit moderated by the absence of the usual second-quarter uptick in Russia, owing to the uncertainty around the ruble depreciation, impact of sanctions, and customer activity decline. Taken together, this will result in global revenue growth around mid-single-digits for the second quarter. We anticipate the operating margins to expand 50 to 100 basis points, driven by further operating leverage and the positive conditions I have outlined. In that context, our sequential margin expansion trajectory is set to resume and subsequently strengthen in the second half of the year in line with our full-year guidance. Looking further ahead, the second half of the year is shaping up to be particularly strong, based on our view of a significant pipeline of customer activity, upcoming product backlog conversion, and the growing impact of net pricing. This period of the year is typically the strongest half, and 2022 looks to be no exception. While the dynamic situation in Russia and the potential reduction in pace of the demand recovery present near-term concerns, we believe the continued tightness in supply, elevated commodity prices, and supplemental investment intended to diversify oil and gas supply should represent a positive offset for 2022 and beyond. Accordingly, second-half growth will be driven primarily by the international markets, led by the Middle East and key offshore basins. Indeed, the offshore activity, already growing sequentially and visibly year-on-year, will benefit from secular growth in both shallow and deepwater environments as the acceleration of infill drilling and tieback developments will combine with a resurgence of exploration drilling during the summer, and with an acceleration of long-cycle development projects ahead of 2023. Similarly, the Middle East region will benefit from the combination of reinvestment in short-cycle barrels as we approach the end of current OPEC+ agreements and from the commitment to capacity expansion in both oil production and gas developments. Additionally, 2022 is set to benefit from higher discretionary spending and higher product sales and year-end deliveries as customers secure the necessary capacity for their 2023 growth plans. Finally, and critically, we anticipate that net pricing impact will further extend in breadth and scale as the year progresses, to benefit margin expansion during the second half, and become a unique attribute of this upcycle. With this backdrop, and despite the uncertainty linked to Russia, we believe that the favorable market conditions I outlined should allow us to maintain our full-year ambitions of year-on-year revenue growth in the mid-teens, and adjusted EBITDA margins exiting the year at least 200 basis points higher than the fourth quarter of 2021. I will now turn the call over to Stephane. Thank you, Stephane. I think we can open the floor to the Q&A session. Thank you very much. Good morning, David. No. Thank you, Dave. So indeed, first, to put things in context. I think the international growth started to be rebounding last year. I think, as you know, year-on-year in the second half last year, we had already posted more than double-digit growth year-on-year in the second half. You can see that on this quarter, we're already at 10% growth year-on-year and the majority of our international geounits actually posted double-digit, and quite a few above 20% year-on-year. So clearly the momentum of activity pickup internationally has been initiated, and it's not only short cycle, it's short and long cycle as some FID have already been signed last year and more are coming in the way. So now looking ahead and trying to understand how this is hedging in the future. I think, first, there is a dynamic of call on international supply that will continue to happen as the demand recovery is happening and as the market is looking for energy security and enhanced diversification of supply. So international basins at large will benefit from this dynamic in the years to come. Secondly, you have the dynamic of short-cycle response to the tightness of supply as we face today and we will face for the quarter to come, and this will prompt not only activity of cycle in the second half of this quarter and in the subsequent quarter in all the short-cycle basins from Middle East to some short-cycle activity offshore and it will be supplemented in the second half by an acceleration of the long-cycle development. Indeed, we believe that the conditions are set for long- and short-cycle to be contributing at the same time to the supply growth of international market. And long-cycle is not only offshore, long cycle is some large capacity expansion, that national company, majors, are continuing to post. And offshore market, we'll also see the condition of major and international operator continue to expand their investment. So, we are seeing this happening today. We are seeing this accelerating in the second half visibly as the combination of short and long run benefit the international market. And the OPEC+ as you know is ending their quota distribution at the end of the third quarter and this will unlock short-cycle. If you were to look at Middle East, a few countries have already made a commitment to capacity expansion in 2022 and beyond, and this will be supplementing the short-cycle investment. Offshore, you have seen some FID approval, you have seen some exploration drilling resuming last quarter that would just turn into FID and into subsea and the deepwater activity uptick in the second half and furthermore in 2023. So, the conditions are set, as I said, for both short- and long-cycles to contribute to supply from international basins, and we are very well placed to respond to this considering favorable market exposure to international markets, our market position with NOCs, and our exposure to both major and independents into key basins internationally. No, I will comment in two sides. First, offshore markets remain very relevant to many of our customers internationally, very relevant. Why? Because the economics of offshore market both shallow and deepwater have improved a lot in the cycle. Secondly, many of these offshore reserves are very well placed from a carbon footprint and I think this is something that plays again to reinvestment and expansion. And, third, I think the technology, the integration capability, and digital have made offshore operations more efficient, more effective, have an impact on short cycle offshore infill drilling, tie back with huge technology differentiation we have there, and exploration -- in near-field exploration on one hand. And secondly shorter, long cycle. That is a characteristic that we see accelerating as the majors and IOCs and some NOC that have unique basin \u2013 advantaged basin. We want to accelerate the FID and we want to accelerate the execution of the FID for contributing supply. And, again, integration capability, technology for performance impact, and digital will all combine to make this a reality. So yes, we have already seen the impact of this, and is only set to accelerate and will not necessarily link to the event happening the last few weeks. The last few weeks event will have the consequence of diversification of supply and security of supply. And this will favor offshore basins as one of the best things that can contribute to the long-term supply security. You're welcome. Good morning, Chase. I think the conditions are set for directionally going there, clearly, and I think you have several factor playing. First, the level of activity expansion globally in every basin for every division is creating the condition for tightness in the capacity of supply, of the service supply and the equipment supply. And these conditions are extremely favorable for pricing power, because our operators, our customers, are looking to secure capacity and to secure delivery assurance as they reinvest into their basins, into their favorable assets to secure this participation to this supply market share. So, first, the pricing movements as I said or the pricing attributes will be a key characteristic of the cycle. Secondly, I believe that the industry has realized that technology can make a huge impact on performance, on carbon footprint, and on digitalization to deliver efficiency that we need to accelerate the cycle and deliver assurance of delivery of these extra barrels. So we believe that we have here the condition for an upside on the technology adoption, an upside on digital transformation of the industry trying to achieve operation automation, achieve drilling autonomy, in terms of operation, and all that will combine in addition to decarbonization. So you have these trends that are new, that will augment the mix effect that this market is giving us today. We have a favorable mix, international and the accretive offshore mix. We have a favorable pull and stretch on capacity of the industry with significant discipline on this side of the industry that will lead to pricing expansion. And finally, you have this adoption of digital, adoption of decarbonization, and adoption of any fit-for-basin performance technology that can make an impact, to deliver, because industry wants to deliver and participate fully to this cycle. So that's the reason why we are positive on this cycle. No. I think you laid the case very well, I think, digital will be an attribute of efficiency, performance, and transformation in the cycle, no doubt, everybody recognizes it and everybody's investing towards participating to this digital transformation. We believe with our platform strategy, we have certainly the most compelling offer to the market. And we have been building as you heard before, for the last 3 to 5 years, the foundation of our platform, and we have seen adoption accelerating last year. So year-to-date, I'm very pleased with the performance \u2013 the early performance of the year to our digital business out of our Digital & Integration division. It is already contributing to visible growth year-on-year. All the metrics that we are internally following be it the customer adoption of our DELFI, be it the number of users that are using our cloud-DELFI capability, or be it the number of, the scale and intensity of multicycle, of computing cycle adoption, all these are going sequentially and year-on-year, up. So, adoption is happening, you have seen some enhancements have grown during the quarter. And you continue to see adoption translating into contract and into growth, accretive growth for digital. Finally, I think, as we mentioned into the EPR, we have been announcing a year ago our INNOVATION FACTORI. INNOVATION FACTORI, our digital collaborative center that we have placed strategically and we just integrated the last one yesterday in Oslo, Norway. And we are using these places to expose our customers to the capability of our platform with AI and machine learning using our partner capability, integrating into DELFI. And the customer realized that we can achieve a lot. We have delivered 200 projects collaboratively for customers and the customer understands the power of our platform through this exposure and then come away with the ability to scale for enterprise deployment from this INNOVATION FACTORI capability. So, this is one other dimension of adoption that we see and as part of our offering to the market. So, yes, we are convinced this will be accretive to our growth this year. And this will be also having a fall-through -- a positive fall-through of our margin that will support our margin expansion ambition for the full year. Thank you. It's a very relevant question. I think it's a very topical subject with the operators, and indeed, we are seeing operators preparing, planning and being ready for accelerating their gas supply to the world market, internationally and in North America as well. I think this is touching all aspects of exploration, development, and production of gas. And we are very pleased for our exposure, our exposure in North America and exposure internationally. Internationally, as you know, we have exposure in conventional gas. And, I think, you have seen some recent announcement of renewing contracts in commercial gas in Saudi, you are fully aware of market exposure in Qatar, that we have benefited for the last 2 years that have already grown visibly to commit more LNG train for supply to the world. And you have seen also that we are going to participate fully and we are participating fully into offshore integrated gas development, similar to what we did a few years back with Zohr in East Mediterranean, we are doing with an asset for fully integrated gas in Turkey in the Black Sea, where we are taking care of everything from development to the gas facility that will be from \u2013 that will deliver our first gas from this. So, we are very well exposed. And finally, unconventional gas internationally in the Middle East, particularly, is getting significant support for regional consumption and you are fully aware of the contract, very large contract, integrated contract, we have with Jafurah in Saudi Aramco. So, the exposure we have on gas is unique, conventional, unconventional, offshore, onshore. So, and finally, if I have to add one dimension of technology onto it, I was very pleased. This week we brought the Board to participate to visit in Norway. And we had the opportunity to visit excellence, our Center of Excellence, for subsea processing in Bergen, Norway, where we are manufacturing all of our processing boosting equipment to serve gas markets in deepwater subsea environment. And in particular, the subsea wet gas compression that will be deployed for Ormen Lange to extend the life of Ormen Lange gas supply to UK for the long run. So, these participate in the energy security, these participate to the gas development and production and we are very pleased with our exposure. So we are seeing signal of acceleration commitment, and we are very well leveraging that for the future. Hey, Neil. The main agenda, as you know, I think would be to achieve 2 or 3 key elements. The first is to lay out our updated view of the mid- and long-term outlook for our industry. And, of course, the engines that we want to participate fully into, the core, the digital, and new energy, and as such document our view of the market scenario and the way our play will expose us to fully participate in each of these three. The second, obviously, will be to articulate the elements of the strategy that will make you understand the tangible progress we have made, the critical milestones we'll meet by 2025 or by 2030. And, finally, we'll document, I will say, our financial ambition, and financial and capital framework to support this ambition of our strategic execution for the next 5 years and with the long horizon of 2030 for a target. So that's what we are aiming to achieve this Capital Market Day. I think, generally speaking, I think, it is not only Saudi Aramco, or Saudi and UAE. I think it is the GCC countries, and includes Iraq as well, I think, that set are for a significant rebound in both short cycle to respond to the unlocking the quota at the end of the year and then long cycle with capacity expansion commitments that several countries have made. So, we expect the consequence of that would be, first, in the second half of the year, activity will start to see an uptick in the form of short cycle, and that will affect both Reservoir Performance and Well Construction. And we will see also this expanding into offshore and onshore capacity expansion more into 2023. As you know, several contracts have been put in place to support this capacity expansion by this operator with first and the industry at large. And this will see an acceleration of investment in 2023 that will expand beyond the short-cycle visibly into this new development, new capacity, beyond what is happening today on gas and unconventional happening today in some of the integrated contract we already own. So it's -- it will be widespread, I would say, and across the --all the divisions as we move into 2023. Thank you. No, it remains \u2013 our new energy remains a critical strategic pillar of our long-term strategy. So, we are set to continue to invest into the venture we have created. We are making tactical moves and strategic moves to accelerate organic and inorganic investment. And we continue to monitor the market and continue to hedge and grew exposure to this. So, the market condition that have slightly changed in last few weeks, do not change our view on the new energy outlook. We have been seeing some reinvestments, and you have seen this during the quarter, into geothermal as an alternate source of energy. You have seen that geoenergy being through the Celsius Energy venture that we have created was - is- a domain that was identified by EU, the European Union, to be invested in to substitute gas and hence, to lessen the dependency on single source of supply on gas. And I think you can certainly anticipate and see that CCS at large is growing as an opportunity for oil industry. And for us, as we work not only with industry as you have seen the announcement we made with PETRONAS, but also we are working beyond the industry, as you have seen previous engagement we have and continue to do so. So, I think, we continue to develop and mature the technology, ready for scaling them, and we continue to make organic investments and securing inorganic opportunity to augment our capability into that space. I think, we have been commenting on this before. And, I think, we'll provide a very comprehensive view at our Capital Markets Day. And, I think, the biggest and long-term bigger potential is both on CCS and hydrogen market, we believe, first and foremost. And believe that the energy storage including lithium processing or extraction, as well as energy, stationary energy storage, as well as geo-energy, geothermal, are certainly shorter-term and mid-term opportunity that we'll not miss to secure. But we'll come back with more detail and more, a better framework for you to understand our ambition there. Thank you. Good morning, Connor. No. First, I think the OPEC+ indeed has been very strict into implementing the policy in respect to the quota. Second, I think with very few exceptions, the GCC has been able to indeed unlock this production without significant, at this moment, significant increase in short cycle activity to support that increase. This will position into necessary investment into supporting the sustained capacity in the coming months. Until then and until now it has been that the production of some critical countries were below their sustained capacity potential, hence the need for reinvesting, the need for accelerating investment, drilling or intervention, was measured and was not necessarily disproportionate compared to the past. I think you will see that transitioning into the second half, and accelerating next year and it will combine with a capacity expansion they have committed to. So they will be a hike in activity on two fronts, the short cycle to this time sustain maximum capacity that is established and an investment that will expand this sustained capacity in the future. So that is set to happen. It wasn't necessarily a big surprise to us. I think that Middle East was a bit of behind in terms of activity rebound internationally until now, but you will see this catching up in the second half and accelerating in 2023. I think it's obviously an extremely dynamic situation. For one, the sanction is certainly having an impact on the Russian economy and our operation will not be immune to this effect. But as currently, currency fluctuation, as you have seen, our customer activity level today or tomorrow. So \u2013 and there is also possibility of further sanction, so the impact of the first quarter, as you have seen, was essentially limited to currency depreciation and dilution. It's very difficult at the moment to predict what the impact may be in an upcoming quarter considering the uncertainty. On the flip side, as I've described, the environment that we see and the dynamics we see in the market, and the anticipated response to this call for energy security is creating the condition to offset this uncertainty and offset this risk. And also, the decision we have made to suspend new investment will mean that we will be able to allocate this CapEx to this upcoming opportunity effective this year, and then being able to capture this upside in activity in this dynamic environment. And as you say, should allow us to offset and keep our financial ambition intact. Thank you. Good morning, Roger. I think there are 2 elements I think we need to-- we should really -- separate here. The first is the transitory temporary impact we have had on the excessive cost of logistics, and delivery supply chain bottleneck that we have to work through that had led to temporary costs that I think will over time abate and will reduce as we work through this supply chain. We have a corrective action plan with diversification of source of supply, using different logistics routes, and you heard about our commitment to some critical safety stock for inventory to secure less disruption going forward. So, this disruption aside, that has had consequential cost, supplementary cost impact, I think we expect this to be more subdued, as we go forward and we start to accelerate our conversion of our backlog. So what do we need? I think we have already this in the backlog. We have a very big backlog that we have accumulated for the last few quarters, that we keep growing. And it's not only subsea. Our Production Systems is made of subsea, as I mentioned, I think we are very proud of some of our market position in subsea, including what we have seen in Norway, but also have a completion with a few contracts that we won in the Middle East, in Brazil, in particular, artificial lift, PCP pumps that you have seen that we have won just in Kuwait, with very good position; Production chemicals that are being pulled as well. And our midstream and surface Cameron capability that are fully leveraging, particularly surface, the upcycling in North America. So if you combine all of these, we have not only short-cycle exposure with surface in North America of completions, artificial lift, we have long cycle with deepwater, and some of our long-cycle participation into some gas facility, as I mentioned, in Turkey. You combine all this and you have enough backlog to lift and create an uplift into our growth going forward and actually indicative of Production Systems to be accretive to our growth in the second half. I think, I will not try to compare Russia margin with the rest of our portfolio. I think, I will look at it from strength of the cycle, from the lead market position we have, and from the starting point we have today with having restructured and reset operating leverage, the exposure with digital, the exposure with an increasing offshore long- and short-cycle mix; I think these attributes that convince us that our margin will continue to expand. As we have seen this quarter, we have increased year-on-year, both NAM and international margin. And we have been posting the best margin since, then, 2015. And, yet, despite an impact in the first quarter from Russia. So I think we're looking at it, as you say, the big picture. The big picture includes investment in oil and gas for energy security, diversification that will have a call on international supply as well as in North America, and an increasing mix of short and long cycle as capacity needs to be expanded and the reserves that have been depleted through the last down-cycle for the last seven years will need to be expanded again. So that mix is what makes us confident into our trajectory of margin expansion, and into the potential uniqueness of this upcycle compared to past, and hence the confidence we have in a short- and long-term. I think, I cannot be speculating on this market condition. I think you see the same numbers as we do see. You see that there is, as I said, a potential risk of Russia supply dislocation. I think what is important is that the demand trajectory, that is recovering, and is set to further increase next year, compared to previous prediction, not only to offset that, but to also respond to the market, I think, will be contributing to overall growth, so it's very difficult to predict. I think, we are \u2013 this is a very dynamic situation. And we are not here to speculate on that dynamic situation. We know that we have to account for assumption that it could be a demand dislocation. It could be a demand, or supply disruption from the Russia source of supply. Hence we know and we have seen our customer rotating and starting to anticipate and position themselves for participating to the call on supply that will happen from the second half of this year and the years to come. So that's the only thing we can come up with. So, again, we cannot speculate on this. I think, we -- our first and foremost priority is to look after the safety of our people, everywhere we operate, including Russia, and to comply with the utmost diligence to the sanction \u2013 international sanctions that are in place. To speculate about what are the consequences of the sanction onto the OFS industry in Russia, I think, is something that the future will tell us what is happening. But, I think, I don't want to be in a position to comment on this at this moment. Thank you very much. I believe that it's time to close this call. So, in conclusion, I would like to leave you with 3 takeaways. Firstly, our first-quarter financial results represent a strong start to what promises to be a significant year for the company. In particular, the resilience and strength of our core services Divisions and the full participation in the fast-growing North America market have contributed to a very solid year-on-year growth and margins expansion. Secondly, the activity outlook is shaping up favorably as 2022 progresses and is set to support our full-year mid-teens growth ambition, despite the uncertainties in our Russia operations. Furthermore, in the later part of the year, we will gain from improving market conditions, favorable activity mix in key offshore basins and the Middle East, and broader net pricing impact across North America and international markets. Our confidence in the favorable market conditions and our mid-term outlook supports our margin expansion ambition and our commitment to generate double-digit free cash flow. As a result, we have decided to accelerate cash returns to shareholders through a visible increase in our dividend. Finally, we believe that the consequences of the current crisis will reinforce the market fundamentals for a stronger and longer upcycle, as the priority on energy security will favor reinvestment in oil and gas supply. Consequently, the outlook for the next few years is improving and, absent a global economic setback, should translate into an exceptional sequence for the industry. Thank you very much."

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Industry Affairs, James R. McDonald. Please go ahead.\nJames McDonald: Thank you, Leah. Good morning, and welcome to the SLB fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings conference call. Today's call is being hosted from Houston, following our Board meeting, held earlier this week. Joining us on the call are Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Executive Officer; and Stephane Biguet, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind all participants that some of the statements we will be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and our other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our fourth quarter press release, which is on our website. With that, I will turn the call over to Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, James. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on the call today. In my prepared remarks, I will discuss our fourth quarter and full year results, highlight a number of achievements and share our thoughts on the outlook for 2024 and our financial ambitions. Stephane will then provide more detail on our financial results and will open the line for your questions. Let's begin. The fourth quarter was an impressive conclusion to the year's financial results. We grew revenue both sequentially and year-on-year and we achieved cycle high margins and cash flows during the quarter. Our strong performance was fueled by the international and offshore markets and was supported by robust sales in digital and integration of the acquired Aker subsea business. Throughout the year, we witnessed continued growth in the international and offshore markets, where customers are focused on enhanced production and capacity additions. We have also seen further investments in digital technologies for planning and operational efficiency. This is driving growth today and presenting opportunities into the future. The international shift in investment has accelerated during the year, with fourth quarter revenue growth driven by the Middle East and Asia and Europe and Africa, where we continue to benefit from long-cycle developments, capacity expansions and exploration appraisal activities. Specific to offshore, we delivered a very strong fourth quarter as we grew our legacy portfolio and harnessed a strong performance from our OneSubsea joint venture. On this note, I would like to extend my thanks to the entire Aker subsea team who have joined us three months ago and have already contributed very well to our strong year and results. Exiting the year, our international revenue and margins reached new cycle highs, marking our tenth consecutive quarter of year-on-year double-digit revenue growth on the international front. And we delivered exceptional free cash flow of $2.3 billion in the quarter. Next, let me reflect on our accomplishments for the full year. We fulfilled our full year financial ambitions, growing revenue by 18%, surpassing our revenue growth target for the year and achieving adjusted EBITDA growth in the mid-20s. Additionally, we generated $4 billion in free cash flow, our highest since 2015. In the core, across production systems, Reservoir Performance and well construction, we grew revenue by more than 20% and expanded pre-tax operating margins by almost 300 basis points. This was driven by strong activity internationally and offshore, new technology deployment and strong product sales. Notably, we achieved our highest ever revenue in the Middle East, led by impressive growth in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and the East Mediterranean. Offshore also contributed positive momentum, led by remarkable growth in Brazil and Angola and very solid increases in the U.S., Gulf of Mexico, Guyana and Norway. This was supported by the contribution from the acquired Aker subsea business, which enabled us to expand in certain markets, mainly in Norway and Australia. Additionally, our fit-for-basin business model continued to deliver differentiated value in North America, resulting in revenue growth outperforming to the record. In digital, we continue to witness the adoption of our digital workflows and data AI platform as customers work to enhance efficiency and returns by integrating our connected and autonomous trading data and AI solutions. We now have more than 6,000 Delfi users and have generated 125 million compute hours, both representing more than 40% growth year-on-year. As a result, we achieved full year digital revenue of more than $2 billion with our new technology platforms comprised of cloud, edge and AI, growing at a CAGR of 60% since 2021. In new energy, we forged new partnerships and made new investments in capture technology for carbon capture and storage. We are seeing very positive momentum in this space. And we are actively participating in more than $400 million of CCS tenders globally. Additionally, in short-term and energy, we are partnering with government agencies in the Middle East on lower carbon electricity and in Europe on zero carbon heating and cooling solutions. As we advance our three engines of growth, we also continue to deliver for our customers and stakeholders, by achieving our lowest-recordable injury rate and highest level of operational reliability on record. This is also reflected in industry surveys, where we are growing customer satisfaction through performance and value creation. Finally, we reduced our emission intensity across Scope 1, 2, and 3 on the path to achieving our 2025 emissions reductions commitment. Moving forward, we are well-positioned to capture further growth, and I look forward to building on this strong success in the year ahead. I want to thank the entire SLB team for delivering these impressive results. Turning to the macro. The characteristics of breadth, resilience and durability that have defined this cycle remain fully in place. This continues to be supported by the imperative of energy security to meet rising global demand, confirming our belief in the longevity of the cycle. After a year of demand growth in 2023, we anticipate further growth in 2024 that will continue to support the ongoing multiyear investment cycle. In international markets, growth momentum is set to continue with more than two-thirds of total investment taking place in the Middle East, offshore and gas resource plays. In the Middle East, growth will be led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which continue to commit significant investments to increase production capacity in both oil and on commercial gas, followed by Iraq and Kuwait. Meanwhile, in Asia, countries such as China, Malaysia, Indonesia and India are leading new gas exploration and development. Across our international basins, we anticipate strong activity led by Brazil and followed by West Africa and Australia. Looking across this wide baseload of activity, a significant portion is taking place offshore, while capital expenditure will continue their growth momentum in 2024. As a result, the rig count will continue to rise, mainly in the Middle East and Asia, responding to a strong FID pipeline in both shallow and deepwater. All in all, we see the potential for more than $100 billion in global offshore FIDs in both 2024 and 2025, underscoring the enduring strength of the offshore markets and supporting a very favorable subsea outlook for years to come. In this context, although geopolitical tensions persist in several regions, we do not expect any significant impact to activity in 2024, absent further escalation. Additionally, although we have witnessed short-term commodity price fluctuate over the past few months, long-cycle investment in the Middle East, offshore and gas markets remain decoupled from short-term pricing, which will continue to support the resilience of these markets. In North America, following a noticeable moderation of activity in the later part of 2023, we anticipate capital discipline to continue. Consequently, investment levels will be sustained at 2023 exit rates with minimum -- minimal increase in activity as the vision focused on sustaining record ARPU from last year. This will drive further adoption of technology as operators aim to further improve efficiency and recovery rates. Now let me explain how we expect these factors to drive our performance in 2024. In the international markets, we expect full year revenue growth reaching the mid-teens, led by the Middle East and Asia and Europe and Africa. This growth will take place both onshore and offshore, with offshore benefiting from our newly formed OneSubsea joint venture, which enters the year with close to $4.5 billion of subsea production system backlog. We expect to deliver more than $4 billion in additional subsea bookings in 2024, open increase of more than 25% year-on-year as the market continues to expect. For clarity, when excluding the impact of Aker contribution and the expected decline in Russia, we expect double-digit international growth for the year. Meanwhile, in North America, although activity has moderated, we expect full year revenue growth reaching the mid-single digits, driven by our technology and leverage portfolio in both U.S. land and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Turning to the divisions. We expect all core divisions to grow led by Production Systems and Reservoir Performance. Digital integration is also expected to grow with digital growing in the high teens, primarily driven by new technology platforms, while APS remains flat. Directionally, we expect further margin expansions, driven by tight service capacity internationally, pricing and increased technology adoption. This will result in year-on-year EBITDA growth in the mid-teens. With continued growth in earnings, our profitability to generate cash and confidence in the long-term outlook, we are pleased to announce that the Board of Directors have approved a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend. And we'll also increase our share repurchase program in 2024. Combined, we are targeting a return to return more than $2.5 billion to shareholders in 2024, an increase of more than 25% compared to 2023. Looking to the first quarter. We anticipate the typical pattern of activity beginning with the combined effects of seasonality and the absence of year-end digital sales. As a result, on a year-on-year basis, we expect first quarter revenue growth in the low-teens and EBITDA growth in the mid-teens. This will be followed by an activity rebound in the second quarter and further acceleration of growth in the second half of the year, particularly in the international markets. This will support the ambition we have set for the full year revenue and earnings growth. I will now turn the call over to Stephane.\nStephane Biguet : Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Fourth quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits was $0.86. This represents an increase of $0.08 sequentially and an increase of $0.15 when compared to the same period of last year. We recorded $0.09 of charges during the fourth quarter of this year, $0.06 related to the devaluation of the peso in Argentina and the remaining $0.03 related to merger and integration costs associated with our acquisition of the Aker subsea business, which closed at the beginning of the quarter. We anticipate that we will incur additional charges as integration activities continue over the course of 2024. Our full year 2023 revenue of $33.1 million grew 18% year-on-year. While this revenue is roughly the same as the pre-pandemic level of 2019, our adjusted EBITDA in 2023 in absolute dollars was 22% higher. As a result, our full-year 2023 EBITDA margin of 24.5% has expanded 430 basis points over this period on a similar revenue base. This highlights the high grading of our portfolio over the last few years, our significantly improved operating leverage and our favorable market position, particularly internationally and offshore. Fourth quarter revenue of $8.99 billion increased 8% sequentially, with the acquired of Aker subsea business accounting for approximately 70% of the increase. Fourth quarter pretax operating margin of 20.8% improved 52 basis points sequentially and 101 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter of 25.3% was 95 basis points higher than the same period of last year. I will now go through the fourth quarter results for each division. Fourth quarter digital and integration revenue of $1 billion increased 7% sequentially, with pretax operating margin expanding 197 basis points to 34%. This growth was due to increased digital revenue across all areas, led by the Middle East and Asia and Europe and Africa. Reservoir Performance revenue of $1.7 million grew 3% sequentially, primarily due to increased activity internationally, mainly in the Middle East and Africa. Pretax operating margin increased 88 basis points to 21.4%, representing the highest level of this cycle, driven by higher activity and improved pricing. While construction revenue of $3.4 billion was essentially flat sequentially as international growth of 2% was offset by a decline in North America revenue resulting from lower U.S. land rig count. Pretax operating margin increased 35 basis points sequentially. Lastly, Production Systems revenue of $2.9 billion increased 24% sequentially, largely due to the acquired Aker subsea business. Excluding this effect, revenue grew 4% sequentially due to strong international sales. Pretax operating margin expanded 153 basis points to 15%, its highest-level this cycle on higher sales of midstream, artificial lift and subsea production systems. Looking ahead to the full year of 2024. We expect continued margin expansion in our core, driven by sustained operating leverage, a favorable geographic mix and pricing tailwinds. In our Digital and Integration division, we expect margins to remain approximately at the same level as 2023 as digital margins will increase due to the accelerated adoption of our new technology platforms, while APS margins will decrease as a result of higher amortization expenses. All in all, as mentioned by Olivier, strong year-on-year revenue growth and continued margin expansion will result in adjusted EBITDA growth in the mid-teens in 2024 when compared to 2023. Now turning to our liquidity. We generated $3 billion of cash flow from operations and $2.3 billion of free cash flow during the fourth quarter. This exceptional performance resulted in full year free cash flow of $4 billion, which is the highest level we have achieved since 2015. This was due to a combination of very strong year-end receivable cash collections, increased customer advances, improved inventory turns and the receipt of the prior year tax returns. As a result of this exceptional free cash flow performance, we reduced our net debt by $1.4 billion during the quarter to $8 billion. This represents our lowest net debt level since the first quarter of 2016. Capital investments, including CapEx and investments in APS projects and exploration data were $742 million in the fourth quarter and $2.6 billion for the full year. Looking ahead, we will continue to be disciplined as it relates to our capital investments. Despite the continued revenue growth, our 2024 capital investments will remain at approximately the same level as in 2023. Finally, during the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.8 million shares of our stock for a total purchase price of $100 million. For the full year, we returned a total of $2 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. Our continued capital discipline, combined with the confidence we have that 2024 will be another year of strong cash flow generation, which enable us to increase our returns to shareholders in 2024. In this regard, when combining the increased quarterly dividend that we announced today, with increased share repurchases, we are targeting to return more than $2.5 billion to our shareholders in 2024. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch : Thank you, Stephane. Ladies and gentlemen, I think we will start the Q&A. So Leah, back to you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And first, we go to the line of James West with Evercore ISI.\nJames West: So Olivier, curious to hear your thoughts. Clearly, you're looking for another year of pretty strong growth in EBITDA and revenue. But it seems to me like we've got a lot of particularly deepwater rigs that are going to start turning to the right here very soon and particularly in the second half, and it's -- there should be an exit rate that's even higher than that type of growth as we go into '25. I think, is that a fair assumption, or am I getting ahead of my skews here in terms of kind of what the overall market opportunity is going to be as we step through this year and get into the '25, '26 period?\nOlivier Le Peuch: No, that's correct. I think, James, thank you for laying out, I think, the theme of offshore, I think offshore is a distinct attribute of this cycle as really already delivered in terms of total activity visible beyond 2019 and includes both shallow and deepwater that have both grown visibly in the last 24 months. Shallow mainly driven by addition of rigs that we continue to see coming in the Middle East and Asia region and deepwater across all the deepwater basins. And we anticipate, albeit at a more moderate rate for deepwater and shallow, the rig activity to continue to increase and the exit rate of '24 to be above in terms of rig count, offshore rig count, total offshore rig count, the total exit range of \u201923. As a benefit, I think both the offshore activity and deepwater, where we have the benefit of the scale with our subsea venture will benefit. Hence, we continue to see growth, not only in '24, but running out to '25 and beyond. As I said, the total FID offshore keeps paying $100 million for each of '24 and '25, and this is not only supporting activity next year and '25, but support longevity of offshore investment beyond. So we are -- we remain very constructive on that environment. And yes, we see the exit rate to be above the last December in 12 months from now.\nJames West: Okay. Perfect. That's great to hear. And then maybe a quick follow-up in terms of CapEx. I don't know if, Stephane, if you want to take this one, but CapEx seems to be -- it seems like you're going to keep it at the same type of level that it's been, that wasn't in '23, but there's going to be a lot of -- a lot more activity. And so does that number eventually need to move higher? And when it does -- if it does, do you still believe that you can maintain this 5% to 6% of revenue for CapEx dollars ratio.\nStephane Biguet : So look James, yes, we are still growing going into '24 and beyond. But this level of CapEx we spent in '23, we think remains adequate for this year as well because you have to think about the mix of activities as well amongst all divisions. So we think we can very well address the upcoming growth within this envelope without having to increase normally throughout the year, unless growth is much more than expected. But we were comfortable with this, and we will remain indeed within our guidance, and it's actually the low end of our guidance on the CapEx side.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Anderson with Barclays.\nDavid Anderson : So maybe I can start off with the Middle East here. So another double-digit sequential quarter on EMEA, clearly, an enormous runway of activity in front of you the next several years between unconventional gas and the number of capacity expansion projects underway. My question is how you see top-line versus margins evolving? Can you maintain this pace of growth in the region in '24, or are we getting close to capacity in terms of the number of rigs available, service equipment, the E&C capacity here is pretty tight over there? And I guess, conversely, should we start seeing margins expand further as contracts reprice due to tightness in some. I noted that the tendering of Safaniyah was delayed by nine months. I'm wondering maybe there's some sticker shock from pricing. So perhaps is already underway, but just a little bit more details in terms of capacity and pricing in the Middle East, please?\nOlivier Le Peuch : Yes. Thank you, Dave. I think we have been very pleased with the activity and the way we have been able to turn this activity growth in the last 18 months and the last 12 months, particularly into revenue, benefiting from our strength on the ground in the Middle East. I think I would characterize beyond the capacity expansion and on commercial gas, which is a dual benefit for activity. I will also characterize the activity in the Middle East to be very broad. It's not two country leading this, it's almost every country in the region that we see further activity and will derive from its further revenue growth. So we are not at capacity. We don't see an inflection down of our revenue growth potential in the region, benefiting from our technology market position with every national company in the region and capability for integration to harness the part of our technology into performance for our customers, hence delivering higher revenue from rate of activity. So we are confident. When it comes to our capacity, yes, equipment capacity and everybody has been disciplined in the region. And hence, we have been responding and benefiting from pricing in the last 18 months. And as a consequence, our margins have expanded in the region and have supported what you have seen as our international margin expansion year-on-year have been a driver for margin expansion internationally. We expect this to continue as we execute 2024. But again, it's a long duration cycle, both by the nature of the investment decoupled from short-term pricing on commodities. So we remain very confident about our market position first and the market outlook and our ability to differentiate through performance, integration, technology and then continue this success in '24 and '25 and again, well into the second half of the decade.\nDavid Anderson : Yes. A long way from the peak. That's pretty clear, at least that part of the region. I was wondering if we could shift over on the digital side. I know there are a number of comments in the release today regarding increasing digital adoption by your customers. I was hoping you could expand on that a little bit. Is that simply about customers using Delfi more or as they get more comfortable with it, is there a certain application gaining traction? Is there any metrics you can give us in terms of year-over-year usage from your bigger customers? And I'm also just kind of curious, in order to grow digital revenue by essentially 50% over the next two years, is this primarily coming from an increased digital adoption of existing customers? Or do you also need new customers to get to that target?\nOlivier Le Peuch : Okay. Let me come back first on some metrics that I think we have highlighted into my opening remarks. And I think this relates to the adoption of Delfi indeed, adoption of a number of users, use of cloud compute on our Delfi platform and use of additional hedge or AI capability that we offer to customers. The combination of which, as I said, has grown 60% in the last two years on a CAGR rate and the adoption metrics that we shared, both the number of users and the number of hours of complete power that we serve to our customers on the cloud have been growing by 40%. So yes, the adoption is going, both measured by, as I always said, one customer at a the time that transition from our legacy desktop offering to our cloud. And by expansion of our workflows, data, AI capability that we offer to existing or new customers. So it's a combination of a transition of the existing customers to the cloud and adoption of data and AI capability because we are offering our platform that the industry is recognizing adopting. And finally, and maybe one of the most exciting parts that adds a dimension of growth is the digital operation, both drilling and production digital operation. You have seen some of the announcements that have been highlighted in recent weeks and months. And last week, further alignment with a partner to accelerate doing automation and autonomous systems. So the drilling adoption on the operation production with our partner, Cognite. And this is supplementing, I would say, the core growth of transitioning our real sound customers from desktop to the cloud. So you have three dimensions. You have the cloud transition with existing customers and adoption of new customers coming to SaaS solution. You have the data and AI. It\u2019s a new market. It\u2019s a reverse of the data management that scale into the cloud and AI, unlocking the power of data through AI in our industry; and finally, digital operation. These three trends are supporting our growth ambition, both this year and next year. And this span all the customer segment across the globe, and you keep seeing some announcement of customer adoption on our solutions.\nOperator: Next, we go to Scott Gruber with Citigroup.\nScott Andrew : I want to touch on transition technologies, you noted over $1 billion in sales. And I realize a lot of these are new and focus on emissions reduction. And I believe that the bucket there is separate from new energy, correct me if I'm not accurate. Olivier, I wanted to ask about the outlook for these technologies and the growth of sales of these technologies as the uptake by customers around the world seems pretty strong. Can you speak to the multiyear outlook? And is the cadence of growth for transition technologies additive to the growth rate from the core?\nOlivier Le Peuch : No, I think you are correct first in stating that this is the distinct from our focus on the five themes that we have in new energy. And this thing from the CCS, I mentioned where we have a lot of success in geothermal. And it represents a portfolio of technology that we have, that we are developing, that we are promoting to our customers that have a distinct lower emission carbon intensity compared to existing or legacy technology and have net effect on our customer for their Scope 1 or their Scope 3 upstream as we call it, emissions, but also have the characteristic to bring efficiency. So customer is looking for low-cost, low-carbon outlook and continue to adopt this technology by contrast with alternate technology that exists in the market as they deliver not only lower carbon, but also deliver higher efficiency, which are the way we characterize this technology. So yes, we are very pleased adoption. Some technology are very unique like almost zero-carbon cement solution. Some solutions are really game-changing such as some of our both processing subsea processing solution that having a net impact on the carbon footprint of subsea operation. Some technology are disrupting for the future, such as electrical full subsea and electrical full completion technology. And hence, we are seeing accelerated adoption of this. And finally, we say that we are also seeing following the COP 28 much more interest into our methane emission management solution, and you have had the announcement we made with Eni, supporting them as a global company to make an assessment and be assessing their emission intensity from methane and proposing abatement solutions. So this is a mix of technician will continue to be going in our technology mix and that supports our ambition for sustainable future and a balanced planet, but also aligned with our customers on lower carbon, lower-cost future.\nScott Gruber : Right. Got it. Appreciate that color. And then Stephane, one for you. I appreciate the cash return target for '24. Can you also provide some broader color on the cash conversion rate? The working capital release in 4Q was very impressive. So curious thinking about the working capital outlook for '24 tax rate, et cetera.\nStephane Biguet : Scott, yes, we were also very pleased with the fourth quarter and full year free cash flow and indeed in the fourth quarter, it's coming almost entirely from the working capital. So now we do expect, as I say, 2024, to be another very strong year of free cash flow, and it will show the same quarterly pattern we usually see. So in the first quarter, the working capital will clearly increase. We have the payment of annual incentives to employees as you may know. And then we'll have the reversal of certain exceptional items that occurred in the last quarter of 2023. So we'll see the effect in Q1 as usual, but then this will be followed by a gradual improvement in subsequent quarters, in line with what we observed this year. So hopefully, we can have another very strong finish of the year in 12 months from now. And deliver a strong performance as well.\nOperator: Next, we go to Luke Lemoine with Piper Sandler.\nLuke Lemoine: Olivier, you noted the booking and backlog at OneSubsea. In last call, you talked about some of the commercial and operational objectives. And I wanted to see if you could just talk about how customer engagement and dialogue has progressed with the enhanced offering you now have?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Luke. I think, let me please first with the first quarter of the subsea joint venture we have with Aker and Subsea7. I think the results speak for themselves. I think it was a direct contributor to the PS, the pollution system, performance in the fourth quarter, both on the top line and the margins. So we are very pleased. And I think as I said, I could not be more pleased than this. Now going forward, I think our objective continues to be to extract more value to synergy and to fully seize this deepwater offshore cycle that is in full fledge happening and where we see, as I said earlier, a strong outlook. So our priority is still benefit from integration capability, and as you have seen that we have announced some alliance and one of them with BP, where I think customers are approaching us organizing that subsea integration capability across the SPS and SURF are augmented by our ability to deliver and understand the reservoir as well as deliver well construction. So hence, opportunity to have integrated asset development, integrated tieback delivery and more opportunity in the space that is a full intake subsea and beyond to extract better economics and to extract more importantly -- equally importantly, a higher recovery combining our reservoir subsurface domain expertise are well placement and our subsea boosting and processing capability, all combined to extract and create a little bit of more value for subsea market going forward from economics and from production recovery. So that's where we see trends coming. And we have a portfolio that is unique with the portfolio partially on the boosting and processing and tieback capability that is unmatched in the market. And we have digital reservoir technology and our core portfolio that complements this and help and will support this alliance integration capability. So I can only be pleased with the prospects ahead of us and the feedback from our customers so far is very positive on our capability.\nOperator: Our next question is from Saurabh Pant with Bank of America.\nSaurabh Pant : Olivier, maybe I want to touch on exploration a little bit. You talked about that on the call today. You highlighted Asia. I think you talked about China, Malaysia, India, some of the other countries exploring for gas. I know you've talked about the exploration in the past. So, we are seeing at least a little bit of a tangible recovery happening on the exploration side. Maybe you can expand on that a little bit. What do you expect over the next couple of years on both the gas and the oil side. And just maybe remind us how impactful that is for SLB?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yes, thank you. I think, yes, we have commented before that we have seen resurgence and rebound of exploration activity solution appraisal in the last two or three years. This cycle has added exploration activity back to the cycle. And I think it has been driven by the desire to find new gas reserves to respond to the gas supply security concerns. And also, it has benefited from the continued exploration of oil around the existing offshore hubs in the form of infrastructure-led exploration. And also, in New Frontier replicating the success that Exxon had in Guyana and over basins. So when you look at it from where it is happening, what is unique in this cycle, it's happening everywhere. We have exploration activity, mostly offshore, that's where I think the actual success of new reserves have been mostly and in all offshore basins, both shallow and deepwater, infrastructure-led exploration in existing mature or deepwater markets and in New Frontier. So you have seen New Frontier happening in Namibia. You have New Frontier in Suriname and upcoming Brazil control margin. You have exploration in East -- West Colombia side. You have a furthermore in West Africa South. And you have what is maybe a little bit new this cycle, more exposure coming back in Asia from India, as I said, to Malaysia, China. And I think this is what constitutes a little bit of the unique cycle is broad. And it is here in our opinion to stay because the economics of offshore have improved significantly over the last couple of cycles and attribute of reserves, both gas and oil with low carbon intensity and the ability to deliver a long plateau of production is unique. So access to offshore acreage, better economics, better quality of potential geological reserves have all driven this, and we have increased the success. And we have exposure in reservoir performance with reservoir performance evaluation segments that are benefiting from it and has introduced technology that are really in high demand like Ora. And we have a lot of exposure, obviously, as well in the digital segment with our seismic data capability processing and our digital geoscience offering that both benefit from this as a consumption. So we are pleased with the market position we have, and we believe that this exposure appraisal is here to stay because it's very broad, diverse and across many basins partly in offshore.\nSaurabh Pant: Fantastic. Okay. I have one very quick follow-up, if I may, on the Middle East side. I know you talked about that on the prepared remarks and the Q&A early on. But just to go back to that, I think one thing you noted in the press release was that you expect the record Middle East growth to continue beyond 2025. If you can elaborate a little bit, Olivier, on what gives you the confidence, the line of sight beyond 2025? Maybe part of that is just the gas side of things, not just oil, right, but elaborate a little bit on the light of sight you have beyond 2025 on the Middle East.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yes. I think first, you have to realize that the capacity expansion program announced by the multiple country that have met their commitments extend from 27 to 30 plus, 30, 35 or 40 from the last country that have expanded this. And hence, I think the capacity will be -- continue to be seeing addition both land and offshore to respond to that capacity expansion. Gas, I think, is here for the long in the Middle East for 2 reasons. First, there are gas reserves that are really at a very good economic point, partially in Qatar, and we continue to present an LNG feed to the global gas market, but also unconventional reserves are seeing a significant investment, and we expect this to actually grow fast in the coming years in two or three countries that are focused on commercial gas. So the combination of this is giving us the confidence that the record ever investment that we have seen last year in Middle East will continue in \u201824, \u201825 and has potential to expand well into the second half of the decade.\nOperator: And our next question is from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta : A couple of questions for me. The first is on EBITDA margins. Congrats on crossing that 25% EBITDA margin mark. How should we think about the margin path in 2024? And as you think about the upside and downside factors that could drive you on that metric, how should we think about that?\nStephane Biguet : Clearly, we see upside in '24 and continued margin expansion as we expressed earlier, really, the -- I'm sure you will calculate, but our guidance of mid-teens EBITDA growth in absolute dollars will be achieved with revenue growth, but clearly with margin expansion across our core and in digital, as I mentioned. So yes, we continue to see margin expansion. We have great operating leverage. We have pricing tailwinds in our in our backlog and new technology adoption, and this is pushing margins together with the favorable mix, as you well know, offshore is helping margins as well. So, it's subside -- it's continue to subside from now on.\nNeil Mehta : Okay. It does sound like geo mix, operating leverage pricing, a lot of different factors there. That's helpful. And then in terms of North America, I recognize it's a smaller business for you, but you indicated in the comments you expect North America to grow in 2024 despite weaker rig count and activity. Can you talk about what's driving that and how you're able to outperform in the face of a tougher North America macro? And where are you seeing the technology adoption from a customer perspective?\nOlivier Le Peuch: No, we're very pleased with our performance in North America in retrospect in 2023 as we visibly outperformed the rig count, and we were able to grow in sequentially visibly. And we expect indeed to continue to outperform the market, and it comes from multiple factors, the mix factor of exposure we have with great exposure in Gulf of Mexico as well as East Canada and Alaska, we will see a potential of technology adoption and giving us the benefits of our mix. But also in the U.S. land market, I think we had a transition to a fit-for-basin and technology leverage focused portfolio in U.S. land and to some extent, in Canada. And we have seen this as a success with adoption of some really unique drilling technology in particular digital CCS giving us the tailwind to outperform the market in 2023, and we see this continuing. Now the priority for customers remain clearly efficiency and recovery in U.S. land market and hence, more efficiency on the trading well construction side, more recovery, use of digital, use of ESPs and also low carbon when it matters. We'll continue to make the impact and serve us very well. And the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and offshore market performance through integration performance to execution and reliability of our execution, I think, will continue to be paramount for our customers. And as long as we continue to deliver at this level, we'll get rewarded with market position and contract and pricing. And hence, we'll be able to outperform the recount, hence our guidance up to reaching the mid-single digit in 2024 against the market outlook.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.\nArun Jayaram: I wanted to get your thoughts on what you're seeing in the international markets in terms -- perhaps you could compare and contrast the spending behavior you're seeing from the NOCs versus the IOCs?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Arun. I think if I were to characterize at the highest level, I think that we have seen significant traction in the last two years and rebound of investment internationally by the international company with a delay coming from the contractual nature and also from the investment execution decision for a national company. We anticipate national company to actually grow faster in -- as we turn into 2024 led in particular by the Middle East region with leading NOCs clearly going. But I think the momentum we have gained, which was leading the pack to some extent in IOC in 2023. We expect due to the nature of our mix offshore exposure still a very solid exploration appraisal for a few of them will continue to give us momentum in the IOCs internationally. And I will not forget about the international independents that have a market position, partly in some offshore markets, and they are continuing to execute on their plan. And so we are pleased, and I think we are looking forward to the national company accelerating their relatively speaking, their growth in 2024 compared to the IOCs.\nArun Jayaram : Great. And my follow-up, Olivier, at the Analyst Day in 2022, you highlighted a target of $3 billion in new energy revenue by the end of the decade. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of where you're at in terms of that path to journey and maybe some of the areas where you're seeing the most traction today?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think as you remember and just resetting the scene for everyone, I think we had identified five domains in which we believe we have adjacency. We have potential, and we have a technology portfolio, we believe, to bring to market and disrupt and participate in new energy at scale. CCS showed you geothermal, geo-energy, energy storage, critical mineral. And hydrogen that are both -- that all of them have different horizons of growth and different scale potential for us. So, we have been, for the last two or three years, seeding investments, developing organically and inorganically technology position. We are very pleased with the momentum in CCS and geothermal going ahead of our expectation in terms of -- for CCS sequestration studies and participation to exploration in this market. And geothermal by its growth potential going beyond the established basins. So we believe that our $3 billion target would be a combination of organic growth on this adjacent market and inorganic development into the non-adjacent market. And we believe that CCS is likely to be leading in terms of potential contributor to this ambition, followed by likely hydrogen starting to be in a position that will more impact later part of the cycle in the next decade. So, we feel confident by the early investment we are making. I will feel confident about the development of the market, the support of the incentive across many regions and the early stage of success in CCS particularly as we execute this.\nOperator: We have time for one more question. That is from Roger Read with Wells Fargo.\nRoger Read : Congratulations on the quarter. Olivier, I'd like to follow-up a little bit on the last question on the spending, IOCs, NOCs, international E&P, which you mentioned. We generally want to -- let's say, look at the oil strip or assume a flat oil price. If spending is going to increase second half '24, a fairly positive outlook as you showed kind of '25 and beyond. Would you characterize overall reinvestment by the industry is still too low? In other words, we don't need a higher oil price to get higher spending and investment or would you say we are simply dependent on oil prices. I'm just kind of curious the way you're looking at it from a, I guess, productive capacity these companies and countries need and where they sit on excess capacity today versus that oil price outlook.\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think I will turn it a little bit upside down and I realize that, well, our operators are looking at it a national company, IOCs, then looking at the demand that we continue to grow throughout the decade and realize that if they continue to execute on the capital discipline, they need to accelerate the supply coming from international market to fulfill this demand that we continue to grow and will put more pressure on the demand-supply balance. So some of them are responding for to capacity expansion program. Some of them are responding by accelerating the exploration appraisal or their development of existing international acreage that they have and development. So that's what we see. It applies to both for oil and gas. And gas is being more driven by regional dynamics on either consumption or gas security access, be it Asia or be it East Mediterranean to feed Europe, Asia for energy security and domestic consumption. Both these factors are driven by demand. The economics at the current level still favorable for long-cycle investment. The price of offshore international development and the economics have improved through the cycle, the benefits of efficiency, integration, technology have turned into making the offshore investment more attractive for the long run. Hence, it has reattracted investments. I will not try to comment on the industry needs more or less. I think the industry is certainly having the incentives today and have put a program in place with the FID pipeline that confirmed that it is attractive. It would be met with demand in the long outlook. Hence, our confidence into the longevity of the cycle internationally and into the breadth and resilience across oil and gas of the investment profile we are seeing from operators.\nRoger Read : And then the follow-up question that kind of ties into that. Obviously, a meaningful dividend raise here and a consistent increase in dividend from the COVID era. But as you look forward, recognizing it's the board that decides the dividend, but how should we think about the dividend evolving back to the sort of 2014 and 2019 era, when it was substantially higher than today? I know there have been some changes in acquisition and share count and all that, but whether it's an aggregate dollar dividend or a per share metric, how do you think about the dividend within the overall framework here?\nStephane Biguet: Thanks for the question, Roger. It's really the way we look at it is it goes beyond the dividend. We prefer looking at the total payout to shareholders, including buybacks. So the dividend itself, yes, 10%. We're happy. We can do this. We're happy it was approved by our board. It's on the back, of course, of the strong free cash flow generation we had in '23 and our confidence we can replicate that in the future. But we want to go at the right pace so that it remains sustainable in the future, and we can do more dividend increases in the future as long as they are reasonable. But again, total payout is what we are focusing on. We are increasing it from $2 billion in '23, including buybacks to hopefully more than 2.5 in 2024. So, if you back calculate this, of course, with the new amount of dividend, that means a minimum of $1 billion of share buybacks. And as the year evolves, we will review that every quarter, and we'll address that potentially above the $1 billion minimum as relevant.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, I'll turn the conference back to Olivier Le Peuch for closing comments. Please go ahead.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Leah. Ladies and gentlemen, as we conclude today's call, I would like to leave you with the following takeaways. First, our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results underscore SLB's differential ability to general returns throughout the cycle. We delivered strong revenue growth and free cash flow above expectations and continue to expand EBITDA and operating margins. With momentum across our three engines of growth and our returns-focused strategy in place, we will continue to build on this success in the year ahead. Second, the macro environment remains very compelling for our business with investment and activity predicated in international and offshore basins. Combined with tight service capacity and an emphasis on performance and digital, we are well positioned to expand our lead by delivering exceptional value to our customers. Finally, I remain very confident in our strategy and impressed by the outstanding performance of our teams. I'm fully confident in our ability to deliver our 2024 financial targets and continue increasing shareholder returns. I look forward to sharing our progress with you throughout the year. With this, I will conclude today's call. Thank you all for joining.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Stephane Biguet",
            "content": "Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Fourth quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits was $0.86. This represents an increase of $0.08 sequentially and an increase of $0.15 when compared to the same period of last year. We recorded $0.09 of charges during the fourth quarter of this year, $0.06 related to the devaluation of the peso in Argentina and the remaining $0.03 related to merger and integration costs associated with our acquisition of the Aker subsea business, which closed at the beginning of the quarter. We anticipate that we will incur additional charges as integration activities continue over the course of 2024. Our full year 2023 revenue of $33.1 million grew 18% year-on-year. While this revenue is roughly the same as the pre-pandemic level of 2019, our adjusted EBITDA in 2023 in absolute dollars was 22% higher. As a result, our full-year 2023 EBITDA margin of 24.5% has expanded 430 basis points over this period on a similar revenue base. This highlights the high grading of our portfolio over the last few years, our significantly improved operating leverage and our favorable market position, particularly internationally and offshore. Fourth quarter revenue of $8.99 billion increased 8% sequentially, with the acquired of Aker subsea business accounting for approximately 70% of the increase. Fourth quarter pretax operating margin of 20.8% improved 52 basis points sequentially and 101 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter of 25.3% was 95 basis points higher than the same period of last year. I will now go through the fourth quarter results for each division. Fourth quarter digital and integration revenue of $1 billion increased 7% sequentially, with pretax operating margin expanding 197 basis points to 34%. This growth was due to increased digital revenue across all areas, led by the Middle East and Asia and Europe and Africa. Reservoir Performance revenue of $1.7 million grew 3% sequentially, primarily due to increased activity internationally, mainly in the Middle East and Africa. Pretax operating margin increased 88 basis points to 21.4%, representing the highest level of this cycle, driven by higher activity and improved pricing. While construction revenue of $3.4 billion was essentially flat sequentially as international growth of 2% was offset by a decline in North America revenue resulting from lower U.S. land rig count. Pretax operating margin increased 35 basis points sequentially. Lastly, Production Systems revenue of $2.9 billion increased 24% sequentially, largely due to the acquired Aker subsea business. Excluding this effect, revenue grew 4% sequentially due to strong international sales. Pretax operating margin expanded 153 basis points to 15%, its highest-level this cycle on higher sales of midstream, artificial lift and subsea production systems. Looking ahead to the full year of 2024. We expect continued margin expansion in our core, driven by sustained operating leverage, a favorable geographic mix and pricing tailwinds. In our Digital and Integration division, we expect margins to remain approximately at the same level as 2023 as digital margins will increase due to the accelerated adoption of our new technology platforms, while APS margins will decrease as a result of higher amortization expenses. All in all, as mentioned by Olivier, strong year-on-year revenue growth and continued margin expansion will result in adjusted EBITDA growth in the mid-teens in 2024 when compared to 2023. Now turning to our liquidity. We generated $3 billion of cash flow from operations and $2.3 billion of free cash flow during the fourth quarter. This exceptional performance resulted in full year free cash flow of $4 billion, which is the highest level we have achieved since 2015. This was due to a combination of very strong year-end receivable cash collections, increased customer advances, improved inventory turns and the receipt of the prior year tax returns. As a result of this exceptional free cash flow performance, we reduced our net debt by $1.4 billion during the quarter to $8 billion. This represents our lowest net debt level since the first quarter of 2016. Capital investments, including CapEx and investments in APS projects and exploration data were $742 million in the fourth quarter and $2.6 billion for the full year. Looking ahead, we will continue to be disciplined as it relates to our capital investments. Despite the continued revenue growth, our 2024 capital investments will remain at approximately the same level as in 2023. Finally, during the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.8 million shares of our stock for a total purchase price of $100 million. For the full year, we returned a total of $2 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. Our continued capital discipline, combined with the confidence we have that 2024 will be another year of strong cash flow generation, which enable us to increase our returns to shareholders in 2024. In this regard, when combining the increased quarterly dividend that we announced today, with increased share repurchases, we are targeting to return more than $2.5 billion to our shareholders in 2024. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier. So look James, yes, we are still growing going into '24 and beyond. But this level of CapEx we spent in '23, we think remains adequate for this year as well because you have to think about the mix of activities as well amongst all divisions. So we think we can very well address the upcoming growth within this envelope without having to increase normally throughout the year, unless growth is much more than expected. But we were comfortable with this, and we will remain indeed within our guidance, and it's actually the low end of our guidance on the CapEx side. Scott, yes, we were also very pleased with the fourth quarter and full year free cash flow and indeed in the fourth quarter, it's coming almost entirely from the working capital. So now we do expect, as I say, 2024, to be another very strong year of free cash flow, and it will show the same quarterly pattern we usually see. So in the first quarter, the working capital will clearly increase. We have the payment of annual incentives to employees as you may know. And then we'll have the reversal of certain exceptional items that occurred in the last quarter of 2023. So we'll see the effect in Q1 as usual, but then this will be followed by a gradual improvement in subsequent quarters, in line with what we observed this year. So hopefully, we can have another very strong finish of the year in 12 months from now. And deliver a strong performance as well. Clearly, we see upside in '24 and continued margin expansion as we expressed earlier, really, the -- I'm sure you will calculate, but our guidance of mid-teens EBITDA growth in absolute dollars will be achieved with revenue growth, but clearly with margin expansion across our core and in digital, as I mentioned. So yes, we continue to see margin expansion. We have great operating leverage. We have pricing tailwinds in our in our backlog and new technology adoption, and this is pushing margins together with the favorable mix, as you well know, offshore is helping margins as well. So, it's subside -- it's continue to subside from now on. Thanks for the question, Roger. It's really the way we look at it is it goes beyond the dividend. We prefer looking at the total payout to shareholders, including buybacks. So the dividend itself, yes, 10%. We're happy. We can do this. We're happy it was approved by our board. It's on the back, of course, of the strong free cash flow generation we had in '23 and our confidence we can replicate that in the future. But we want to go at the right pace so that it remains sustainable in the future, and we can do more dividend increases in the future as long as they are reasonable. But again, total payout is what we are focusing on. We are increasing it from $2 billion in '23, including buybacks to hopefully more than 2.5 in 2024. So, if you back calculate this, of course, with the new amount of dividend, that means a minimum of $1 billion of share buybacks. And as the year evolves, we will review that every quarter, and we'll address that potentially above the $1 billion minimum as relevant."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Olivier Le Peuch",
            "content": "Thank you, James. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on the call today. In my prepared remarks, I will discuss our fourth quarter and full year results, highlight a number of achievements and share our thoughts on the outlook for 2024 and our financial ambitions. Stephane will then provide more detail on our financial results and will open the line for your questions. Let's begin. The fourth quarter was an impressive conclusion to the year's financial results. We grew revenue both sequentially and year-on-year and we achieved cycle high margins and cash flows during the quarter. Our strong performance was fueled by the international and offshore markets and was supported by robust sales in digital and integration of the acquired Aker subsea business. Throughout the year, we witnessed continued growth in the international and offshore markets, where customers are focused on enhanced production and capacity additions. We have also seen further investments in digital technologies for planning and operational efficiency. This is driving growth today and presenting opportunities into the future. The international shift in investment has accelerated during the year, with fourth quarter revenue growth driven by the Middle East and Asia and Europe and Africa, where we continue to benefit from long-cycle developments, capacity expansions and exploration appraisal activities. Specific to offshore, we delivered a very strong fourth quarter as we grew our legacy portfolio and harnessed a strong performance from our OneSubsea joint venture. On this note, I would like to extend my thanks to the entire Aker subsea team who have joined us three months ago and have already contributed very well to our strong year and results. Exiting the year, our international revenue and margins reached new cycle highs, marking our tenth consecutive quarter of year-on-year double-digit revenue growth on the international front. And we delivered exceptional free cash flow of $2.3 billion in the quarter. Next, let me reflect on our accomplishments for the full year. We fulfilled our full year financial ambitions, growing revenue by 18%, surpassing our revenue growth target for the year and achieving adjusted EBITDA growth in the mid-20s. Additionally, we generated $4 billion in free cash flow, our highest since 2015. In the core, across production systems, Reservoir Performance and well construction, we grew revenue by more than 20% and expanded pre-tax operating margins by almost 300 basis points. This was driven by strong activity internationally and offshore, new technology deployment and strong product sales. Notably, we achieved our highest ever revenue in the Middle East, led by impressive growth in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and the East Mediterranean. Offshore also contributed positive momentum, led by remarkable growth in Brazil and Angola and very solid increases in the U.S., Gulf of Mexico, Guyana and Norway. This was supported by the contribution from the acquired Aker subsea business, which enabled us to expand in certain markets, mainly in Norway and Australia. Additionally, our fit-for-basin business model continued to deliver differentiated value in North America, resulting in revenue growth outperforming to the record. In digital, we continue to witness the adoption of our digital workflows and data AI platform as customers work to enhance efficiency and returns by integrating our connected and autonomous trading data and AI solutions. We now have more than 6,000 Delfi users and have generated 125 million compute hours, both representing more than 40% growth year-on-year. As a result, we achieved full year digital revenue of more than $2 billion with our new technology platforms comprised of cloud, edge and AI, growing at a CAGR of 60% since 2021. In new energy, we forged new partnerships and made new investments in capture technology for carbon capture and storage. We are seeing very positive momentum in this space. And we are actively participating in more than $400 million of CCS tenders globally. Additionally, in short-term and energy, we are partnering with government agencies in the Middle East on lower carbon electricity and in Europe on zero carbon heating and cooling solutions. As we advance our three engines of growth, we also continue to deliver for our customers and stakeholders, by achieving our lowest-recordable injury rate and highest level of operational reliability on record. This is also reflected in industry surveys, where we are growing customer satisfaction through performance and value creation. Finally, we reduced our emission intensity across Scope 1, 2, and 3 on the path to achieving our 2025 emissions reductions commitment. Moving forward, we are well-positioned to capture further growth, and I look forward to building on this strong success in the year ahead. I want to thank the entire SLB team for delivering these impressive results. Turning to the macro. The characteristics of breadth, resilience and durability that have defined this cycle remain fully in place. This continues to be supported by the imperative of energy security to meet rising global demand, confirming our belief in the longevity of the cycle. After a year of demand growth in 2023, we anticipate further growth in 2024 that will continue to support the ongoing multiyear investment cycle. In international markets, growth momentum is set to continue with more than two-thirds of total investment taking place in the Middle East, offshore and gas resource plays. In the Middle East, growth will be led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which continue to commit significant investments to increase production capacity in both oil and on commercial gas, followed by Iraq and Kuwait. Meanwhile, in Asia, countries such as China, Malaysia, Indonesia and India are leading new gas exploration and development. Across our international basins, we anticipate strong activity led by Brazil and followed by West Africa and Australia. Looking across this wide baseload of activity, a significant portion is taking place offshore, while capital expenditure will continue their growth momentum in 2024. As a result, the rig count will continue to rise, mainly in the Middle East and Asia, responding to a strong FID pipeline in both shallow and deepwater. All in all, we see the potential for more than $100 billion in global offshore FIDs in both 2024 and 2025, underscoring the enduring strength of the offshore markets and supporting a very favorable subsea outlook for years to come. In this context, although geopolitical tensions persist in several regions, we do not expect any significant impact to activity in 2024, absent further escalation. Additionally, although we have witnessed short-term commodity price fluctuate over the past few months, long-cycle investment in the Middle East, offshore and gas markets remain decoupled from short-term pricing, which will continue to support the resilience of these markets. In North America, following a noticeable moderation of activity in the later part of 2023, we anticipate capital discipline to continue. Consequently, investment levels will be sustained at 2023 exit rates with minimum -- minimal increase in activity as the vision focused on sustaining record ARPU from last year. This will drive further adoption of technology as operators aim to further improve efficiency and recovery rates. Now let me explain how we expect these factors to drive our performance in 2024. In the international markets, we expect full year revenue growth reaching the mid-teens, led by the Middle East and Asia and Europe and Africa. This growth will take place both onshore and offshore, with offshore benefiting from our newly formed OneSubsea joint venture, which enters the year with close to $4.5 billion of subsea production system backlog. We expect to deliver more than $4 billion in additional subsea bookings in 2024, open increase of more than 25% year-on-year as the market continues to expect. For clarity, when excluding the impact of Aker contribution and the expected decline in Russia, we expect double-digit international growth for the year. Meanwhile, in North America, although activity has moderated, we expect full year revenue growth reaching the mid-single digits, driven by our technology and leverage portfolio in both U.S. land and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Turning to the divisions. We expect all core divisions to grow led by Production Systems and Reservoir Performance. Digital integration is also expected to grow with digital growing in the high teens, primarily driven by new technology platforms, while APS remains flat. Directionally, we expect further margin expansions, driven by tight service capacity internationally, pricing and increased technology adoption. This will result in year-on-year EBITDA growth in the mid-teens. With continued growth in earnings, our profitability to generate cash and confidence in the long-term outlook, we are pleased to announce that the Board of Directors have approved a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend. And we'll also increase our share repurchase program in 2024. Combined, we are targeting a return to return more than $2.5 billion to shareholders in 2024, an increase of more than 25% compared to 2023. Looking to the first quarter. We anticipate the typical pattern of activity beginning with the combined effects of seasonality and the absence of year-end digital sales. As a result, on a year-on-year basis, we expect first quarter revenue growth in the low-teens and EBITDA growth in the mid-teens. This will be followed by an activity rebound in the second quarter and further acceleration of growth in the second half of the year, particularly in the international markets. This will support the ambition we have set for the full year revenue and earnings growth. I will now turn the call over to Stephane. Thank you, Stephane. Ladies and gentlemen, I think we will start the Q&A. So Leah, back to you. No, that's correct. I think, James, thank you for laying out, I think, the theme of offshore, I think offshore is a distinct attribute of this cycle as really already delivered in terms of total activity visible beyond 2019 and includes both shallow and deepwater that have both grown visibly in the last 24 months. Shallow mainly driven by addition of rigs that we continue to see coming in the Middle East and Asia region and deepwater across all the deepwater basins. And we anticipate, albeit at a more moderate rate for deepwater and shallow, the rig activity to continue to increase and the exit rate of '24 to be above in terms of rig count, offshore rig count, total offshore rig count, the total exit range of '23. As a benefit, I think both the offshore activity and deepwater, where we have the benefit of the scale with our subsea venture will benefit. Hence, we continue to see growth, not only in '24, but running out to '25 and beyond. As I said, the total FID offshore keeps paying $100 million for each of '24 and '25, and this is not only supporting activity next year and '25, but support longevity of offshore investment beyond. So we are -- we remain very constructive on that environment. And yes, we see the exit rate to be above the last December in 12 months from now. Yes. Thank you, Dave. I think we have been very pleased with the activity and the way we have been able to turn this activity growth in the last 18 months and the last 12 months, particularly into revenue, benefiting from our strength on the ground in the Middle East. I think I would characterize beyond the capacity expansion and on commercial gas, which is a dual benefit for activity. I will also characterize the activity in the Middle East to be very broad. It's not two country leading this, it's almost every country in the region that we see further activity and will derive from its further revenue growth. So we are not at capacity. We don't see an inflection down of our revenue growth potential in the region, benefiting from our technology market position with every national company in the region and capability for integration to harness the part of our technology into performance for our customers, hence delivering higher revenue from rate of activity. So we are confident. When it comes to our capacity, yes, equipment capacity and everybody has been disciplined in the region. And hence, we have been responding and benefiting from pricing in the last 18 months. And as a consequence, our margins have expanded in the region and have supported what you have seen as our international margin expansion year-on-year have been a driver for margin expansion internationally. We expect this to continue as we execute 2024. But again, it's a long duration cycle, both by the nature of the investment decoupled from short-term pricing on commodities. So we remain very confident about our market position first and the market outlook and our ability to differentiate through performance, integration, technology and then continue this success in '24 and '25 and again, well into the second half of the decade. Okay. Let me come back first on some metrics that I think we have highlighted into my opening remarks. And I think this relates to the adoption of Delfi indeed, adoption of a number of users, use of cloud compute on our Delfi platform and use of additional hedge or AI capability that we offer to customers. The combination of which, as I said, has grown 60% in the last two years on a CAGR rate and the adoption metrics that we shared, both the number of users and the number of hours of complete power that we serve to our customers on the cloud have been growing by 40%. So yes, the adoption is going, both measured by, as I always said, one customer at a the time that transition from our legacy desktop offering to our cloud. And by expansion of our workflows, data, AI capability that we offer to existing or new customers. So it's a combination of a transition of the existing customers to the cloud and adoption of data and AI capability because we are offering our platform that the industry is recognizing adopting. And finally, and maybe one of the most exciting parts that adds a dimension of growth is the digital operation, both drilling and production digital operation. You have seen some of the announcements that have been highlighted in recent weeks and months. And last week, further alignment with a partner to accelerate doing automation and autonomous systems. So the drilling adoption on the operation production with our partner, Cognite. And this is supplementing, I would say, the core growth of transitioning our real sound customers from desktop to the cloud. So you have three dimensions. You have the cloud transition with existing customers and adoption of new customers coming to SaaS solution. You have the data and AI. It's a new market. It's a reverse of the data management that scale into the cloud and AI, unlocking the power of data through AI in our industry; and finally, digital operation. These three trends are supporting our growth ambition, both this year and next year. And this span all the customer segment across the globe, and you keep seeing some announcement of customer adoption on our solutions. No, I think you are correct first in stating that this is the distinct from our focus on the five themes that we have in new energy. And this thing from the CCS, I mentioned where we have a lot of success in geothermal. And it represents a portfolio of technology that we have, that we are developing, that we are promoting to our customers that have a distinct lower emission carbon intensity compared to existing or legacy technology and have net effect on our customer for their Scope 1 or their Scope 3 upstream as we call it, emissions, but also have the characteristic to bring efficiency. So customer is looking for low-cost, low-carbon outlook and continue to adopt this technology by contrast with alternate technology that exists in the market as they deliver not only lower carbon, but also deliver higher efficiency, which are the way we characterize this technology. So yes, we are very pleased adoption. Some technology are very unique like almost zero-carbon cement solution. Some solutions are really game-changing such as some of our both processing subsea processing solution that having a net impact on the carbon footprint of subsea operation. Some technology are disrupting for the future, such as electrical full subsea and electrical full completion technology. And hence, we are seeing accelerated adoption of this. And finally, we say that we are also seeing following the COP 28 much more interest into our methane emission management solution, and you have had the announcement we made with Eni, supporting them as a global company to make an assessment and be assessing their emission intensity from methane and proposing abatement solutions. So this is a mix of technician will continue to be going in our technology mix and that supports our ambition for sustainable future and a balanced planet, but also aligned with our customers on lower carbon, lower-cost future. Thank you, Luke. I think, let me please first with the first quarter of the subsea joint venture we have with Aker and Subsea7. I think the results speak for themselves. I think it was a direct contributor to the PS, the pollution system, performance in the fourth quarter, both on the top line and the margins. So we are very pleased. And I think as I said, I could not be more pleased than this. Now going forward, I think our objective continues to be to extract more value to synergy and to fully seize this deepwater offshore cycle that is in full fledge happening and where we see, as I said earlier, a strong outlook. So our priority is still benefit from integration capability, and as you have seen that we have announced some alliance and one of them with BP, where I think customers are approaching us organizing that subsea integration capability across the SPS and SURF are augmented by our ability to deliver and understand the reservoir as well as deliver well construction. So hence, opportunity to have integrated asset development, integrated tieback delivery and more opportunity in the space that is a full intake subsea and beyond to extract better economics and to extract more importantly -- equally importantly, a higher recovery combining our reservoir subsurface domain expertise are well placement and our subsea boosting and processing capability, all combined to extract and create a little bit of more value for subsea market going forward from economics and from production recovery. So that's where we see trends coming. And we have a portfolio that is unique with the portfolio partially on the boosting and processing and tieback capability that is unmatched in the market. And we have digital reservoir technology and our core portfolio that complements this and help and will support this alliance integration capability. So I can only be pleased with the prospects ahead of us and the feedback from our customers so far is very positive on our capability. Yes, thank you. I think, yes, we have commented before that we have seen resurgence and rebound of exploration activity solution appraisal in the last two or three years. This cycle has added exploration activity back to the cycle. And I think it has been driven by the desire to find new gas reserves to respond to the gas supply security concerns. And also, it has benefited from the continued exploration of oil around the existing offshore hubs in the form of infrastructure-led exploration. And also, in New Frontier replicating the success that Exxon had in Guyana and over basins. So when you look at it from where it is happening, what is unique in this cycle, it's happening everywhere. We have exploration activity, mostly offshore, that's where I think the actual success of new reserves have been mostly and in all offshore basins, both shallow and deepwater, infrastructure-led exploration in existing mature or deepwater markets and in New Frontier. So you have seen New Frontier happening in Namibia. You have New Frontier in Suriname and upcoming Brazil control margin. You have exploration in East -- West Colombia side. You have a furthermore in West Africa South. And you have what is maybe a little bit new this cycle, more exposure coming back in Asia from India, as I said, to Malaysia, China. And I think this is what constitutes a little bit of the unique cycle is broad. And it is here in our opinion to stay because the economics of offshore have improved significantly over the last couple of cycles and attribute of reserves, both gas and oil with low carbon intensity and the ability to deliver a long plateau of production is unique. So access to offshore acreage, better economics, better quality of potential geological reserves have all driven this, and we have increased the success. And we have exposure in reservoir performance with reservoir performance evaluation segments that are benefiting from it and has introduced technology that are really in high demand like Ora. And we have a lot of exposure, obviously, as well in the digital segment with our seismic data capability processing and our digital geoscience offering that both benefit from this as a consumption. So we are pleased with the market position we have, and we believe that this exposure appraisal is here to stay because it's very broad, diverse and across many basins partly in offshore. Yes. I think first, you have to realize that the capacity expansion program announced by the multiple country that have met their commitments extend from 27 to 30 plus, 30, 35 or 40 from the last country that have expanded this. And hence, I think the capacity will be -- continue to be seeing addition both land and offshore to respond to that capacity expansion. Gas, I think, is here for the long in the Middle East for 2 reasons. First, there are gas reserves that are really at a very good economic point, partially in Qatar, and we continue to present an LNG feed to the global gas market, but also unconventional reserves are seeing a significant investment, and we expect this to actually grow fast in the coming years in two or three countries that are focused on commercial gas. So the combination of this is giving us the confidence that the record ever investment that we have seen last year in Middle East will continue in \u201824, \u201825 and has potential to expand well into the second half of the decade. No, we're very pleased with our performance in North America in retrospect in 2023 as we visibly outperformed the rig count, and we were able to grow in sequentially visibly. And we expect indeed to continue to outperform the market, and it comes from multiple factors, the mix factor of exposure we have with great exposure in Gulf of Mexico as well as East Canada and Alaska, we will see a potential of technology adoption and giving us the benefits of our mix. But also in the U.S. land market, I think we had a transition to a fit-for-basin and technology leverage focused portfolio in U.S. land and to some extent, in Canada. And we have seen this as a success with adoption of some really unique drilling technology in particular digital CCS giving us the tailwind to outperform the market in 2023, and we see this continuing. Now the priority for customers remain clearly efficiency and recovery in U.S. land market and hence, more efficiency on the trading well construction side, more recovery, use of digital, use of ESPs and also low carbon when it matters. We'll continue to make the impact and serve us very well. And the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and offshore market performance through integration performance to execution and reliability of our execution, I think, will continue to be paramount for our customers. And as long as we continue to deliver at this level, we'll get rewarded with market position and contract and pricing. And hence, we'll be able to outperform the recount, hence our guidance up to reaching the mid-single digit in 2024 against the market outlook. Thank you, Arun. I think if I were to characterize at the highest level, I think that we have seen significant traction in the last two years and rebound of investment internationally by the international company with a delay coming from the contractual nature and also from the investment execution decision for a national company. We anticipate national company to actually grow faster in -- as we turn into 2024 led in particular by the Middle East region with leading NOCs clearly going. But I think the momentum we have gained, which was leading the pack to some extent in IOC in 2023. We expect due to the nature of our mix offshore exposure still a very solid exploration appraisal for a few of them will continue to give us momentum in the IOCs internationally. And I will not forget about the international independents that have a market position, partly in some offshore markets, and they are continuing to execute on their plan. And so we are pleased, and I think we are looking forward to the national company accelerating their relatively speaking, their growth in 2024 compared to the IOCs. I think as you remember and just resetting the scene for everyone, I think we had identified five domains in which we believe we have adjacency. We have potential, and we have a technology portfolio, we believe, to bring to market and disrupt and participate in new energy at scale. CCS showed you geothermal, geo-energy, energy storage, critical mineral. And hydrogen that are both -- that all of them have different horizons of growth and different scale potential for us. So, we have been, for the last two or three years, seeding investments, developing organically and inorganically technology position. We are very pleased with the momentum in CCS and geothermal going ahead of our expectation in terms of -- for CCS sequestration studies and participation to exploration in this market. And geothermal by its growth potential going beyond the established basins. So we believe that our $3 billion target would be a combination of organic growth on this adjacent market and inorganic development into the non-adjacent market. And we believe that CCS is likely to be leading in terms of potential contributor to this ambition, followed by likely hydrogen starting to be in a position that will more impact later part of the cycle in the next decade. So, we feel confident by the early investment we are making. I will feel confident about the development of the market, the support of the incentive across many regions and the early stage of success in CCS particularly as we execute this. I think I will turn it a little bit upside down and I realize that, well, our operators are looking at it a national company, IOCs, then looking at the demand that we continue to grow throughout the decade and realize that if they continue to execute on the capital discipline, they need to accelerate the supply coming from international market to fulfill this demand that we continue to grow and will put more pressure on the demand-supply balance. So some of them are responding for to capacity expansion program. Some of them are responding by accelerating the exploration appraisal or their development of existing international acreage that they have and development. So that's what we see. It applies to both for oil and gas. And gas is being more driven by regional dynamics on either consumption or gas security access, be it Asia or be it East Mediterranean to feed Europe, Asia for energy security and domestic consumption. Both these factors are driven by demand. The economics at the current level still favorable for long-cycle investment. The price of offshore international development and the economics have improved through the cycle, the benefits of efficiency, integration, technology have turned into making the offshore investment more attractive for the long run. Hence, it has reattracted investments. I will not try to comment on the industry needs more or less. I think the industry is certainly having the incentives today and have put a program in place with the FID pipeline that confirmed that it is attractive. It would be met with demand in the long outlook. Hence, our confidence into the longevity of the cycle internationally and into the breadth and resilience across oil and gas of the investment profile we are seeing from operators. Thank you, Leah. Ladies and gentlemen, as we conclude today's call, I would like to leave you with the following takeaways. First, our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results underscore SLB's differential ability to general returns throughout the cycle. We delivered strong revenue growth and free cash flow above expectations and continue to expand EBITDA and operating margins. With momentum across our three engines of growth and our returns-focused strategy in place, we will continue to build on this success in the year ahead. Second, the macro environment remains very compelling for our business with investment and activity predicated in international and offshore basins. Combined with tight service capacity and an emphasis on performance and digital, we are well positioned to expand our lead by delivering exceptional value to our customers. Finally, I remain very confident in our strategy and impressed by the outstanding performance of our teams. I'm fully confident in our ability to deliver our 2024 financial targets and continue increasing shareholder returns. I look forward to sharing our progress with you throughout the year. With this, I will conclude today's call. Thank you all for joining."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the SLB Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Industry Affairs, James McDonald. Please go ahead.\nJames McDonald: Thank you, Leah. Good morning, and welcome to the SLB third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Today's call is being hosted from New York City, following our Board meeting, held earlier this week. Joining us on the call are Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Executive Officer; and Stephane Biguet, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind all participants that some of the statements we will be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and our other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our third quarter press release, which is on our website. With that, I will turn the call over to Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, James. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on the call today. In my remarks this morning, I will begin by reviewing the third quarter financial results we represented in today\u2019s earnings release. Then I will discuss the progress we are achieving across our three engines of growth and the macro environment supporting that. And finally, I will share our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year. Stephane will then provide more details on our financial results, and we will open the line to your questions. Our third quarter results are built upon the positive momentum we established in the first half of the year and firmly position us to achieve our full year financial ambitions. We continued to grow revenue and adjusted EBITDA both sequentially and year-on-year, and we generated free cash flow of $1 billion for the second consecutive quarter. Internationally, we continued to seize the cycle. We achieved our highest international revenue quarter since 2015 by growing revenue in this market for the ninth consecutive quarter year-on- year. This was particularly visible in the Middle East & Asia, where we posted 22% year-on-year revenue growth, led by significant growth in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, and Egypt. Our strong international activity was further augmented by resilient investment in the offshore markets, notably in Africa, Brazil, and Scandinavia. Offshore continues to offer many opportunities for our business, and I will shortly discuss how the recent closing of our OneSubsea Joint Venture with Aker Solutions and Subsea7 will help us to expand our footprint in the market moving forward. And in North America, although revenue decreased sequentially due to lower activity, we continued to grow year-on-year, outperforming the rig count. Once again, our focus on the quality of our revenue combined with the differentiated value we deliver through technology drove margin expansion. Our EBITDA margin reached a new cycle high of 25% and our pre-tax segment operating margin expanded for the 11th consecutive quarter year-on-year. These are very positive results and I want to thank the entire SLB team for delivering this strong performance. Next, I would like to share some updates about our progress across our three engines of growth: Core, Digital, and New Energy. Let me begin with the Core. The oil and gas sector continues to benefit from a broad, durable, and resilient multiyear growth cycle that is being supported by long-cycle developments, production capacity expansions, exploration and appraisal, and the recognition of gas as a critical fuel source for the energy transition. These market fundamentals remain very compelling for our Core business, which has grown 22% year-to-date and has materially expanded margins. This strong performance is being driven by the diversity of our portfolio, our industry leading technology, and our unique integration capabilities. Reservoir Performance achieved exceptional results with stronger evaluation activity; Production Systems achieved its highest level of margins in the cycle led by Subsea, Surface, and Artificial Lift; and Well Construction maintained impressive results through new technology innovations and differentiated performance. All in all, this was a very strong quarter across our Core divisions. The supportive macro environment is also leading operators to make long cycle investments offshore, where advances in efficiency have significantly improved project economics. We have visibility into FIDs extending well beyond 2025, and there couldn't be a better time to join forces with Aker Solutions and Subsea7 to drive a new era for subsea. Today, SLB is recognized for its unique ability to handle large, complex, and fully integrated offshore projects from subsurface development to midstream processing. Through our OneSubsea joint venture we will further enhance this offering by bringing new levels of technology and partnership to the market. Together, our companies are the clear leader in subsea multiphase boosting and subsea gas compression, and we will provide electrification and digital solutions to further enhance the business. This partnership approach will also create a more flexible customer offering through scale, increased capacity, and life of field services. Collectively, this will drive meaningful change to subsea asset performance as we partner with customers to help them unlock their reserves, drive efficiency, reduce cycle times, and reduce emissions in the deepwater market. Now, let me turn to Digital. On our call last quarter, I shared an update on the emerging digital trends shaping the industry. These included the adoption of cloud computing, the power of data and AI at scale, and digital operations gaining maturity. At a recent investor conference, I discussed how SLB is capitalizing on this opportunity with our platform strategy comprising of a workflow platform that serves as the backbone for our customers' planning and operations and our data and AI platform that unlocks data at scale for digital transformation. Today, we are seeing increased digital adoption across the industry. Delfi continued its year-over-year growth momentum with a 49% increase in users and an 89 -- 86% increase in compute hours compared to the third quarter last year. Additionally, our customers are embracing our connected and autonomous drilling solutions, with 1.9 million feet of automated drilling completed in the third quarter, an increase of 60% year-over-year. As a result, SLB\u2019s platforms representing our new digital technology offering, sustained growth at a CAGR rate of about 60%. The benefit of these technologies is clear, and you can see this illustrated in our earnings press release this morning, with our Shell/AWS collaborative agreement and the Kuwait Energy Basra Limited digital oilfield contract serving as just two recent examples of customers choosing SLB Digital technology to reimagine their workflows across the E&P value chain. And finally, let me quickly discuss some of the exciting opportunities in our New Energy business and Transition Technologies portfolio. As we address the energy trilemma, our industry has an imperative to decarbonizes operations. Two of the most immediate opportunities to do this are reducing methane emissions and scaling CCUS as a solution for mitigating climate change. Regarding methane, we have opportunities to address fugitive methane and flaring through better monitoring and leak detection. A few weeks ago, we launched a new IoT enabled methane point instrument for continuous monitoring that seamlessly connects to our methane digital platform for insights and analysis, eliminating the need for intermittent site visits and enabling operators to quickly scale up across their operations. This and other solutions are available today to help clients abate their methane emissions. And in CCUS, momentum is building across the industry, both in oil and gas as well as in other hard-to-abate sectors. SLB is actively involved in more than 20 CCUS projects globally and we are investing in capture technology, as underscored by the partnership with TDA Research-highlighted in our earnings release. Overall, we are pleased with our pipeline of technology and projects, and we have confidence that by establishing ourselves as a leader in this space, we will create yet another avenue for diversified long-term growth. Now, I will turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year. In the fourth quarter, we expect continued sequential revenue growth driven by year-end Digital sales and seasonal product and equipment sales in Production Systems. The quarter will also reflect the results of the OneSubsea joint venture. As a result, we expect overall sequential revenue growth to be in the high-single digits. With our continued focus on the quality of revenue, harnessing operating leverage, and further technology adoption, we expect to maintain global pre-tax segment operating and EBITDA margins at their highest levels in the cycle, in line with our third quarter performance. Stephane will provide additional color on the net contribution of the OneSubsea joint venture on our fourth quarter guidance. Turning to the full year, we expect to achieve the financial ambitions we shared back in January. Excluding the effects of the OneSubsea joint venture, we expect to conclude the year by increasing revenue more than 15% and growing EBITDA in the mid-20s, with recent North American headwinds being more than offset by strong international growth. With these strong full year results, we will remain well positioned to continue returning value to our shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Stephane.\nStephane Biguet: Thank you, Olivier and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Third quarter earnings per share was $0.78. This represents an increase of $0.06 sequentially and $0.15 when compared to the third quarter of last year. We did not record any charges or credits during any of those periods. Overall, our third quarter revenue of $8.3 billion increased 3% sequentially. International sequential revenue growth of 5% was led by the Middle East and Asia, which increased 8% while North America revenue decreased 6%. Sequentially, pre-tax segment operating margin increased 73 basis points, which resulted in incremental margins of 48% largely due to the high-quality international revenue. Company-wide adjusted EBITDA margin for the third quarter reached 25%, the highest level since 2015. On a year-on-year basis, third quarter revenue increased 11% as international revenue grew 12%, while North America revenue increased 6%. The strong international performance was led by broad-based growth across the Middle East and Asia and offshore markets. Let me now go through the third quarter results for each division. Third quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $982 million increased 4% sequentially with margins decreasing 2 percentage points to 32%. The sequential revenue growth was primarily driven by increased APS revenue and increased digital revenue, including higher sales of exploration data licenses. Margins declined sequentially as lower profitability in APS more than offset improved digital margins. Reservoir Performance revenue of $51.7 billion increased 2% sequentially while margins improved 190 basis points to 20.5%. These increases were due to strong international growth, a favorable technology mix and improved pricing. Well Construction revenue of $3.4 billion increased 2% sequentially led by strong growth in the Middle East and Asia which was partially offset by lower revenue in North America. Margins of 22.1% increased 38 basis points driven by the international markets. Finally, Production Systems revenue of $2.4 billion increased 2% sequentially as international revenue increased 7% led by the Middle East and Asia and Latin America. North America revenue decreased by 8% due to lower subsea activity. Margins expanded 147 basis points to 13.5% representing the highest margin since we began reporting results for the division. This expansion was primarily driven by higher sales of completions, artificial lift and surface production systems as well as pricing improvements. Now turning to our liquidity. During the quarter, we generated $1.7 billion of cash flow from operations and free cash flow of just over $1 billion. As a result of this strong cash flow performance, our net debt reduced sequentially by $731 million to $9.4 billion. Our net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA leverage ratio of 1.2 is at its lowest level since 2015. Capital investments, inclusive of CapEx and investments in APS projects and exploration data, were $640 million in the third quarter. For the full year, we are still expecting capital investments to be approximately $2.5 million to $2.6 billion. We repurchased 2.6 million shares of our stock during the quarter for a total purchase price of $151million. We continue to target to return $2 billion to our shareholders this year between dividends and stock buybacks. Before closing, I would like to add some color to the Q4 outlook that Olivier just provided. We are expecting sequential fourth quarter revenue growth to be in the high-single digits with pre-tax margins remaining at the same high-level we achieved in the third quarter. As Olivier highlighted, this outlook includes the contribution from the recently acquired Aker subsea business, which will be consolidated under our Production Systems division starting in the fourth quarter. The Aker subsea business is expected to contribute approximately $400 million to $500 million of incremental revenue in the fourth quarter with pre-tax operating margins in the low teens. Therefore, excluding the effects of the acquired Aker subsea business, SLB's fourth quarter sequential revenue growth is expected to be similar to the sequential revenue growth we experienced in the third quarter. SLB's organic pre-tax operating margin, again excluding the effects of the acquired Aker business, is expected to continue expanding sequentially. After considering the impact of below the line items relating to this joint venture such as amortization of intangibles, taxes, and non-controlling interest, this transaction is expected to be slightly accretive to our fourth quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits. In closing, we are very excited about the prospects of this venture, which strengthens our offshore portfolio and has the potential to deliver more than $100 million of net annual synergies starting year three after closing. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Stephane. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now open the line for your questions. Leah, if you may open the lines.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of James West with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nJames West: Hey, good morning, Olivier and Stephane.\nStephane Biguet: Good morning, James.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Good morning.\nJames West: So, Olivier, I know you recently returned from [technical difficulty] and most likely met with all of the major oil producers in the region. Can you [technical difficulty] thoughts on the Middle East and how we should think about the Middle East with respect to Schlumberger over the next several years, because it looks like it's going to be a huge driver of growth.\nOlivier Le Peuch: No, thank you, James. I hope everybody could catch your question right into Middle East. Indeed, I have the privilege to be there for about a weekend and not only went to the conference and met a lot of customers in the region, but also had the benefit to go to operation in Saudi and visit the customer in south over there. So great insights. Needless to say that this is clearly the largest investment cycle, its clean on the way. The momentum is set. It's not about the concept and I think the sentiment across [indiscernible] shall be positive. Leah, there's a noise on the \u2026\nOperator: Yes, Mr. West, if you could mute your phone sir. Okay, you may proceed.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you. So if I were to characterize attributes, I think breadth, resilience, durability that we have characterized for the full cycle, I think are very much in full display in Middle East. I think the Durability 27 is the target for capital expansion. Breadth is not only old, but it's also gas as a driver for general vision or gas consumption and energy exports. Its offshore and onshore, its conventional and unconventional, and goes beyond one or two country that are very well known into Kuwait, into Iraq, into Egypt and more. And it's clearly decoupled from some of the short-term uncertainty. So it's all made about of long-term contract from the re-contracting to the service contract. And we are clear beneficiary of this situation. We have a unique footprint in the region. And indeed, we see that this will continue to support growth in the years to come for SLB. And this year, as stated before, we will record a record revenue in the region. And we will continue to grow and use this to be accretive to international growth and accretive to our international margin and the company. A great outlook in essence.\nJames West: That's great. Thanks, Olivier for that. Sorry about my phone issues here. Probably a follow-up for me, maybe for Stephane is on FX. How much was FX a headwind during the quarter?\nStephane Biguet: So, thanks, James. So, look, most of our revenue is built in U.S dollars. But indeed in a few countries, it's partially not the case for. So for some of us, we indeed had an unfavorable impact of the U.S dollar strengthening against local currencies. And that was both sequentially and year-on-year. I prefer I'm not giving you a specific amount as we have contractual adjustment clauses that come and offset the negative effect at least partially, but yes the revenue would have been slightly higher without that. And the last point here to remember is a lot of our cost as well are expressed in local currency. So we have a natural hedge on this. And the net impact on the earnings is quite marginally, it's limited.\nOperator: We will move on to David Anderson with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nDavid Anderson: Thank you. Good morning. Morning, Olivier. With Aker now part of the -- with Aker now part of the OneSubsea JV, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the value proposition of not only a larger subsidy entity, but how it fits kind of within the whole -- how now fits in a fully consolidated market. In terms of offshore worth in FIDs, obviously, the trending really couldn't be any better, but what is the larger, more robust OneSubsea going to Schlumberger as a whole? And then as a follow-up, if you could talk about some of the integration steps you're planning, culture is such a big part of Schlumberger. Just wondering how you're thinking about bringing in one of your long standing competitors into the fold and -- how do you think about culture in that sense? Thank you.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Great question, Dave. And I think indeed, we have been working on this. I'm very, very proud and I believe that the timing couldn't be better that closing this now as the onset of the offshore growth and the long duration that we see with SLB beyond 2025. So, if I had to take three key words, I would say technology fit, integration capability and scale are the three elements that I think resonate very well and create value for customers. Technology, whether we are enhancing and getting with this addition of a comprehensive portfolio that is fit to every deeper market that exists and that includes further capability, complimentary and capability in Subsea processing and also in own vehicles [ph] that complete the portfolio and allow us to fully participate and being differentiated in every basin, in every deepwater condition in the world. Integration, we bring and we keep our unique subsurface reservoir to processing capability that we had already in OneSubsea. But we are enhancing it with a larger and a very competent team running us for from a acquisition and engineering capability. So that we can take any deeper prospect and help customers and collaborate to get the best outcome and we are getting our Subsea7 partner to joining and to be aligned with making this a success, when and as we are required to deliver as integrated with us. So all in all, this is what the value brings in integration. Scale. Scale give us manufacturing footprint that give us flexibility, and the ability to respond fast and to respond to customer need everywhere and give us the unique life of field with the largest install base of subsidiary, where we will use digital ,we will use integration capability with our performance to provide further integration and further life of field and looking pollution recovery, if you like, long-term. So customer feedback is excellent at the onset. I think the customer really appreciate and recognize the recovery potential, the comprehensive technology portfolio, the lower emission, the digital and the integration capability. Culture. I think we have discovered throughout this engagement, that actually the culture are very much aligned. And I think we have had a day one set of events last week or 2 weeks ago that we're really our planning are aligned we are and our complementary culture and portfolio are to go into this. So I'm very optimistic, very positive and customer feedback is extremely positive to onboard this. And you may have seen the [indiscernible] in my opinion, which is a precursor, in our opinion, is what we can do to partner with our customers and to help unlock the future of subsea reserves and to impact their recovery, their efficiency and economics and their lower carbon outlook.\nDavid Anderson: Obviously, all things that your customers are looking to achieve. If I could shift over to your digital business. Just more specifically, digital within D&I. APS has been kind of noisy this year between Canada and Ecuador. Kind of hard for us to get a real sense as to what's happening in software. In your release, you talked about higher sales or margins. I was wondering if you could provide a little more context around that. Have margins improved from a year ago? Is it necessarily about margins? You just gave some interesting statistics about increasing number of users, increasing computing time, and you also said 60% growth. Can you just repeat exactly what you meant by that? Is that the top line of that business? Thank you.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yes. I think we -- thank you, James (sic) [David]. I think we continue to be very positive about the digital business and its adoption with our customers. You will continue to see announcement being made from workflow and adoption for customers and also more and more announcement of digital operation, edge, AI, as you have seen many of them into our press release earlier today. So we are very satisfied with the momentum. And it's going, it's going fairly well. I think you are seeing that we have quoted that the new technology digital portfolio from workflows to operation is growing at a CAGR of about 60%. And I think this is in line with what we expected. And this is on top of the baseline that includes the legacy software maintenance and all the services, including the data sales that we do, that is somehow offsetting some of this, but still represents total growth. So we expect this growth to be very visible into the fourth quarter as we typically have a year-end sales effect. And we continue -- we expect this to continue and accelerate actually next year.\nDavid Anderson: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Next, we move to the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nScott Gruber: Yes, good morning. Question on \u2026\nOlivier Le Peuch: Good morning.\nScott Gruber: \u2026 the Production Systems outlook for margins post the Aker JV. Just how should we think about the path forward for margins in the business? I'm thinking about legacy contracts in Subsea rolling out that are largely lower margin, better price contracts rolling in. And then as you capture synergies, just what is a reasonable expectation for incrementals or where margins could go overall in Production Systems out over the next 2 years?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think, Scott, simply said, we believe that we'll continue to have -- continue our journey of margin expansion. As you have seen, we have reached the highest level of margin in Production Systems since we have been reporting this division on the back of rolling in contract that in the backlog into revenue generation that are more accretive than the previous contract and at the results of not only the pricing environment that is more positive, but also the result of better supply chain and increased efficiency and use of additional technology that I think the entire team in Production System has been very good at selling to our customers. And I think, hence, the results now very specifically to the Subsea environment and the OneSubsea, we have been, a few months back, highlighting that our performance on Subsea is already in high teens as in previous or organic OneSubsea. The addition of the -- we expect to continue to and to recoup this margin and long-term continue to increase at this level and beyond. At Subsea, we will generate $100 million from year three on this OneSubsea joint venture going forward. So all in all, I believe that the element of our Production System portfolio are set to continue to not only grow, but also have incremental margin going forward. Hence, we expect the journey of margin expansion to continue next year and beyond. And the JV will be accretive to this.\nScott Gruber: Got it. And then turning to North America, a couple of years ago, you tilted your sales model towards more product sales and fewer boots on the ground. But now we're going through a wave of consolidation amongst your customers. We're seeing more privates taken out and now potentially a wave of larger mergers. How does that impact your strategy in North America?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think we have been very satisfied with the onset of our strategy and the deployment of strategy as we initiated it 4 years ago. I think we have turned out to be both appealing to the adoption of our technology products through partners, through this fit-for-basin and tech access model as well as our focused technology and focused fit-for-basin offering has been resonating with large public integrated company that have adopted our technology for performance purpose. As the market mature and as some consolidation will happen, we still believe that our technology performance, including impacts recovery. Digital will continue to resonate very well and will continue to be adopted very well by our customers. So we have an excellent exposure at this point to the public and integrated company. And I think this consolidation will give us opportunity to further showcase our technology, showcase our digital, showcase our fit-for-basin across both Production System and drilling well construction, in particular. And let's not forget that CCS is a new exploration world in NAM, this is also playing a critical role to our growth to through [indiscernible] performance and evolution portfolio is not Digital in that context. So we will continue to use tech access and fit-for-basin to be agile in this market to respond to the privates [ph] that are set to come back next year. And at the same time continue to engage with our larger customer and the customer that are at the top of our portfolio through technology and integration capabilities. So we are -- we believe we are set for success in this new mature market in NAM.\nScott Gruber: [Indiscernible]. Thank you.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we move on to Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan Chase. Please go ahead.\nArun Jayaram: Yes, good morning. I was wondering, Olivier, if you and Stephane could elaborate on kind of the margin performance in the core. In particular, you commented about pricing gains, particularly in Reservoir Performance. If you could highlight what you're seeing on pricing. And excluding, obviously, the impact from the close of the OneSubsea JV, would you expect similar margin expansion in the fourth quarter on a -- for the legacy SLB?\nOlivier Le Peuch: So let me start. I will let Stephane comment on the margin because I believe he provided some remarks to that effect. First, I believe that the core is benefiting from three things, in my opinion. It benefits from differentiated performance in the eyes of the customer, and hence, is benefiting by this creating an opportunity to secure market position and commands a pricing premium or favorable commercial terms to support this performance. Performance is recognized. Performance is critical in all projects, but in deepwater environment and is something that differentiates us and it's being recognized. So performance is a key factor. The second, I believe, is technology. Technology adoption has been accelerating. I think the target and the basket of technology we have set this year, including the transition technology where we set a target for $1 billion for the year, has already been achieved year-to-date. And hence, we see technology adoption as being unique in this environment, has differentiated again on performance and differentiated on creating insight and features and differentiate the value for customer and being recognized. And that is accretive to the margin and that drives our margin in the core. Finally, integration, and I will put digital into this, the ability to intertwine and add digital capability to our integration has delivered value. And you see that the Well Construction is benefiting from high-level margin that are very much helped by integration and digital as well as performance. Back to Reservoir Performance. Reservoir Performance had a very strong quarter on the back of result performance evaluation, which is used in exploration appraisal particularly where our differentiated technology portfolio has, again, been recognized with a premium. So that is what we are benefiting from. Technology, performance and integration with digital are driving a differentiated value proposition recognized with a pricing premium with our customers.\nStephane Biguet: And relating to margins, Arun, for Q4, yes, we do expect excluding the effect of the Aker Subsea contribution to continue expanding margins, particularly the digital and integration margins will definitely improve from accretive year-end digital sales so that will clearly be a tailwind. And then we will have probably improved margins, I'd say, across the other divisions, particularly in Production Systems where we have typically year-end sales that bring good incrementals. So yes, continuous margin expansion, excluding the JV in Q4.\nOlivier Le Peuch: And you could expect this to carry on in 2024 as we believe the attribute of differentiation, as I outlined before, and the favorable environment which we are operating partly internationally will continue to support margin expansion for the core.\nArun Jayaram: Great. My follow-up, Stephane, $1 billion of free cash flow generation in 3Q. Any thoughts on what could impact free cash flow in 4Q, just given working capital and just the OneSubsea JV? Just any things to flag?\nStephane Biguet: Sure, sure. So first, we are actually quite pleased with our free cash flow performance so far this year. It's indeed the second quarter in a row where we generate about $1 billion free cash flow. And it's really a combination, of course, of higher EBITDA, but also discipline in capital investments and an improved working capital performance quarter-after-quarter. So relating to Q4, we typically see a strong end of the year as it relates to free cash flow. So we are hoping that it will be the case this year as well. There are always moving targets based on customer collections. It's the main variability. But in general, we expect a strong free cash flow performance as we close the year.\nArun Jayaram: All right. Thanks gentlemen. \nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we move on to Marc Bianchi with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nMarc Bianchi: Hi. Thank you.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Good morning, Marc.\nMarc Bianchi: Good morning. You previously discussed an expectation for directionally $1.5 billion of EBITDA improvement in 2024. I'm curious what the underlying assumption for the JV is here, just so we can get a sense of how it's doing versus the what appears to be the fourth quarter run rate here.\nOlivier Le Peuch: I don't think we will, at this point, comment specifically on next year. I think it's -- directionally, I think it's an indication that we gave. I think the market, as it stands today, we have under a scenario of international growth momentum and also North America coming to a year-on-year growth activity. I think we see a scenario by which indeed this guidance we gave on this scenario we outlined will materialize. But I will not go into the detail at this point until our Q4 conference call in January and until we have time to triangulate some of our expectations with the customer engagement. We will come back with more detail, including the contribution we expect for the JV Subsea at that time.\nMarc Bianchi: Okay. Thank you. The -- another question on offshore, but specifically related to exploration. I think you earlier said that you expect 20% type growth in '23. I'm curious how that's playing out. And then can you remind us how large exploration is for SLB?\nOlivier Le Peuch: We don't comment on exploration because exploration, I think, is an -- as a subset of market segmentation, touch many aspects, I think, primarily Reservoir Performance, but also digital, some of them are integration and obviously, some components of some PS and Well Construction. So all in all, we believe that the exploration appraisal market has been aligned with the international growth this year and I think has been an element of offshore momentum that has been set this year. I think the results of -- and margin that we have seen from the performance are very much a reflection of that success. We are seeing success as well in our digital sales when it relate to data exploration. And we are seeing that the campaign of appraisal that have been made around Africa, particularly continuing to be sustained and in the search of confirming these finds and to develop FID in '24, '25. So we are positive about the exploration. We don't see a setback for customers on exploration, and we see that the breadth of exploration appraisal in offshore and in onshore market is much higher than it was a couple of years ago. It touched many geographies and basins from Southeast Asia to obviously, Middle East, Africa and North and South America. It's very broad and that is what I think is quite unique in this cycle.\nMarc Bianchi: Very good. Thank you very much.\nStephane Biguet: Thank you.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Marc.\nOperator: Our next question is from Luke Lemoine with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. One moment please. Mr. Lemoine, your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nLuke Lemoine: Thanks. Olivier, good morning. You've alluded the enhanced capabilities of the new OneSubsea and maybe to fine tune it a bit more. Could you talk about what you'd like to achieve on a commercial basis and maybe qualitatively on an operational level within the first year and maybe the next few years as well?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think first and foremost is to continue to satisfy fully the customer base and the backlog that we have, respectively, from Aker Solutions, from the organic OneSubsea secured in the last 18 months. And I think execution will be the first priority, first and foremost, to make sure the performance by joining team would not be affected. And I think we have been reassured from the engagement that our team that this is the case. I think next, I believe that what we want to achieve is to demonstrate for every customers that we have in the portfolio today that the combination of our engineering, new technology portfolio, a broader portfolio and integration capability that SLB brings with Subsea 7 and the rest of the SLB portfolio is differentiated and will add value to all the backlog that we have. And third and maybe the most interesting and the most exciting part that we are seeing is that customer at the onset of this announcement have come to us for asking partnership to be explored so that we can unlock economics, we can unlock recovery, and we can accelerate the path to decarbonization of deepwater operation to you by the combining and using and leveraging the full portfolio we have. So I would say performance and execution. I would say, sell up and integration capability for technology. And finally, this partnership model that I believe will be defining the new era for Subsea.\nLuke Lemoine: All right. Thanks, Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we go to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNeil Mehta: Yes, thank you. I had a couple of geography questions. The first is around North America, recognizing it's a smaller part of the growth driver of the business. But what are you seeing real time in this market? And do you think we're in a bottoming phase as we move into 2024?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yes. Great question, Neil. I think indeed, our hypothesis for the way forward and [indiscernible] specifically discuss the U.S. land activity. The apologies we have is that by the combination of the gas price, creating a little bit of a pull on supply and a pull on activity on gas as well as the favorable oil commodity price. We create a pull on the private, E&P privates coming back into this market, the magnitude of which is, at this point, difficult to judge. And I think there are plenty of scenarios and it will be a little bit of the swing factor, more opinion in the 2024 planning. Yes, we believe that the trough is beyond us, so it's about, at this point, and we see incremental from H2 of this year in the U.S. market going forward, our biggest incremental gain. We will come back to that as we guide 2024. When it comes to North America offshore, I think here from Canada to Gulf of Mexico, we see a robust and steady activity going forward. And we see that will continue to benefit to our exposure, and the OneSubsea JV will continue to magnify this where we\u2019ve opportunity to do so. And we are very satisfied with our performance there. So I believe that the activity and the outlook is, if anything, steady and has a potential for upside in 2024.\nNeil Mehta: Thanks, Olivier. And then just a follow-up is on Russia. You put out a release a couple of months ago talking about how you continue to wind down the business, and our expectation is that's going to go to zero here. But just any update on where you stand there and any color you can give to the market? Thank you.\nOlivier Le Peuch: As you could find in today's key [ph] document that we are releasing, Russia revenue percent approximately 5% of our consolidated revenue year-to-date. And we expect it indeed to decline as a percentage but not to zero in 2024. And any guidance that we provide will always include the Russia effect and how we anticipate this to happen. This has always been built in our model and does not impact our financial guidance, as I said. And I remind you that we continue to ensure that our remaining presence in Russia meets and exceeds all international sanctions.\nNeil Mehta: That\u2019s great. Thanks, Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you.\nJames McDonald: Leah, do we have any further calls on the line?\nOperator: Yes, Mr. Hallead -- Kurt Hallead with Benchmark. You may go ahead.\nKurt Hallead: Hey, good morning, everybody.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Good morning.\nStephane Biguet: Good morning.\nKurt Hallead: Olivier, I'm kind of curious, just this week, it looks like the U.S. has agreed to lift sanctions on the export of Venezuelan oil products. I know that Venezuela had been a fairly large market for Schlumberger prior to the sanction dynamics, and I think you guys have maintained a presence there. So just kind of curious as to what you think the opportunity could be once the sanctions are lifted in terms of providing incremental revenue growth.\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think it's early stage. I don't think it's -- it will be appropriate to comment on the size of the opportunity. But surely, I think we have that historically very strong track record and set of capability in country that have been dominant since we had to shut down the operation. But as soon as and we get support from our partners-customers into this, we will be responding and as fast as we can with mobilizing resources and equipment that is over there to respond and participate to this opening. But it's too early to say and it's too early to give a guidance of any thoughts on the impact it will have, but its potential and its upside, if it comes, indeed.\nKurt Hallead: That's great. Thanks. And I've got a follow-up. Just I know you referenced you expect Digital revenue to grow to be about $3 billion by 2025. Just kind of curious as to what contribution you think AI will have in that growth and whether or not the adoption rate of AI among your customer base gives you even greater conviction of getting to that level.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yes, indeed. I think for making sure that we are all aligned, we quoted that we expect the revenue of digital to double from '21 to '25 and to reach approximately $3 billion by '25. And indeed, very much a component of what we call the new technology, digital portfolio includes our ability to unlock data insights through AI, the ability to create and imagine new workflow to AI into and to support a key element of digital operations like autonomous drilling through AI. And you will see very soon some announcement of industry first that have used automation and AI to enable this automation, to enable these new insights. So we are very positive about what AI can bring to this. We have a unique capability. We have domain AI capability embedded into our platform. We have better IQ as a partner with ready-to-go portfolio of routines and AI capability that have been recognized as best-in-class and allowing our customers to rapidly unlock and use AI and scale AI into their application. And we have, for the last 1.5 years, launched our INNOVATION FACTORI which are labs that we use to collaborate for customers, and we have six of them across the globe, where we collaborate and we have more than 100 projects already achieved with our customers through this INNOVATION FACTORI. So a great pickup, and you may have seen during at APEC, we announced an AI project that we have released with our partners in the Emirates to support AI capability with ADNOC. So it's all over the place. It's in [indiscernible], it's in planning, and it's an execution in digital operations to [indiscernible] So it's picking up, and it would indeed hopefully contribute and give us that opportunity in 2025.\nKurt Hallead: That\u2019s great. Thanks for the color.\nOlivier Le Peuch: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: And our last question will come from Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nRoger Read: Hey, thank you. Good morning.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Good morning.\nRoger Read: Olivier \u2026\nStephane Biguet: Good morning, Roger.\nRoger Read: I'd like to come to it from a margin standpoint. I mean, your margins are pretty fantastic here for certainly where we are in the cycle and everything like that. When we look back to the up cycle and there's still a ton of room to go, and I recognize this question may be premature relative to maybe an update when we are really looking more at '24. But what do you see as things that could lift margins from here? What do you see things that would restrain margins from reaching sort of max levels? Or what would we need to see in the market fundamentals to make a significant uplift from margins here?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I don't want to, first, put a ceiling on the max on the margin we can achieve. I think the future and the market outlook will detect that. But most importantly, our ability to execute, to continue to execute on our performance strategy will continue to define our ability to capture, enhance our margin, whatever the market conditions are. And I think this is what we have been achieving for the last 4 years. And I think, again, technology differentiation, integration capability, augmented by digital and performance on everything we deliver is what is getting our customers trust us to give us premium and give us favorable commercial condition and further growth potential by better share of their business allocation. So I think, again, we initiated and we telegraphed fairly well 3 years ago that we'll be initiating a margin expansion journey. We have been on that journey for the last 3 years from the trough of 2020. We committed to expand. And I think we have delivered on this commitment. Some of you were looking forward to see when we will cross the 25%. Some of -- some scenario we are putting this in 2025. We said we would likely be able to cross this before. It came slightly ahead of our expectation because I think I'm impressed by what our team is able to deliver. And yes, the market conditions are favorable, but we expect that the breadth, duration and the resiliency of the cycle will continue. The effect of Middle East and offshore will continue to give us a favorable backdrop so that this strategy will continue to support margin expansion. So that's our belief. And again, I don't want to put a ceiling, I don't want to put a max, but I will continue to push my team to continue to extract the best and seize the cycle, as we say.\nRoger Read: Sounds good. Good luck with everything and thank you.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Roger.\nStephane Biguet: Thank you very much.\nOperator: And I will turn the conference back over to the Schlumberger management team for closing remarks.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Leah. Ladies and gentlemen, as we conclude today's call, I would like to leave you with the following takeaways. First, the ongoing oil and gas cycle continues to display the unique attributes of breadth, resilience and durability that closely align with our business strategy. In this environment, unparalleled offerings in our core, our ability to enhance value through digital and our investments in New Energy have us positioned during both today and tomorrow. Second, our international reach continued to drive our financial performance. As investment momentum has shifted internationally and offshore, our business is well positioned for sustained growth and will be further supported by our OneSubsea joint venture. Third, after posting an impressive 9-month year-to-date performance and with visibility into the fourth quarter and 2024, we remain confident in our full year and through-cycle financial targets. This is an exciting time for the energy industry, and SLB is ideally positioned for success across all time horizons. This is an excellent environment to continue delivering value to our shareholders. I remain fully confident in our strategy and look forward to another successful quarter and close to the year. With that, we will conclude our call this morning. Thank you, and good day everyone.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Stephane Biguet",
            "content": "Thank you, Olivier and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Third quarter earnings per share was $0.78. This represents an increase of $0.06 sequentially and $0.15 when compared to the third quarter of last year. We did not record any charges or credits during any of those periods. Overall, our third quarter revenue of $8.3 billion increased 3% sequentially. International sequential revenue growth of 5% was led by the Middle East and Asia, which increased 8% while North America revenue decreased 6%. Sequentially, pre-tax segment operating margin increased 73 basis points, which resulted in incremental margins of 48% largely due to the high-quality international revenue. Company-wide adjusted EBITDA margin for the third quarter reached 25%, the highest level since 2015. On a year-on-year basis, third quarter revenue increased 11% as international revenue grew 12%, while North America revenue increased 6%. The strong international performance was led by broad-based growth across the Middle East and Asia and offshore markets. Let me now go through the third quarter results for each division. Third quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $982 million increased 4% sequentially with margins decreasing 2 percentage points to 32%. The sequential revenue growth was primarily driven by increased APS revenue and increased digital revenue, including higher sales of exploration data licenses. Margins declined sequentially as lower profitability in APS more than offset improved digital margins. Reservoir Performance revenue of $51.7 billion increased 2% sequentially while margins improved 190 basis points to 20.5%. These increases were due to strong international growth, a favorable technology mix and improved pricing. Well Construction revenue of $3.4 billion increased 2% sequentially led by strong growth in the Middle East and Asia which was partially offset by lower revenue in North America. Margins of 22.1% increased 38 basis points driven by the international markets. Finally, Production Systems revenue of $2.4 billion increased 2% sequentially as international revenue increased 7% led by the Middle East and Asia and Latin America. North America revenue decreased by 8% due to lower subsea activity. Margins expanded 147 basis points to 13.5% representing the highest margin since we began reporting results for the division. This expansion was primarily driven by higher sales of completions, artificial lift and surface production systems as well as pricing improvements. Now turning to our liquidity. During the quarter, we generated $1.7 billion of cash flow from operations and free cash flow of just over $1 billion. As a result of this strong cash flow performance, our net debt reduced sequentially by $731 million to $9.4 billion. Our net debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA leverage ratio of 1.2 is at its lowest level since 2015. Capital investments, inclusive of CapEx and investments in APS projects and exploration data, were $640 million in the third quarter. For the full year, we are still expecting capital investments to be approximately $2.5 million to $2.6 billion. We repurchased 2.6 million shares of our stock during the quarter for a total purchase price of $151million. We continue to target to return $2 billion to our shareholders this year between dividends and stock buybacks. Before closing, I would like to add some color to the Q4 outlook that Olivier just provided. We are expecting sequential fourth quarter revenue growth to be in the high-single digits with pre-tax margins remaining at the same high-level we achieved in the third quarter. As Olivier highlighted, this outlook includes the contribution from the recently acquired Aker subsea business, which will be consolidated under our Production Systems division starting in the fourth quarter. The Aker subsea business is expected to contribute approximately $400 million to $500 million of incremental revenue in the fourth quarter with pre-tax operating margins in the low teens. Therefore, excluding the effects of the acquired Aker subsea business, SLB's fourth quarter sequential revenue growth is expected to be similar to the sequential revenue growth we experienced in the third quarter. SLB's organic pre-tax operating margin, again excluding the effects of the acquired Aker business, is expected to continue expanding sequentially. After considering the impact of below the line items relating to this joint venture such as amortization of intangibles, taxes, and non-controlling interest, this transaction is expected to be slightly accretive to our fourth quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits. In closing, we are very excited about the prospects of this venture, which strengthens our offshore portfolio and has the potential to deliver more than $100 million of net annual synergies starting year three after closing. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier. Good morning, James. So, thanks, James. So, look, most of our revenue is built in U.S dollars. But indeed in a few countries, it's partially not the case for. So for some of us, we indeed had an unfavorable impact of the U.S dollar strengthening against local currencies. And that was both sequentially and year-on-year. I prefer I'm not giving you a specific amount as we have contractual adjustment clauses that come and offset the negative effect at least partially, but yes the revenue would have been slightly higher without that. And the last point here to remember is a lot of our cost as well are expressed in local currency. So we have a natural hedge on this. And the net impact on the earnings is quite marginally, it's limited. And relating to margins, Arun, for Q4, yes, we do expect excluding the effect of the Aker Subsea contribution to continue expanding margins, particularly the digital and integration margins will definitely improve from accretive year-end digital sales so that will clearly be a tailwind. And then we will have probably improved margins, I'd say, across the other divisions, particularly in Production Systems where we have typically year-end sales that bring good incrementals. So yes, continuous margin expansion, excluding the JV in Q4. Sure, sure. So first, we are actually quite pleased with our free cash flow performance so far this year. It's indeed the second quarter in a row where we generate about $1 billion free cash flow. And it's really a combination, of course, of higher EBITDA, but also discipline in capital investments and an improved working capital performance quarter-after-quarter. So relating to Q4, we typically see a strong end of the year as it relates to free cash flow. So we are hoping that it will be the case this year as well. There are always moving targets based on customer collections. It's the main variability. But in general, we expect a strong free cash flow performance as we close the year. Thank you. Good morning. Good morning, Roger. Thank you very much."

            "name": "Olivier Le Peuch",
            "content": "Thank you, James. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on the call today. In my remarks this morning, I will begin by reviewing the third quarter financial results we represented in today's earnings release. Then I will discuss the progress we are achieving across our three engines of growth and the macro environment supporting that. And finally, I will share our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year. Stephane will then provide more details on our financial results, and we will open the line to your questions. Our third quarter results are built upon the positive momentum we established in the first half of the year and firmly position us to achieve our full year financial ambitions. We continued to grow revenue and adjusted EBITDA both sequentially and year-on-year, and we generated free cash flow of $1 billion for the second consecutive quarter. Internationally, we continued to seize the cycle. We achieved our highest international revenue quarter since 2015 by growing revenue in this market for the ninth consecutive quarter year-on- year. This was particularly visible in the Middle East & Asia, where we posted 22% year-on-year revenue growth, led by significant growth in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, and Egypt. Our strong international activity was further augmented by resilient investment in the offshore markets, notably in Africa, Brazil, and Scandinavia. Offshore continues to offer many opportunities for our business, and I will shortly discuss how the recent closing of our OneSubsea Joint Venture with Aker Solutions and Subsea7 will help us to expand our footprint in the market moving forward. And in North America, although revenue decreased sequentially due to lower activity, we continued to grow year-on-year, outperforming the rig count. Once again, our focus on the quality of our revenue combined with the differentiated value we deliver through technology drove margin expansion. Our EBITDA margin reached a new cycle high of 25% and our pre-tax segment operating margin expanded for the 11th consecutive quarter year-on-year. These are very positive results and I want to thank the entire SLB team for delivering this strong performance. Next, I would like to share some updates about our progress across our three engines of growth: Core, Digital, and New Energy. Let me begin with the Core. The oil and gas sector continues to benefit from a broad, durable, and resilient multiyear growth cycle that is being supported by long-cycle developments, production capacity expansions, exploration and appraisal, and the recognition of gas as a critical fuel source for the energy transition. These market fundamentals remain very compelling for our Core business, which has grown 22% year-to-date and has materially expanded margins. This strong performance is being driven by the diversity of our portfolio, our industry leading technology, and our unique integration capabilities. Reservoir Performance achieved exceptional results with stronger evaluation activity; Production Systems achieved its highest level of margins in the cycle led by Subsea, Surface, and Artificial Lift; and Well Construction maintained impressive results through new technology innovations and differentiated performance. All in all, this was a very strong quarter across our Core divisions. The supportive macro environment is also leading operators to make long cycle investments offshore, where advances in efficiency have significantly improved project economics. We have visibility into FIDs extending well beyond 2025, and there couldn't be a better time to join forces with Aker Solutions and Subsea7 to drive a new era for subsea. Today, SLB is recognized for its unique ability to handle large, complex, and fully integrated offshore projects from subsurface development to midstream processing. Through our OneSubsea joint venture we will further enhance this offering by bringing new levels of technology and partnership to the market. Together, our companies are the clear leader in subsea multiphase boosting and subsea gas compression, and we will provide electrification and digital solutions to further enhance the business. This partnership approach will also create a more flexible customer offering through scale, increased capacity, and life of field services. Collectively, this will drive meaningful change to subsea asset performance as we partner with customers to help them unlock their reserves, drive efficiency, reduce cycle times, and reduce emissions in the deepwater market. Now, let me turn to Digital. On our call last quarter, I shared an update on the emerging digital trends shaping the industry. These included the adoption of cloud computing, the power of data and AI at scale, and digital operations gaining maturity. At a recent investor conference, I discussed how SLB is capitalizing on this opportunity with our platform strategy comprising of a workflow platform that serves as the backbone for our customers' planning and operations and our data and AI platform that unlocks data at scale for digital transformation. Today, we are seeing increased digital adoption across the industry. Delfi continued its year-over-year growth momentum with a 49% increase in users and an 89 -- 86% increase in compute hours compared to the third quarter last year. Additionally, our customers are embracing our connected and autonomous drilling solutions, with 1.9 million feet of automated drilling completed in the third quarter, an increase of 60% year-over-year. As a result, SLB's platforms representing our new digital technology offering, sustained growth at a CAGR rate of about 60%. The benefit of these technologies is clear, and you can see this illustrated in our earnings press release this morning, with our Shell/AWS collaborative agreement and the Kuwait Energy Basra Limited digital oilfield contract serving as just two recent examples of customers choosing SLB Digital technology to reimagine their workflows across the E&P value chain. And finally, let me quickly discuss some of the exciting opportunities in our New Energy business and Transition Technologies portfolio. As we address the energy trilemma, our industry has an imperative to decarbonizes operations. Two of the most immediate opportunities to do this are reducing methane emissions and scaling CCUS as a solution for mitigating climate change. Regarding methane, we have opportunities to address fugitive methane and flaring through better monitoring and leak detection. A few weeks ago, we launched a new IoT enabled methane point instrument for continuous monitoring that seamlessly connects to our methane digital platform for insights and analysis, eliminating the need for intermittent site visits and enabling operators to quickly scale up across their operations. This and other solutions are available today to help clients abate their methane emissions. And in CCUS, momentum is building across the industry, both in oil and gas as well as in other hard-to-abate sectors. SLB is actively involved in more than 20 CCUS projects globally and we are investing in capture technology, as underscored by the partnership with TDA Research-highlighted in our earnings release. Overall, we are pleased with our pipeline of technology and projects, and we have confidence that by establishing ourselves as a leader in this space, we will create yet another avenue for diversified long-term growth. Now, I will turn to our outlook for the fourth quarter and the full year. In the fourth quarter, we expect continued sequential revenue growth driven by year-end Digital sales and seasonal product and equipment sales in Production Systems. The quarter will also reflect the results of the OneSubsea joint venture. As a result, we expect overall sequential revenue growth to be in the high-single digits. With our continued focus on the quality of revenue, harnessing operating leverage, and further technology adoption, we expect to maintain global pre-tax segment operating and EBITDA margins at their highest levels in the cycle, in line with our third quarter performance. Stephane will provide additional color on the net contribution of the OneSubsea joint venture on our fourth quarter guidance. Turning to the full year, we expect to achieve the financial ambitions we shared back in January. Excluding the effects of the OneSubsea joint venture, we expect to conclude the year by increasing revenue more than 15% and growing EBITDA in the mid-20s, with recent North American headwinds being more than offset by strong international growth. With these strong full year results, we will remain well positioned to continue returning value to our shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Stephane. Thank you, Stephane. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now open the line for your questions. Leah, if you may open the lines. Good morning. No, thank you, James. I hope everybody could catch your question right into Middle East. Indeed, I have the privilege to be there for about a weekend and not only went to the conference and met a lot of customers in the region, but also had the benefit to go to operation in Saudi and visit the customer in south over there. So great insights. Needless to say that this is clearly the largest investment cycle, its clean on the way. The momentum is set. It's not about the concept and I think the sentiment across [indiscernible] shall be positive. Leah, there's a noise on the ... Thank you. So if I were to characterize attributes, I think breadth, resilience, durability that we have characterized for the full cycle, I think are very much in full display in Middle East. I think the Durability 27 is the target for capital expansion. Breadth is not only old, but it's also gas as a driver for general vision or gas consumption and energy exports. Its offshore and onshore, its conventional and unconventional, and goes beyond one or two country that are very well known into Kuwait, into Iraq, into Egypt and more. And it's clearly decoupled from some of the short-term uncertainty. So it's all made about of long-term contract from the re-contracting to the service contract. And we are clear beneficiary of this situation. We have a unique footprint in the region. And indeed, we see that this will continue to support growth in the years to come for SLB. And this year, as stated before, we will record a record revenue in the region. And we will continue to grow and use this to be accretive to international growth and accretive to our international margin and the company. A great outlook in essence. Great question, Dave. And I think indeed, we have been working on this. I'm very, very proud and I believe that the timing couldn't be better that closing this now as the onset of the offshore growth and the long duration that we see with SLB beyond 2025. So, if I had to take three key words, I would say technology fit, integration capability and scale are the three elements that I think resonate very well and create value for customers. Technology, whether we are enhancing and getting with this addition of a comprehensive portfolio that is fit to every deeper market that exists and that includes further capability, complimentary and capability in Subsea processing and also in own vehicles [ph] that complete the portfolio and allow us to fully participate and being differentiated in every basin, in every deepwater condition in the world. Integration, we bring and we keep our unique subsurface reservoir to processing capability that we had already in OneSubsea. But we are enhancing it with a larger and a very competent team running us for from a acquisition and engineering capability. So that we can take any deeper prospect and help customers and collaborate to get the best outcome and we are getting our Subsea7 partner to joining and to be aligned with making this a success, when and as we are required to deliver as integrated with us. So all in all, this is what the value brings in integration. Scale. Scale give us manufacturing footprint that give us flexibility, and the ability to respond fast and to respond to customer need everywhere and give us the unique life of field with the largest install base of subsidiary, where we will use digital ,we will use integration capability with our performance to provide further integration and further life of field and looking pollution recovery, if you like, long-term. So customer feedback is excellent at the onset. I think the customer really appreciate and recognize the recovery potential, the comprehensive technology portfolio, the lower emission, the digital and the integration capability. Culture. I think we have discovered throughout this engagement, that actually the culture are very much aligned. And I think we have had a day one set of events last week or 2 weeks ago that we're really our planning are aligned we are and our complementary culture and portfolio are to go into this. So I'm very optimistic, very positive and customer feedback is extremely positive to onboard this. And you may have seen the [indiscernible] in my opinion, which is a precursor, in our opinion, is what we can do to partner with our customers and to help unlock the future of subsea reserves and to impact their recovery, their efficiency and economics and their lower carbon outlook. Yes. I think we -- thank you, James (sic) [David]. I think we continue to be very positive about the digital business and its adoption with our customers. You will continue to see announcement being made from workflow and adoption for customers and also more and more announcement of digital operation, edge, AI, as you have seen many of them into our press release earlier today. So we are very satisfied with the momentum. And it's going, it's going fairly well. I think you are seeing that we have quoted that the new technology digital portfolio from workflows to operation is growing at a CAGR of about 60%. And I think this is in line with what we expected. And this is on top of the baseline that includes the legacy software maintenance and all the services, including the data sales that we do, that is somehow offsetting some of this, but still represents total growth. So we expect this growth to be very visible into the fourth quarter as we typically have a year-end sales effect. And we continue -- we expect this to continue and accelerate actually next year. Good morning. I think, Scott, simply said, we believe that we'll continue to have -- continue our journey of margin expansion. As you have seen, we have reached the highest level of margin in Production Systems since we have been reporting this division on the back of rolling in contract that in the backlog into revenue generation that are more accretive than the previous contract and at the results of not only the pricing environment that is more positive, but also the result of better supply chain and increased efficiency and use of additional technology that I think the entire team in Production System has been very good at selling to our customers. And I think, hence, the results now very specifically to the Subsea environment and the OneSubsea, we have been, a few months back, highlighting that our performance on Subsea is already in high teens as in previous or organic OneSubsea. The addition of the -- we expect to continue to and to recoup this margin and long-term continue to increase at this level and beyond. At Subsea, we will generate $100 million from year three on this OneSubsea joint venture going forward. So all in all, I believe that the element of our Production System portfolio are set to continue to not only grow, but also have incremental margin going forward. Hence, we expect the journey of margin expansion to continue next year and beyond. And the JV will be accretive to this. I think we have been very satisfied with the onset of our strategy and the deployment of strategy as we initiated it 4 years ago. I think we have turned out to be both appealing to the adoption of our technology products through partners, through this fit-for-basin and tech access model as well as our focused technology and focused fit-for-basin offering has been resonating with large public integrated company that have adopted our technology for performance purpose. As the market mature and as some consolidation will happen, we still believe that our technology performance, including impacts recovery. Digital will continue to resonate very well and will continue to be adopted very well by our customers. So we have an excellent exposure at this point to the public and integrated company. And I think this consolidation will give us opportunity to further showcase our technology, showcase our digital, showcase our fit-for-basin across both Production System and drilling well construction, in particular. And let's not forget that CCS is a new exploration world in NAM, this is also playing a critical role to our growth to through [indiscernible] performance and evolution portfolio is not Digital in that context. So we will continue to use tech access and fit-for-basin to be agile in this market to respond to the privates [ph] that are set to come back next year. And at the same time continue to engage with our larger customer and the customer that are at the top of our portfolio through technology and integration capabilities. So we are -- we believe we are set for success in this new mature market in NAM. Thank you. So let me start. I will let Stephane comment on the margin because I believe he provided some remarks to that effect. First, I believe that the core is benefiting from three things, in my opinion. It benefits from differentiated performance in the eyes of the customer, and hence, is benefiting by this creating an opportunity to secure market position and commands a pricing premium or favorable commercial terms to support this performance. Performance is recognized. Performance is critical in all projects, but in deepwater environment and is something that differentiates us and it's being recognized. So performance is a key factor. The second, I believe, is technology. Technology adoption has been accelerating. I think the target and the basket of technology we have set this year, including the transition technology where we set a target for $1 billion for the year, has already been achieved year-to-date. And hence, we see technology adoption as being unique in this environment, has differentiated again on performance and differentiated on creating insight and features and differentiate the value for customer and being recognized. And that is accretive to the margin and that drives our margin in the core. Finally, integration, and I will put digital into this, the ability to intertwine and add digital capability to our integration has delivered value. And you see that the Well Construction is benefiting from high-level margin that are very much helped by integration and digital as well as performance. Back to Reservoir Performance. Reservoir Performance had a very strong quarter on the back of result performance evaluation, which is used in exploration appraisal particularly where our differentiated technology portfolio has, again, been recognized with a premium. So that is what we are benefiting from. Technology, performance and integration with digital are driving a differentiated value proposition recognized with a pricing premium with our customers. And you could expect this to carry on in 2024 as we believe the attribute of differentiation, as I outlined before, and the favorable environment which we are operating partly internationally will continue to support margin expansion for the core. Thank you. Good morning, Marc. I don't think we will, at this point, comment specifically on next year. I think it's -- directionally, I think it's an indication that we gave. I think the market, as it stands today, we have under a scenario of international growth momentum and also North America coming to a year-on-year growth activity. I think we see a scenario by which indeed this guidance we gave on this scenario we outlined will materialize. But I will not go into the detail at this point until our Q4 conference call in January and until we have time to triangulate some of our expectations with the customer engagement. We will come back with more detail, including the contribution we expect for the JV Subsea at that time. We don't comment on exploration because exploration, I think, is an -- as a subset of market segmentation, touch many aspects, I think, primarily Reservoir Performance, but also digital, some of them are integration and obviously, some components of some PS and Well Construction. So all in all, we believe that the exploration appraisal market has been aligned with the international growth this year and I think has been an element of offshore momentum that has been set this year. I think the results of -- and margin that we have seen from the performance are very much a reflection of that success. We are seeing success as well in our digital sales when it relate to data exploration. And we are seeing that the campaign of appraisal that have been made around Africa, particularly continuing to be sustained and in the search of confirming these finds and to develop FID in '24, '25. So we are positive about the exploration. We don't see a setback for customers on exploration, and we see that the breadth of exploration appraisal in offshore and in onshore market is much higher than it was a couple of years ago. It touched many geographies and basins from Southeast Asia to obviously, Middle East, Africa and North and South America. It's very broad and that is what I think is quite unique in this cycle. Thank you, Marc. I think first and foremost is to continue to satisfy fully the customer base and the backlog that we have, respectively, from Aker Solutions, from the organic OneSubsea secured in the last 18 months. And I think execution will be the first priority, first and foremost, to make sure the performance by joining team would not be affected. And I think we have been reassured from the engagement that our team that this is the case. I think next, I believe that what we want to achieve is to demonstrate for every customers that we have in the portfolio today that the combination of our engineering, new technology portfolio, a broader portfolio and integration capability that SLB brings with Subsea 7 and the rest of the SLB portfolio is differentiated and will add value to all the backlog that we have. And third and maybe the most interesting and the most exciting part that we are seeing is that customer at the onset of this announcement have come to us for asking partnership to be explored so that we can unlock economics, we can unlock recovery, and we can accelerate the path to decarbonization of deepwater operation to you by the combining and using and leveraging the full portfolio we have. So I would say performance and execution. I would say, sell up and integration capability for technology. And finally, this partnership model that I believe will be defining the new era for Subsea. Thank you. Yes. Great question, Neil. I think indeed, our hypothesis for the way forward and [indiscernible] specifically discuss the U.S. land activity. The apologies we have is that by the combination of the gas price, creating a little bit of a pull on supply and a pull on activity on gas as well as the favorable oil commodity price. We create a pull on the private, E&P privates coming back into this market, the magnitude of which is, at this point, difficult to judge. And I think there are plenty of scenarios and it will be a little bit of the swing factor, more opinion in the 2024 planning. Yes, we believe that the trough is beyond us, so it's about, at this point, and we see incremental from H2 of this year in the U.S. market going forward, our biggest incremental gain. We will come back to that as we guide 2024. When it comes to North America offshore, I think here from Canada to Gulf of Mexico, we see a robust and steady activity going forward. And we see that will continue to benefit to our exposure, and the OneSubsea JV will continue to magnify this where we've opportunity to do so. And we are very satisfied with our performance there. So I believe that the activity and the outlook is, if anything, steady and has a potential for upside in 2024. As you could find in today's key [ph] document that we are releasing, Russia revenue percent approximately 5% of our consolidated revenue year-to-date. And we expect it indeed to decline as a percentage but not to zero in 2024. And any guidance that we provide will always include the Russia effect and how we anticipate this to happen. This has always been built in our model and does not impact our financial guidance, as I said. And I remind you that we continue to ensure that our remaining presence in Russia meets and exceeds all international sanctions. Thank you. Good morning. I think it's early stage. I don't think it's -- it will be appropriate to comment on the size of the opportunity. But surely, I think we have that historically very strong track record and set of capability in country that have been dominant since we had to shut down the operation. But as soon as and we get support from our partners-customers into this, we will be responding and as fast as we can with mobilizing resources and equipment that is over there to respond and participate to this opening. But it's too early to say and it's too early to give a guidance of any thoughts on the impact it will have, but its potential and its upside, if it comes, indeed. Yes, indeed. I think for making sure that we are all aligned, we quoted that we expect the revenue of digital to double from '21 to '25 and to reach approximately $3 billion by '25. And indeed, very much a component of what we call the new technology, digital portfolio includes our ability to unlock data insights through AI, the ability to create and imagine new workflow to AI into and to support a key element of digital operations like autonomous drilling through AI. And you will see very soon some announcement of industry first that have used automation and AI to enable this automation, to enable these new insights. So we are very positive about what AI can bring to this. We have a unique capability. We have domain AI capability embedded into our platform. We have better IQ as a partner with ready-to-go portfolio of routines and AI capability that have been recognized as best-in-class and allowing our customers to rapidly unlock and use AI and scale AI into their application. And we have, for the last 1.5 years, launched our INNOVATION FACTORI which are labs that we use to collaborate for customers, and we have six of them across the globe, where we collaborate and we have more than 100 projects already achieved with our customers through this INNOVATION FACTORI. So a great pickup, and you may have seen during at APEC, we announced an AI project that we have released with our partners in the Emirates to support AI capability with ADNOC. So it's all over the place. It's in [indiscernible], it's in planning, and it's an execution in digital operations to [indiscernible] So it's picking up, and it would indeed hopefully contribute and give us that opportunity in 2025. You're welcome. Good morning. I don't want to, first, put a ceiling on the max on the margin we can achieve. I think the future and the market outlook will detect that. But most importantly, our ability to execute, to continue to execute on our performance strategy will continue to define our ability to capture, enhance our margin, whatever the market conditions are. And I think this is what we have been achieving for the last 4 years. And I think, again, technology differentiation, integration capability, augmented by digital and performance on everything we deliver is what is getting our customers trust us to give us premium and give us favorable commercial condition and further growth potential by better share of their business allocation. So I think, again, we initiated and we telegraphed fairly well 3 years ago that we'll be initiating a margin expansion journey. We have been on that journey for the last 3 years from the trough of 2020. We committed to expand. And I think we have delivered on this commitment. Some of you were looking forward to see when we will cross the 25%. Some of -- some scenario we are putting this in 2025. We said we would likely be able to cross this before. It came slightly ahead of our expectation because I think I'm impressed by what our team is able to deliver. And yes, the market conditions are favorable, but we expect that the breadth, duration and the resiliency of the cycle will continue. The effect of Middle East and offshore will continue to give us a favorable backdrop so that this strategy will continue to support margin expansion. So that's our belief. And again, I don't want to put a ceiling, I don't want to put a max, but I will continue to push my team to continue to extract the best and seize the cycle, as we say. Thank you, Roger. Thank you, Leah. Ladies and gentlemen, as we conclude today's call, I would like to leave you with the following takeaways. First, the ongoing oil and gas cycle continues to display the unique attributes of breadth, resilience and durability that closely align with our business strategy. In this environment, unparalleled offerings in our core, our ability to enhance value through digital and our investments in New Energy have us positioned during both today and tomorrow. Second, our international reach continued to drive our financial performance. As investment momentum has shifted internationally and offshore, our business is well positioned for sustained growth and will be further supported by our OneSubsea joint venture. Third, after posting an impressive 9-month year-to-date performance and with visibility into the fourth quarter and 2024, we remain confident in our full year and through-cycle financial targets. This is an exciting time for the energy industry, and SLB is ideally positioned for success across all time horizons. This is an excellent environment to continue delivering value to our shareholders. I remain fully confident in our strategy and look forward to another successful quarter and close to the year. With that, we will conclude our call this morning. Thank you, and good day everyone."

Later, there will be an opportunity for your questions. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the SVP of Investor Relations and Industry Affairs, James McDonald. Please go ahead.\nJames McDonald: Thank you, Leah. Good morning, and welcome to the SLB second quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Today's call is being hosted from Paris, France, following our Board meeting, held earlier this week. Joining us on the call are Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Executive Officer; and Stephane Biguet, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind all participants that some of the statements we will be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and our other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our second quarter press release, which is on our website. With that, I will turn the call over to Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, James. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on the call today. In my prepared remarks, I will cover three topics. I will first review a few of our financial highlights from the quarter. Next, I will discuss the positive momentum we are seeing in the international and offshore markets. And third, I will share the exciting progress we are making in digital before concluding with our outlook for the third quarter and the full-year. Stephane will then provide more details on our financial results, and we will open for your questions. Our second quarter results continue to demonstrate the strength of our portfolio and our strategic positioning in the most attractive, accretive, and resilient markets globally. This is translating to financial performance, and we closed the first half of the year with solid growth across revenue, earnings per share, free cash flow, and expanded EBITDA and pre-tax segment operating margins. International revenue continued its strong growth momentum, increasing 21% year-on-year as we captured broad growth across all divisions and geographic areas. Second quarter revenue increased by more than 20% year-on-year in 14 of our 25 international GeoUnits. Most notably, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Mexico, Guyana, Brazil, Angola, Caspian, and India all grew more than 30% over this period. This drove our highest year-on-year international incremental operating margin over the last three years, and it underscores the breadth of our portfolio that I continue to emphasize. SLB's global reach shields us from regional fluctuations, as we have recently seen in North America, and give us the ability to seize opportunities wherever they arise. This is a true differentiator for our business and positions us for long-term outperformance. Following the remarks I shared in our earnings release this morning, I would like to reflect on a few notable highlights from the quarter. The broad growth characterizing this upcycle continues. Internationally, this was pervasive, and we were very pleased to see all divisions and geographies grow revenue and expand margins sequentially. In North America, we continued to increase our revenue, highlighting our agility across the land markets and the expanded activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, solidly outperforming the rig count. Our focus on the quality of our revenue continues to support our margins. Sequentially, we expanded our pretax segment operating margin. This was fueled by our strong international operating leverage, increased technology adoption, and positive pricing trends that stemmed from inflation-driven contract adjustments and tight service capacity. And with higher earnings and improved working capital, our sequential cash flow from operations grew considerably, and we generated free cash flow of nearly $1 billion during the quarter. I want to thank the entire SLB team for their hard work and exceptional performance delivering value for our customers and our shareholders throughout the quarter. Now, let me take a moment to touch on the macro environment. As we have projected for the past few quarters, the international and offshore markets continue to exhibit strong growth as North America has moderated. This is playing to the strengths of our business, as international revenue represents nearly 80% of our global portfolio, and offshore comprises nearly half of that. As the growth rate shifts further toward international, these market conditions are driving the breadth, resilience, and durability of this upcycle and creating new opportunities for our business. Let me describe where this is taking place. In the international markets, the investment momentum of the past few years is accelerating. This is supported by resilient long-cycle developments in Guyana, Brazil, Norway, and Turkey; production capacity expansions in the Middle East, notably in Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Qatar; the return of exploration and appraisal across Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean; and the recognition of gas as a critical fuel source for energy security and the energy transition. In the Middle East, this is resulting in record levels of upstream investment. From 2023 to 2025, Saudi Arabia is expected to allocate nearly $100 billion to upstream oil and gas capital expenditure, a 60% increase compared to the previous three years, as they invest to attain a maximum sustained production capacity of 13 million barrels per day by 2027. Several other countries in the region have also announced material increases in capital expenditures that extend beyond 2025. Furthermore, we continue to witness a broad resurgence in offshore driven by energy security and regionalization. Operators all over the world are making large-scale commitments to hasten discovery, accelerate development times, and increase the productivity of their assets. This is resulting in increased infill and tie back activity in mature basins, new development projects both in oil and gas, and support for new exploration. With this backdrop, we anticipate more than $500 billion in global FIDs between 2022 and 2025, with more than $200 billion attributable to deepwater. This reflects an increase of nearly 90% when compared to 2016-2019. These FID investments are global taking place in more than 30 countries, and we are seeing the results with new projects in offshore basins across the world. This is reflected in the many contract awards highlighted in the earnings press release, notably in Mexico, Brazil, and Turkey. These contracts, in addition to many others, are building a strong foundation of activity outlook decoupled from short-term commodity price volatility. Moving forward, we expect further growth to be led by accelerating activity in Well Construction, new opportunities for Reservoir Performance in exploration and appraisal, expansion for Production Systems in subsea; and digital will enhance it all. In our business and the industry as a whole, the increased adoption and integration of digital technologies remains one of the most significant opportunities for growth. Indeed, our industry generates massive amounts of data, and by capturing that information and turning it into trusted and actionable insights, we can make energy production more accessible, more affordable, and more sustainable. This is a critical moment for our industry, and there are three digital trends concurrently shaping its future, clearly setting the path for a higher value lower carbon outlook. First, the adoption of cloud computing at scale. For geoscience workflows, this is supporting significant productivity gains for geoscientists and engineers across asset development teams. This is happening at a time when our industry is compelled to accelerate the development cycle and de-risk both subsurface and surface uncertainties. We continue to benefit from this trend in the adoption of our Delfi cloud-based digital platform, delivered through a flexible and personalized software- as-a-service SaaS subscription model with the cumulative number of users in global customer organizations growing 60% year-on-year to 5400. As we shared in our earnings press release, Petrobras and ENAP are only just two examples of customers deploying Delfi enterprise-wide with the aim of fundamentally changing how they work across the E&P value chain. Second, our industry is unlocking the power of data at scale. A single well can produce more than 10 terabytes of data per day. And this doesn\u2019t even begin to touch on the total amount of upstream data across exploration, development, and production workflows. The adoption of open data platforms across the industry is liberating data for artificial intelligence AI applications at scale. SLB is benefiting from and driving this trend through both data foundations and AI deployment. We are seeing early success with the commercialization of our Enterprise Data Solution powered by Microsoft Energy Data Services. This offering delivers the most comprehensive capabilities for subsurface data in alignment with the emerging requirements of the OSDU Technical Standard. And we are witnessing tremendous success with our Innovation Factori, where we have developed more than 100 AI solutions with more than 80 customers since 2021, all of them with rich domain content in addition to generic AI capabilities. Third, digital operations are gaining in maturity, transforming the way operators develop and utilize assets. From automation to autonomous operations across both well construction and production, we are clearly seeing an inflection in the deployment of digital operations with significant impacts on efficiency, carbon footprint, and performance. Today, customers are accelerating their adoption of our Neuro autonomous solutions, with Kuwait Oil Company and PETRONAS both using these technologies to reduce manual operations while increasing performance, enabling drilling consistency and rig time savings. Similarly, our partnership with Cognite as a platform for unlocking access to production operations is gaining momentum in the industry, as exemplified with the Cairn contract highlighted in our earnings release. Finally, we continue to deploy Delfi Edge Agora technologies to deliver real-time insights directly within operations from connected hardware, where data is generated and processed with AI at the edge. We currently have more than 1,400 connected assets deployed, doubling year-on-year. SLB is positioned to fully harness these positive market conditions as well as our technology and digital leadership to drive financial outperformance and margin expansion. We are progressing on our journey to double the size of our digital business between 2021 and 2025, and the trends I have just discussed are reinforcing our confidence in the outcome of our strategy execution. I\u2019ll next describe how we see the rest of the year progressing. After a positive first half, we remain confident in our full-year financial ambitions and have visibility into a significant baseload of activity that reinforces our 2023 full-year forecasts, and our growth ambition beyond. We continue to expect year-on-year revenue growth of more than 15% and adjusted EBITDA growth in the mid-20s. Turning specifically to the third quarter, we expect revenue to grow by mid-single digits in the international markets, with all international geographical areas growing sequentially, led by the Middle East and Asia. In contrast, North America revenue will be slightly down. With our focus on the quality of revenue, harnessing operating leverage, and further technology adoption, we expect global operating margins to further expand by more than 50 basis points sequentially. This will result into the highest EBITDA margin we have seen in this cycle. I will now turn the call over to Stephane.\nStephane Biguet: Thank you, Olivier and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Second quarter earnings per share excluding charges and credits was $0.72. This represents an increase of $0.09 sequentially and $0.22, or 44%, when compared to the second quarter of last year. We did not record any charges or credits during the current quarter. Overall, our second quarter revenue of $8.1 billion increased 5% sequentially, mostly driven by the international markets led by the Middle East and Asia. Sequentially, our pretax segment operating margins increased 154 basis points due to the high quality international revenue, which resulted in strong incremental margins. This performance highlights the underlying earnings potential of our international business, with new technology and high service intensity particularly offshore accelerating margin expansion. Company-wide adjusted EBITDA margin for the second quarter was 24.2%. In absolute dollars, adjusted EBITDA increased 28% year-on-year. As a reminder, our ambition is for adjusted EBITDA to grow, in percentage terms, in the mid-20s for the full-year of 2023. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted EBITDA has grown 35%; so we are on track to achieve this goal. Second quarter revenue increased 20% year-on-year as international revenue was up 21%, significantly outpacing North America revenue growth of 14%. The strong international growth was led by the Middle East and Asia and robust offshore activity. Pretax segment operating margins expanded 240 basis points year-on-year with significant margin growth in our core divisions. Let me now go through the second quarter results for each division. Second quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $947 million increased 6% sequentially with margins increasing 4 percentage points to 34%. The sequential revenue growth and margin expansion were primarily driven by higher digital sales, following the seasonal low of the first quarter. Year-on-year Digital & Integration revenue decreased 1% and margins declined 6 percentage points due to the absence of exceptional exploration data transfer fees we recorded in the second quarter of last year. Growth in other digital products and services was strong, however, including a more than 60% year-on-year revenue increase in our cloud and edge solutions. Reservoir Performance revenue of $1.6 billion increased 9% sequentially, while margins improved 248 basis points to 18.6%. These increases were primarily due to strong growth internationally, led by the Middle East and Asia. Year-on-year, revenue grew 23% and margins increased 396 basis points driven by strong growth internationally, both on land and offshore. Well Construction revenue of $3.4 billion increased 3% sequentially, while margins of 21.8% increased 115 basis points driven by strong measurements, fluids and equipment sales activity as well as pricing improvements internationally. Year-on-year revenue grew 25%, while margins expanded 424 basis points with very strong growth across all geographical areas on higher activity and improved pricing. Finally, Production Systems revenue of $2.3 billion increased 5% sequentially and margins expanded 274 basis points to 12%, representing the highest margin since the formation of the division. The sequential revenue growth was led by the Middle East and Asia, partially offset by the absence of significant project milestones we reached last quarter in Europe and Africa. Year-on-year, revenue increased 22%, while margins expanded 300 basis points driven by higher sales of completions and surface production systems and the easing of supply chain and logistics constraints. Now turning to our liquidity. During the quarter, we generated $1.6 billion of cash flow from operations and free cash flow of $986 million. This represents a $1.25 billion increase in free cash flow over the same quarter of last year, which is largely due to improved working capital. We expect this performance to continue throughout the rest of the year. As a result, our free cash flow in the second half of the year will be materially higher than the first half. Our net debt reduced approximately $200 million sequentially to $10.1 billion, which is $900 million lower than the same period last year. Capital investments, inclusive of CapEx and investments in APS projects and exploration data, were $622 million in the second quarter. For the full-year, we are still expecting capital investments to be approximately $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion. We continued our stock buyback program and repurchased 4.5 million shares during the quarter for a total purchase price of $213 million. We continue to target to return $2 billion to our shareholders this year between dividends and stock buybacks. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Stephane. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe we are ready to open the floor to your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nJames West: Hey. Good morning, Olivier, Stephane.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Good morning, James.\nStephane Biguet: Good morning.\nJames West: So Olivier, we've \u2013 especially, you and I and Stephane spent a lot of time together in the last 18 months. Let's \u2013 if we go back to Luzern and then to the Analyst Day in New York City and recent events. We've become increasingly, I think all three of us bullish on the cycle and the cycle's duration especially. I wonder if you could comment on the duration aspect you see now as you travel around the world, you meet with your customers, you're talking to your customers, what are they saying about their drilling programs over the next several years? You obviously made some pretty bullish comments around Saudi, but more broadly with your major customers, what are their expectations? And how are they thinking about duration of their upstream spending cycle?\nOlivier Le Peuch: No, very good question, James. I think you may have realized that recently, we characterized the cycle as breadth, resilience and durability. And let me comment a little bit further on durability. And there are two or three elements to this. I think, obviously, we did comment on the return of offshore where we were the first to flag it and to call for the return of offshore. And I think we have seen this international offshore resurgence materializing in the last 12 months and accelerating. And in the second half, actually, the offshore rig count will be higher than the land rig count increase. So this momentum is driven by the economics of offshore assets where the FID now \u2013 the vast measure of the FID are below $50 and favorably positioned for FID. Also, the geologic and the low carbon nature of most of the assets, accessibility to these resources, and is both oil and gas. So offshore is having a resurgence that is translating into a very significant pipeline of FID, and we see it across not only the IOCs and independents that capturing this opportunity, but also the NOCs that have placed a bet on offshore, as you can see from Brazil to Middle East or the North Sea. So we see this happening at scale. We see also the emergence sort of the second leg of FID and future offshore expansion driven by exploration appraisal. Exploration appraisal is happening in many countries. There are many rounds of licensing rounds happening, a lot of exploration and appraisal is happening to find this next reserve and develop. So offshore is there to stay and not only in 2024 or 2025, but beyond as we can see, and with the second leg materializing. Beyond that, obviously, Middle East has made a significant commitment of capacity expansion both in oil of 4 million barrels or so and in gas for regional consumption, displacing oil for energy or for generating some blue ammonia or blue hydrogen products as well as further expanding the NG exports in Qatar, particularly. So the Middle East capacity expansion is leading to, as we have been quoting a record level of investment from this year onward, and is not set to again stop in 2024 as the vast majority of this capital expansion are towards the second half of the decade 2027 or 2030 for some of the target. So what we have seen lately and the feedback to the visits we have had is that the duration of the cycle as we were characterizing a year-ago is actually extending and is to be believed, prolonging to the right, and with a combination of offshore resurgence being very solid and Middle East being a capacity expansion beyond the next three years.\nJames West: Okay. That makes a lot of sense. And then the \u2013 maybe a follow-up. As we think about \u2013 or as you think about, I guess, revenue quality as we go through this, what looks to be and appears to be and I think we agree on a long duration cycle. You can upgrade your revenue quality either by choosing offshore over onshore or customers by customer. How are you thinking about that quality of the revenue base that you put in place now? And what are the main kind of drivers of that of assuming that you're looking for the highest return and highest margin? But what are the key metrics or key assumptions you have there?\nOlivier Le Peuch: No, absolutely. I think we have been initiating the returns focused strategy a few years back. And I think we are getting the characteristics of cycle that's favoring and accelerating our strategy as we get the opportunity to not only get a favorable mix that included a bit more offshore Middle East exploration appraisal, but also higher technology adoption, including digital, including fit technology or including transition technology, all combining to give a premium to the \u2013 and a higher revenue quality. But I will not forget also the capital discipline that we have initiated as part of this strategy that is pushing us to high grade to the higher returns, higher margins contract as we move forward, and make sure that we get the best return for the capital we deployed and also to put a clear threshold on capital investment and capital stewardship going forward. So the combination, as I said, of the favorable mix, the technology adoption at scale with some secular trends in digital and the capital discipline that we have used to execute our strategy are allowing us to create the revenue quality improvement and the high grading on every portfolio and every business line we have to drive margin expansion. And we have seen margin expansion increasing, and we will continue to post this as we move forward.\nJames West: Thanks so much, Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, James.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Anderson with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nDavid Anderson: Great. Thank you. Good morning, Olivier. How are you?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Good morning, Dave.\nDavid Anderson: So I was curious on the Middle East Asia showed really impressive sequential growth during the quarter. I was wondering if you could talk a bit about what drove that. Was that just a reflection of the steady ramp-up of projects in Saudi and other Middle East markets, and also, you mentioned a directional drilling contract in the release. Was that a discrete contract? I know you're starting to see higher pricing on those types of contracts now?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Well, I think to be \u2013 to stay very broad term, I think, it's Middle East and Asia, and there are several GeoUnits, as we call them, that have been benefiting from very significant growth sequential and year-on-year as we commented, many of them are in the 30% basket \u2013 more than 30% basket growth year-on-year in that region that area. But indeed, in the GCC and the Middle East, particularly we are benefiting again, we say from three things. We are benefiting from the capacity expansion programs that have been initiated that have turned into an inflection into reactivity and spend activity that you benefit from considering our market exposure. We have been renewing several contracts and either encroaching or gaining market and strengthening our market position. And you have seen several announcements made. And this includes service capacity, service expansion contracts more than, I would say, integrated contracts. And finally, we have been benefiting from \u2013 based on our performance from, I would say, pricing increments based on performance that have all combined service contract expansion, reactivity increase and pricing all combining to result into an incremental revenue year-on-year and sequentially that we believe will be on the continuum for the rest of the year.\nDavid Anderson: Okay. Thank you. And if I could shift over to the D&I segment. Could you provide some color on the non-APS businesses and how they've been trending? I'm particularly interested in the digital solutions business and kind of really what you're seeing in terms of digital adoption of your customers. I'm not sure if you can provide any metrics or any examples, but just kind of curious kind of how some of your customers are using it kind of this year versus a year ago. Is there any way to kind of show us kind of \u2013 or kind of explain to us kind of how that digital adoption is trending?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yes. I think as we keep saying, I think some of the digital success and digital business growth we are having today is a bit masked in our financial reporting results by the flat or declining. APS year-on-year that we have. So I think you have to look at it first on the financial overall result of this division. Secondly, I would say that as I described in my prepared remarks that there are three trends that we are capturing and that we are exposed to that are happening in the industry, all of them under the secular trend of digital transformation in this industry, one on cloud computing, making the best out of cloud computing, scalable computing and elastic computing access that cloud solutions such as Delfi gives, and enhance accelerating productivity of the asset team from exploration to asset development. We are seeing it. You have seen the announcement of the Petrobras award that is square into that category of using cloud capability to accelerate and enable productivity in the geoscience team and quality of results for the asset development team. So that's one sector. And again, we measure it by either a number of customers' expansion or adoption of users, which we have seen are quoted in my prepared remarks at 60% growth year-on-year. The second aspect is unlocking data, the vast amount of data that our industry manipulates, stores, manages and structured data, unstructured data to try to unlock this and democratize, if you like, AI. So we are fortunate to have a cloud-based solution, Delfi that has AI domain capability embedded into it, and we use it every day to help our customers unlock and get access to this AI capability. We have done at Innovation Factori, 100 solutions deployed. So that's the second engine of digital growth, if you like, is the data structure, data transformation and AI capability. And that's again, we are speaking about growing at above 50% for that subsegment of our digital offering. And last, and maybe the one that has the most growth potential that is untapped across the industry, digital operation. That's everywhere from well construction to producing assets. And that's why we deploy either some element of our cloud offering in drilling automation or in surveillance of assets or we deploy at the edge on the asset at the pump some device, and we call it the Agora Edge solution, which have embedded AI at the edge that do not need to run trips to the cloud to optimize these assets and give \u2013 and we use it and consume it in our APS assets to enhance the performance. So we are seeing the benefit of all these at the same time. They're all growing at a different pace, different adoption across the NOCs, the independents, all the IOCs. And it will be a long tail of growth that will clearly have a long durability and we continue to be a factor of secular trend in our industry to extract efficiency, low carbon productivity using this trend. So that's what we see, multiple engines of growth across multiple horizons. And with different technology where we have leadership in most and a footprint that allows us to tap into 1,500 customers for the long run.\nOperator: We will go ahead and move on to the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan Chase. Please go ahead.\nArun Jayaram: Yes. Good morning, Olivier. My first question is on offshore. You've highlighted how 85% of global offshore FIDs are now underpinned by oil prices at $50 or below which is quite a bit below what we saw in the prior cycle where we thought that you needed, call it, mid-60s oil price to kind of justify offshore developments, particularly deepwater. I was wondering if you can give some thoughts on what is driving, call it, the lower breakevens than we saw prior cycle?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I would think there are several aspects to that. One obviously is the progress the industry at large has made in efficiency, integration, technology, performance at large that is getting the curve shifting to the left on drilling the cycle compressing on subsea and the overall development cycle to be more derisked to digital. So technology, integration, performance at large has helped the operator and the service industry to deliver faster and to deliver the lower total cost, the development of those assets. The second element, I would think is that exploration has been creating a portfolio of assets that can then been high-graded. And then the quality of the resource, the high quality of the geological play and lower carbon and better plays that have a better production and recovery potential, have also emerged and have been more favorably primed and/or, I would say, prioritized by our customers. So these customers have choice and they focus on the best and the most advantageous assets and the most advantageous geological basins as we have seen it from Brazil to Guyana, and we are seeing in the Middle East for some of the gas assets as well. So the third, I think, dimension that is, I think, accelerating in our opinion is what is called infrastructure-led development or infrastructure-led exploration and development, which make the returns on incremental oil, incremental gas from existing hubs from an existing platform, lower cost than in the past because the capability to infill tieback and expand from an existing platform, getting a better return on existing infrastructure. Hence, we have seen a significant improvement and significant increase on investment into this infill and tieback and ILX, and it is called infrastructure-led development, infrastructure-led exploration, and that's \u2013 this is another trend that is lowering the average cost of FID for increment of oil pool or additional gas. So you combine all of this and you are getting better economics, hence, better and sustained and higher durability for the long-term offshore play.\nArun Jayaram: Great. Thanks for that. And just a follow-up, Olivier, we've been getting a few buy-side questions on the update on your website regarding Russia. I was wondering if you could just expand on what this means on a go-forward basis for SLB.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Simply said, I think Russia revenue represented approximately 5% of our consolidated revenue in the second quarter and the decision that we have made last Friday to halt remaining shipments to Russia from all SLB facilities will not impact our financial guidance. So this decision will extend what you have seen as our previous ban on shipments from the locations that we had in the United States, the U.K., EU, Canada, into Russia, and we will continue to ensure that our remaining presence in Russia, meets and exceeds all international sanctions.\nArun Jayaram: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you.\nOperator: And I apologize, we will go back to the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nScott Gruber: Yes. Good morning.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Good morning, Scott.\nScott Gruber: Yes. D&I margins snap back nicely in 2Q. And in the past, you've talked about D&I as a mid-30s type margin business, at least near term. But in terms of thinking about the second half, can you build off that 34%? Should we expect those to grind higher in 3Q and 4Q? And then more importantly, as we think about 2024 and given all the digital growth you think D&I margins could push into the high 30s, especially with hopefully some of the APS headwinds abating?\nStephane Biguet: Hey, Scott. Stephane here. So yes, you've seen the D&I margins returning to levels we like in the mid-30s after the Q1 seasonal low and just for clarification, this is almost entirely coming from digital because APS ended up somehow and expectedly flat in terms of revenue. So really the entire margin expansion from Q1 to Q2 is digital, which is good news. So can it go up higher than 34%. Yes, potentially, you always have \u2013 you can have certain sales like exploration data, et cetera, that come, but the mid-30s is a good goal post for us with a few percentages up and down depending on exceptional sales.\nScott Gruber: And we should still think about that in 2024 as well?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yes. Through 2024 in the trajectory we see in digital is not set to slow down because I think as I explained, multiple dimensions and trends are concurrently shaping the future of our digital success, and I think we expect it to continue well into the \u2013 beyond the cycle, as we call it, actually, and the accretive, I would say, contribution of digital will over time, long-term, be more and more accretive on the growth and more and more accretive on the margins.\nScott Gruber: Got it. And then just a quick one on North America. Pretty impressive performance in 2Q with revenues up and the rig count \u2013 in contrast to the rig count being down. Obviously, Gulf of Mexico is helping you guys. Are you also seeing continued growth in that fit-for-basin strategy? Yes, go ahead.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Absolutely. I think that's what we call agility and fit strategy in the land part of the North America has been helping us to shield ourselves from some of the macro trends. I think we believe that the lack of exposure to pressure pumping at scale and the fit-for-basin technology strategy, partly in well construction has allowed us to continue to progress or to buffer some other activity decline and expose us to actually the mix of performance that has been resilient in North America land and then complemented augmented, if I may, by the North America offshore, where we have seen activity and revenue progression.\nScott Gruber: Got it. I appreciate all the color. Let's put it back.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we go to the line of Kurt Hallead with Benchmark. Please go ahead.\nKurt Hallead: Hey. Thank you. Good afternoon, everybody.\nStephane Biguet: Hey, Kurt.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Good afternoon, Kurt.\nKurt Hallead: So you guys put up a really impressive free cash flow number in the quarter. You indicated that free cash flow dynamics would obviously improve in the second half of the year. So I'm just kind of curious, though, close to $1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter itself. Is this the dynamic now where you can continue to harvest that kind of cash? And is that level of free cash flow is something that you think could be sustainable as you go into the third and fourth quarter of this year?\nStephane Biguet: So look, yes, we are also quite pleased with the free cash flow performance in the second quarter. It's \u2013 as I said, it's mostly improved working capital on top of the earnings, of course. And as you know, there is quite some seasonality in our cash flow and working capital. So we came out of a seasonally low Q1 with quite a strong Q2. We again beat a quarterly record on DSO for our second quarter, and our inventory efficiency improved quite a bit as well. So it sets us quite well for the rest of the year. As you said, we always generate quite more cash in the second half. So the $1 billion level is a good starting point for Q3, Q4, and we'll take it from there. But we are slightly ahead of where we wanted to be, and I think we can continue that way for the second half.\nKurt Hallead: All right. That's great. That's fantastic. And my follow-up, so Olivier, a lot of contract awards during the quarter. You discussed the emphasis on long-term visibility on a number of these projects. It's easy for us on the outside to kind of look at what goes on with an offshore driller and look at their contract start date sometime in the future. Maybe a little bit more challenging to kind of connect those dots to how a service company and at what point in time does a service company get slotted in for those projects. So I was just wondering for the benefit of everybody on the call and understanding where your visibility is coming from. At what point in time do you guys think that the Schlumberger get called into an offshore drilling project, for example? And what gives you the conviction and how can you can convey that conviction to the investor base and understanding that this cycle really does is different and has longer legs than what we may have seen in the past?\nOlivier Le Peuch: No, I think it's a mix. It's a mix of \u2013 I think we and you have seen many contracts, some of them have very long duration, more than five years or seven years and recent award that we highlighted in April and this July. And I think it's three to five years is typical contract terms that we have every contract you see, framework contracts that are being used to mobilize resources and to commit capacity across multiple years, and these contracts either start this year or start next year. And they go well beyond 2025 and support the thesis of durability duration beyond mid this decade, and secondly, I would say that you see also that we were announcing a few of the subsea award, and we'll continue to see that in the second half. We quoted our total booking for Production Systems, which is the long cycle side of our business. So you have the contracts, I was referring to service contracts, three, five, seven years, and many of them in Middle East or offshore, as you have seen, and then you have the bookings that then have bookings that are than supporting two or three years of delivery, be it in subsea or bit in some of the large surface contract that you have seen in Qatar, Subsea, as you have seen in different parts of the Americas and \u2013 or Turkey. And this is typically two or three years out of booking, and we have been quoting $10 billion to $12 billion for the full-year on Production Systems, and we are confident this represents 1.1 to 1.3 book-to-bill ratio. And this, as we will exit 2023, we'll have this booking to fuel at least two years of growth going forward in our long-cycle business. So you combine these and you get many of the elements of duration on international, Middle East, and offshore markets.\nKurt Hallead: That's great. Really appreciate the color. Thank you.\nOlivier Le Peuch: You're welcome.\nStephane Biguet: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNeil Mehta: Yes. Good morning, team.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Hi, Neil.\nNeil Mehta: Good morning. The first question is just around Production Systems. Margins were really good there. So can you talk about how we should think about the margin trajectory? And also tie that into any commentary you have around the subsea, which has been a source of momentum?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yes. I think Production Systems is, as I said, is an equipment mostly product equipment and long cycle and on which we had suffered from some supply logistics constraints last year that we flagged, and we said at the onset as soon as this constraint will be behind us, we'll feel comfortable that the momentum on margin expansion will be matching what we have seen in the other core divisions that we have and this is starting to materialize. Our ambition is not stopping at this margin. Our long-term ambition is to continue to grow and expand in line with the overall core divisions as we believe that operating efficiency, including into this long cycle manufacturing efficiency, and the pricing environment for this unique technology we have from subsea to surface from completion to artificial lift or some process equipment that we are deploying across some offshore FPSO. All of this combines to give us the, I would say, the confidence that this trajectory of margin expansion will not stop here and will continue to grow. You have heard about the booking, I was commenting on this. It's a booking and margin expansion journey for PS going forward.\nNeil Mehta: And Olivier, when we saw each other a couple of weeks ago, you had just spent a lot of time on the road visiting a lot of customers in different regions. Wonder if you can just kind of go around the world and talk about customer conversations, obviously, name agnostic, and what are you seeing in terms of different basins in terms of activity?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I don't want to be too specific, obviously. I think I will reflect more on the general sentiment. I think the general sentiment is that first and foremost, energy security and capacity expansion still dominate the decision and the economics are seen as very favorable and the outlook of the industry at large is seen as resilient and you have seen it for many majors, reaffirming their 2030 production volume and adjusting their strategy to make sure they maximize the opportunity to either accelerate their gas transition or sustain their oil production. And this will mean investment, and we see that in all the engagement we have. And then the NOCs, be it in the Americas, in Africa, Middle East or Asia, pursuing the two things, either their production enhancement to make sure they continue to lift their production performance, and then addressing security \u2013 energy security through their gas development, typically. We see this everywhere, partly in Asia. So the customers are fairly focused on developing their gas assets, expanding and/or reverting some of the trends of declining oil production and to make sure they maximize the cycle, their participation to the cycle and their participation to the international pool \u2013 supply pool that is happening. So it's broad. And as I commented during our time together, I think I commented that we are seeing also many newcomers that are expanding into deepwater, into exploration rounds that are across the globe in new territories or in new countries, and this will attract more investment. This will attract, if the geology are right, future FID. So it's, in general, driven by energy security, pool of international supply, and IOCs\u2019 commitment to sustain their position towards the end of the decade.\nNeil Mehta: Thank so much.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you.\nOperator: And next, we go to a question from Luke Lemoine. Please go ahead.\nLuke Lemoine: Hey. Good morning.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Good morning.\nLuke Lemoine: Good morning. Olivier, impressive award with a five-year contract with Petrobras for Delfi deployment across the organization, seeing if you can maybe talk about the opportunity for additional contracts with other NOCs or majors for enterprise-wide Delfi and kind of the level of interest there?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yes. We typically do not speak ahead of any public announcements, the work we are doing on the ground to continue to prepare for further penetration of our existing customers. But yes, there are fairly advanced discussions with several customers to prepare for a transition and adoption of Delfi cloud solution, either for their geoscience workflow or for some of the drilling operations as I was referring to or for some of the adoption of AI and unlocking that data. So we are seeing this. And yes, you will see \u2013 you continue to see every quarter a new announcement that will come in the different, the three different dimension and trends that I was highlighting. And you will see large contract in the future, hopefully, materializing as well that will replicate the success we had with Chevron, who was the first very large enterprise deployment that many company are looking to towards and using to reflect some of their future opportunity they have with us. So that's happening at scale and we are pleased with progress. But again, it's a long journey and it's one customer at a time, and it will take years and the cycle will be long and will be accretive for the long run.\nLuke Lemoine: Okay. Got it. Thanks, Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you\nOperator: And our next question is from Keith MacKey with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nKeith MacKey: Hi. Good morning. Good afternoon, everyone.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Good morning, Keith.\nKeith MacKey: Just wanted to first ask on the subsea JV with Subsea 7 and Aker originally expected to close at the end of next month. Can you just remind us of the key benefits of that transaction? Maybe give us an update on where you are in relation to closing. And if you expect any impact to the numbers or the way you might report the numbers in the Production Systems segment going forward, would be helpful.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yes. First, I think we \u2013 what we quoted at the time we announced the JV is that we expected this to close by Q3 this year, which is in two months from now. The progress we have made is that we have progressed towards obtaining the majority of the antitrust regulatory approval to move forward. We have progress in our planning in conjunction with our future partners and we'll be communicating on this as soon as we can to give you the materiality and the timing and the materiality of this as we will consolidate. Now it will be consolidated into the PS and into the revenue going forward at the time we will announce the closing, and we will give you the detailed information about that when it will be announced, and we'll give clarity on the way we will report it. So good progress across the different jurisdiction and good progress, very good progress on the planning to prepare for the closing as well. So we're optimistic towards the near future.\nKeith MacKey: Thank you. Appreciate the comments. And one final question for Stephane, just on the buyback. As free cash flow is set to increase in the second half of the year, should we expect any significant deviation from the $200 million-or-so run rate you've set for the first half of the year? Or is that still a good number to put in our models?\nStephane Biguet: Look, the way you have to look at it, Keith, is really on our commitment to return a total of $2 billion to shareholders and it's between dividends and buybacks. So, yes, if you do the math, you will get the average level of buyback in the second quarter \u2013 or in the second half, sorry. But yes, it will continue, of course.\nKeith MacKey: Perfect. Thanks very much.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time we have for questions. I will now turn the conference back to the SLB leadership for closing comments.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Leah. Ladies and gentlemen, as we conclude today\u2019s call, I would like to leave you with the following takeaways: First, as our second quarter results clearly demonstrate, our market position, performance differentiation, and technology leadership are fit for the cycle and will continue to drive our financial performance. Second, as upstream investments accelerate in the international and offshore markets, these regions will lead our growth and lay a strong foundation for ongoing outperformance in the years ahead. Third, following a solid first half and with significant visibility into the second half of the year, we reaffirm our confidence in our full-year financial targets. This is a compelling environment for our company, and today we are more returns-focused, disciplined, and efficient than ever before. We could not ask for a better backdrop to execute our commitment to shareholder returns. I remain very confident in our strategy and fully trust the SLB team to continue delivering strong performance for our business. With this, I will conclude today\u2019s call. Thank you all for joining.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Stephane Biguet",
            "content": "Thank you, Olivier and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Second quarter earnings per share excluding charges and credits was $0.72. This represents an increase of $0.09 sequentially and $0.22, or 44%, when compared to the second quarter of last year. We did not record any charges or credits during the current quarter. Overall, our second quarter revenue of $8.1 billion increased 5% sequentially, mostly driven by the international markets led by the Middle East and Asia. Sequentially, our pretax segment operating margins increased 154 basis points due to the high quality international revenue, which resulted in strong incremental margins. This performance highlights the underlying earnings potential of our international business, with new technology and high service intensity particularly offshore accelerating margin expansion. Company-wide adjusted EBITDA margin for the second quarter was 24.2%. In absolute dollars, adjusted EBITDA increased 28% year-on-year. As a reminder, our ambition is for adjusted EBITDA to grow, in percentage terms, in the mid-20s for the full-year of 2023. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted EBITDA has grown 35%; so we are on track to achieve this goal. Second quarter revenue increased 20% year-on-year as international revenue was up 21%, significantly outpacing North America revenue growth of 14%. The strong international growth was led by the Middle East and Asia and robust offshore activity. Pretax segment operating margins expanded 240 basis points year-on-year with significant margin growth in our core divisions. Let me now go through the second quarter results for each division. Second quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $947 million increased 6% sequentially with margins increasing 4 percentage points to 34%. The sequential revenue growth and margin expansion were primarily driven by higher digital sales, following the seasonal low of the first quarter. Year-on-year Digital & Integration revenue decreased 1% and margins declined 6 percentage points due to the absence of exceptional exploration data transfer fees we recorded in the second quarter of last year. Growth in other digital products and services was strong, however, including a more than 60% year-on-year revenue increase in our cloud and edge solutions. Reservoir Performance revenue of $1.6 billion increased 9% sequentially, while margins improved 248 basis points to 18.6%. These increases were primarily due to strong growth internationally, led by the Middle East and Asia. Year-on-year, revenue grew 23% and margins increased 396 basis points driven by strong growth internationally, both on land and offshore. Well Construction revenue of $3.4 billion increased 3% sequentially, while margins of 21.8% increased 115 basis points driven by strong measurements, fluids and equipment sales activity as well as pricing improvements internationally. Year-on-year revenue grew 25%, while margins expanded 424 basis points with very strong growth across all geographical areas on higher activity and improved pricing. Finally, Production Systems revenue of $2.3 billion increased 5% sequentially and margins expanded 274 basis points to 12%, representing the highest margin since the formation of the division. The sequential revenue growth was led by the Middle East and Asia, partially offset by the absence of significant project milestones we reached last quarter in Europe and Africa. Year-on-year, revenue increased 22%, while margins expanded 300 basis points driven by higher sales of completions and surface production systems and the easing of supply chain and logistics constraints. Now turning to our liquidity. During the quarter, we generated $1.6 billion of cash flow from operations and free cash flow of $986 million. This represents a $1.25 billion increase in free cash flow over the same quarter of last year, which is largely due to improved working capital. We expect this performance to continue throughout the rest of the year. As a result, our free cash flow in the second half of the year will be materially higher than the first half. Our net debt reduced approximately $200 million sequentially to $10.1 billion, which is $900 million lower than the same period last year. Capital investments, inclusive of CapEx and investments in APS projects and exploration data, were $622 million in the second quarter. For the full-year, we are still expecting capital investments to be approximately $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion. We continued our stock buyback program and repurchased 4.5 million shares during the quarter for a total purchase price of $213 million. We continue to target to return $2 billion to our shareholders this year between dividends and stock buybacks. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier. Good morning. Hey, Scott. Stephane here. So yes, you've seen the D&I margins returning to levels we like in the mid-30s after the Q1 seasonal low and just for clarification, this is almost entirely coming from digital because APS ended up somehow and expectedly flat in terms of revenue. So really the entire margin expansion from Q1 to Q2 is digital, which is good news. So can it go up higher than 34%. Yes, potentially, you always have \u2013 you can have certain sales like exploration data, et cetera, that come, but the mid-30s is a good goal post for us with a few percentages up and down depending on exceptional sales. Hey, Kurt. So look, yes, we are also quite pleased with the free cash flow performance in the second quarter. It's \u2013 as I said, it's mostly improved working capital on top of the earnings, of course. And as you know, there is quite some seasonality in our cash flow and working capital. So we came out of a seasonally low Q1 with quite a strong Q2. We again beat a quarterly record on DSO for our second quarter, and our inventory efficiency improved quite a bit as well. So it sets us quite well for the rest of the year. As you said, we always generate quite more cash in the second half. So the $1 billion level is a good starting point for Q3, Q4, and we'll take it from there. But we are slightly ahead of where we wanted to be, and I think we can continue that way for the second half. Thank you. Look, the way you have to look at it, Keith, is really on our commitment to return a total of $2 billion to shareholders and it's between dividends and buybacks. So, yes, if you do the math, you will get the average level of buyback in the second quarter \u2013 or in the second half, sorry. But yes, it will continue, of course."

            "name": "Olivier Le Peuch",
            "content": "Thank you, James. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on the call today. In my prepared remarks, I will cover three topics. I will first review a few of our financial highlights from the quarter. Next, I will discuss the positive momentum we are seeing in the international and offshore markets. And third, I will share the exciting progress we are making in digital before concluding with our outlook for the third quarter and the full-year. Stephane will then provide more details on our financial results, and we will open for your questions. Our second quarter results continue to demonstrate the strength of our portfolio and our strategic positioning in the most attractive, accretive, and resilient markets globally. This is translating to financial performance, and we closed the first half of the year with solid growth across revenue, earnings per share, free cash flow, and expanded EBITDA and pre-tax segment operating margins. International revenue continued its strong growth momentum, increasing 21% year-on-year as we captured broad growth across all divisions and geographic areas. Second quarter revenue increased by more than 20% year-on-year in 14 of our 25 international GeoUnits. Most notably, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Mexico, Guyana, Brazil, Angola, Caspian, and India all grew more than 30% over this period. This drove our highest year-on-year international incremental operating margin over the last three years, and it underscores the breadth of our portfolio that I continue to emphasize. SLB's global reach shields us from regional fluctuations, as we have recently seen in North America, and give us the ability to seize opportunities wherever they arise. This is a true differentiator for our business and positions us for long-term outperformance. Following the remarks I shared in our earnings release this morning, I would like to reflect on a few notable highlights from the quarter. The broad growth characterizing this upcycle continues. Internationally, this was pervasive, and we were very pleased to see all divisions and geographies grow revenue and expand margins sequentially. In North America, we continued to increase our revenue, highlighting our agility across the land markets and the expanded activity in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, solidly outperforming the rig count. Our focus on the quality of our revenue continues to support our margins. Sequentially, we expanded our pretax segment operating margin. This was fueled by our strong international operating leverage, increased technology adoption, and positive pricing trends that stemmed from inflation-driven contract adjustments and tight service capacity. And with higher earnings and improved working capital, our sequential cash flow from operations grew considerably, and we generated free cash flow of nearly $1 billion during the quarter. I want to thank the entire SLB team for their hard work and exceptional performance delivering value for our customers and our shareholders throughout the quarter. Now, let me take a moment to touch on the macro environment. As we have projected for the past few quarters, the international and offshore markets continue to exhibit strong growth as North America has moderated. This is playing to the strengths of our business, as international revenue represents nearly 80% of our global portfolio, and offshore comprises nearly half of that. As the growth rate shifts further toward international, these market conditions are driving the breadth, resilience, and durability of this upcycle and creating new opportunities for our business. Let me describe where this is taking place. In the international markets, the investment momentum of the past few years is accelerating. This is supported by resilient long-cycle developments in Guyana, Brazil, Norway, and Turkey; production capacity expansions in the Middle East, notably in Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Qatar; the return of exploration and appraisal across Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean; and the recognition of gas as a critical fuel source for energy security and the energy transition. In the Middle East, this is resulting in record levels of upstream investment. From 2023 to 2025, Saudi Arabia is expected to allocate nearly $100 billion to upstream oil and gas capital expenditure, a 60% increase compared to the previous three years, as they invest to attain a maximum sustained production capacity of 13 million barrels per day by 2027. Several other countries in the region have also announced material increases in capital expenditures that extend beyond 2025. Furthermore, we continue to witness a broad resurgence in offshore driven by energy security and regionalization. Operators all over the world are making large-scale commitments to hasten discovery, accelerate development times, and increase the productivity of their assets. This is resulting in increased infill and tie back activity in mature basins, new development projects both in oil and gas, and support for new exploration. With this backdrop, we anticipate more than $500 billion in global FIDs between 2022 and 2025, with more than $200 billion attributable to deepwater. This reflects an increase of nearly 90% when compared to 2016-2019. These FID investments are global taking place in more than 30 countries, and we are seeing the results with new projects in offshore basins across the world. This is reflected in the many contract awards highlighted in the earnings press release, notably in Mexico, Brazil, and Turkey. These contracts, in addition to many others, are building a strong foundation of activity outlook decoupled from short-term commodity price volatility. Moving forward, we expect further growth to be led by accelerating activity in Well Construction, new opportunities for Reservoir Performance in exploration and appraisal, expansion for Production Systems in subsea; and digital will enhance it all. In our business and the industry as a whole, the increased adoption and integration of digital technologies remains one of the most significant opportunities for growth. Indeed, our industry generates massive amounts of data, and by capturing that information and turning it into trusted and actionable insights, we can make energy production more accessible, more affordable, and more sustainable. This is a critical moment for our industry, and there are three digital trends concurrently shaping its future, clearly setting the path for a higher value lower carbon outlook. First, the adoption of cloud computing at scale. For geoscience workflows, this is supporting significant productivity gains for geoscientists and engineers across asset development teams. This is happening at a time when our industry is compelled to accelerate the development cycle and de-risk both subsurface and surface uncertainties. We continue to benefit from this trend in the adoption of our Delfi cloud-based digital platform, delivered through a flexible and personalized software- as-a-service SaaS subscription model with the cumulative number of users in global customer organizations growing 60% year-on-year to 5400. As we shared in our earnings press release, Petrobras and ENAP are only just two examples of customers deploying Delfi enterprise-wide with the aim of fundamentally changing how they work across the E&P value chain. Second, our industry is unlocking the power of data at scale. A single well can produce more than 10 terabytes of data per day. And this doesn't even begin to touch on the total amount of upstream data across exploration, development, and production workflows. The adoption of open data platforms across the industry is liberating data for artificial intelligence AI applications at scale. SLB is benefiting from and driving this trend through both data foundations and AI deployment. We are seeing early success with the commercialization of our Enterprise Data Solution powered by Microsoft Energy Data Services. This offering delivers the most comprehensive capabilities for subsurface data in alignment with the emerging requirements of the OSDU Technical Standard. And we are witnessing tremendous success with our Innovation Factori, where we have developed more than 100 AI solutions with more than 80 customers since 2021, all of them with rich domain content in addition to generic AI capabilities. Third, digital operations are gaining in maturity, transforming the way operators develop and utilize assets. From automation to autonomous operations across both well construction and production, we are clearly seeing an inflection in the deployment of digital operations with significant impacts on efficiency, carbon footprint, and performance. Today, customers are accelerating their adoption of our Neuro autonomous solutions, with Kuwait Oil Company and PETRONAS both using these technologies to reduce manual operations while increasing performance, enabling drilling consistency and rig time savings. Similarly, our partnership with Cognite as a platform for unlocking access to production operations is gaining momentum in the industry, as exemplified with the Cairn contract highlighted in our earnings release. Finally, we continue to deploy Delfi Edge Agora technologies to deliver real-time insights directly within operations from connected hardware, where data is generated and processed with AI at the edge. We currently have more than 1,400 connected assets deployed, doubling year-on-year. SLB is positioned to fully harness these positive market conditions as well as our technology and digital leadership to drive financial outperformance and margin expansion. We are progressing on our journey to double the size of our digital business between 2021 and 2025, and the trends I have just discussed are reinforcing our confidence in the outcome of our strategy execution. I'll next describe how we see the rest of the year progressing. After a positive first half, we remain confident in our full-year financial ambitions and have visibility into a significant baseload of activity that reinforces our 2023 full-year forecasts, and our growth ambition beyond. We continue to expect year-on-year revenue growth of more than 15% and adjusted EBITDA growth in the mid-20s. Turning specifically to the third quarter, we expect revenue to grow by mid-single digits in the international markets, with all international geographical areas growing sequentially, led by the Middle East and Asia. In contrast, North America revenue will be slightly down. With our focus on the quality of revenue, harnessing operating leverage, and further technology adoption, we expect global operating margins to further expand by more than 50 basis points sequentially. This will result into the highest EBITDA margin we have seen in this cycle. I will now turn the call over to Stephane. Thank you, Stephane. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe we are ready to open the floor to your questions. Good morning, James. No, very good question, James. I think you may have realized that recently, we characterized the cycle as breadth, resilience and durability. And let me comment a little bit further on durability. And there are two or three elements to this. I think, obviously, we did comment on the return of offshore where we were the first to flag it and to call for the return of offshore. And I think we have seen this international offshore resurgence materializing in the last 12 months and accelerating. And in the second half, actually, the offshore rig count will be higher than the land rig count increase. So this momentum is driven by the economics of offshore assets where the FID now \u2013 the vast measure of the FID are below $50 and favorably positioned for FID. Also, the geologic and the low carbon nature of most of the assets, accessibility to these resources, and is both oil and gas. So offshore is having a resurgence that is translating into a very significant pipeline of FID, and we see it across not only the IOCs and independents that capturing this opportunity, but also the NOCs that have placed a bet on offshore, as you can see from Brazil to Middle East or the North Sea. So we see this happening at scale. We see also the emergence sort of the second leg of FID and future offshore expansion driven by exploration appraisal. Exploration appraisal is happening in many countries. There are many rounds of licensing rounds happening, a lot of exploration and appraisal is happening to find this next reserve and develop. So offshore is there to stay and not only in 2024 or 2025, but beyond as we can see, and with the second leg materializing. Beyond that, obviously, Middle East has made a significant commitment of capacity expansion both in oil of 4 million barrels or so and in gas for regional consumption, displacing oil for energy or for generating some blue ammonia or blue hydrogen products as well as further expanding the NG exports in Qatar, particularly. So the Middle East capacity expansion is leading to, as we have been quoting a record level of investment from this year onward, and is not set to again stop in 2024 as the vast majority of this capital expansion are towards the second half of the decade 2027 or 2030 for some of the target. So what we have seen lately and the feedback to the visits we have had is that the duration of the cycle as we were characterizing a year-ago is actually extending and is to be believed, prolonging to the right, and with a combination of offshore resurgence being very solid and Middle East being a capacity expansion beyond the next three years. No, absolutely. I think we have been initiating the returns focused strategy a few years back. And I think we are getting the characteristics of cycle that's favoring and accelerating our strategy as we get the opportunity to not only get a favorable mix that included a bit more offshore Middle East exploration appraisal, but also higher technology adoption, including digital, including fit technology or including transition technology, all combining to give a premium to the \u2013 and a higher revenue quality. But I will not forget also the capital discipline that we have initiated as part of this strategy that is pushing us to high grade to the higher returns, higher margins contract as we move forward, and make sure that we get the best return for the capital we deployed and also to put a clear threshold on capital investment and capital stewardship going forward. So the combination, as I said, of the favorable mix, the technology adoption at scale with some secular trends in digital and the capital discipline that we have used to execute our strategy are allowing us to create the revenue quality improvement and the high grading on every portfolio and every business line we have to drive margin expansion. And we have seen margin expansion increasing, and we will continue to post this as we move forward. Thank you, James. Good morning, Dave. Well, I think to be \u2013 to stay very broad term, I think, it's Middle East and Asia, and there are several GeoUnits, as we call them, that have been benefiting from very significant growth sequential and year-on-year as we commented, many of them are in the 30% basket \u2013 more than 30% basket growth year-on-year in that region that area. But indeed, in the GCC and the Middle East, particularly we are benefiting again, we say from three things. We are benefiting from the capacity expansion programs that have been initiated that have turned into an inflection into reactivity and spend activity that you benefit from considering our market exposure. We have been renewing several contracts and either encroaching or gaining market and strengthening our market position. And you have seen several announcements made. And this includes service capacity, service expansion contracts more than, I would say, integrated contracts. And finally, we have been benefiting from \u2013 based on our performance from, I would say, pricing increments based on performance that have all combined service contract expansion, reactivity increase and pricing all combining to result into an incremental revenue year-on-year and sequentially that we believe will be on the continuum for the rest of the year. Yes. I think as we keep saying, I think some of the digital success and digital business growth we are having today is a bit masked in our financial reporting results by the flat or declining. APS year-on-year that we have. So I think you have to look at it first on the financial overall result of this division. Secondly, I would say that as I described in my prepared remarks that there are three trends that we are capturing and that we are exposed to that are happening in the industry, all of them under the secular trend of digital transformation in this industry, one on cloud computing, making the best out of cloud computing, scalable computing and elastic computing access that cloud solutions such as Delfi gives, and enhance accelerating productivity of the asset team from exploration to asset development. We are seeing it. You have seen the announcement of the Petrobras award that is square into that category of using cloud capability to accelerate and enable productivity in the geoscience team and quality of results for the asset development team. So that's one sector. And again, we measure it by either a number of customers' expansion or adoption of users, which we have seen are quoted in my prepared remarks at 60% growth year-on-year. The second aspect is unlocking data, the vast amount of data that our industry manipulates, stores, manages and structured data, unstructured data to try to unlock this and democratize, if you like, AI. So we are fortunate to have a cloud-based solution, Delfi that has AI domain capability embedded into it, and we use it every day to help our customers unlock and get access to this AI capability. We have done at Innovation Factori, 100 solutions deployed. So that's the second engine of digital growth, if you like, is the data structure, data transformation and AI capability. And that's again, we are speaking about growing at above 50% for that subsegment of our digital offering. And last, and maybe the one that has the most growth potential that is untapped across the industry, digital operation. That's everywhere from well construction to producing assets. And that's why we deploy either some element of our cloud offering in drilling automation or in surveillance of assets or we deploy at the edge on the asset at the pump some device, and we call it the Agora Edge solution, which have embedded AI at the edge that do not need to run trips to the cloud to optimize these assets and give \u2013 and we use it and consume it in our APS assets to enhance the performance. So we are seeing the benefit of all these at the same time. They're all growing at a different pace, different adoption across the NOCs, the independents, all the IOCs. And it will be a long tail of growth that will clearly have a long durability and we continue to be a factor of secular trend in our industry to extract efficiency, low carbon productivity using this trend. So that's what we see, multiple engines of growth across multiple horizons. And with different technology where we have leadership in most and a footprint that allows us to tap into 1,500 customers for the long run. I would think there are several aspects to that. One obviously is the progress the industry at large has made in efficiency, integration, technology, performance at large that is getting the curve shifting to the left on drilling the cycle compressing on subsea and the overall development cycle to be more derisked to digital. So technology, integration, performance at large has helped the operator and the service industry to deliver faster and to deliver the lower total cost, the development of those assets. The second element, I would think is that exploration has been creating a portfolio of assets that can then been high-graded. And then the quality of the resource, the high quality of the geological play and lower carbon and better plays that have a better production and recovery potential, have also emerged and have been more favorably primed and/or, I would say, prioritized by our customers. So these customers have choice and they focus on the best and the most advantageous assets and the most advantageous geological basins as we have seen it from Brazil to Guyana, and we are seeing in the Middle East for some of the gas assets as well. So the third, I think, dimension that is, I think, accelerating in our opinion is what is called infrastructure-led development or infrastructure-led exploration and development, which make the returns on incremental oil, incremental gas from existing hubs from an existing platform, lower cost than in the past because the capability to infill tieback and expand from an existing platform, getting a better return on existing infrastructure. Hence, we have seen a significant improvement and significant increase on investment into this infill and tieback and ILX, and it is called infrastructure-led development, infrastructure-led exploration, and that's \u2013 this is another trend that is lowering the average cost of FID for increment of oil pool or additional gas. So you combine all of this and you are getting better economics, hence, better and sustained and higher durability for the long-term offshore play. Simply said, I think Russia revenue represented approximately 5% of our consolidated revenue in the second quarter and the decision that we have made last Friday to halt remaining shipments to Russia from all SLB facilities will not impact our financial guidance. So this decision will extend what you have seen as our previous ban on shipments from the locations that we had in the United States, the U.K., EU, Canada, into Russia, and we will continue to ensure that our remaining presence in Russia, meets and exceeds all international sanctions. Thank you. Good morning, Scott. Yes. Through 2024 in the trajectory we see in digital is not set to slow down because I think as I explained, multiple dimensions and trends are concurrently shaping the future of our digital success, and I think we expect it to continue well into the \u2013 beyond the cycle, as we call it, actually, and the accretive, I would say, contribution of digital will over time, long-term, be more and more accretive on the growth and more and more accretive on the margins. Absolutely. I think that's what we call agility and fit strategy in the land part of the North America has been helping us to shield ourselves from some of the macro trends. I think we believe that the lack of exposure to pressure pumping at scale and the fit-for-basin technology strategy, partly in well construction has allowed us to continue to progress or to buffer some other activity decline and expose us to actually the mix of performance that has been resilient in North America land and then complemented augmented, if I may, by the North America offshore, where we have seen activity and revenue progression. Thank you. Good afternoon, Kurt. No, I think it's a mix. It's a mix of \u2013 I think we and you have seen many contracts, some of them have very long duration, more than five years or seven years and recent award that we highlighted in April and this July. And I think it's three to five years is typical contract terms that we have every contract you see, framework contracts that are being used to mobilize resources and to commit capacity across multiple years, and these contracts either start this year or start next year. And they go well beyond 2025 and support the thesis of durability duration beyond mid this decade, and secondly, I would say that you see also that we were announcing a few of the subsea award, and we'll continue to see that in the second half. We quoted our total booking for Production Systems, which is the long cycle side of our business. So you have the contracts, I was referring to service contracts, three, five, seven years, and many of them in Middle East or offshore, as you have seen, and then you have the bookings that then have bookings that are than supporting two or three years of delivery, be it in subsea or bit in some of the large surface contract that you have seen in Qatar, Subsea, as you have seen in different parts of the Americas and \u2013 or Turkey. And this is typically two or three years out of booking, and we have been quoting $10 billion to $12 billion for the full-year on Production Systems, and we are confident this represents 1.1 to 1.3 book-to-bill ratio. And this, as we will exit 2023, we'll have this booking to fuel at least two years of growth going forward in our long-cycle business. So you combine these and you get many of the elements of duration on international, Middle East, and offshore markets. You're welcome. Hi, Neil. Yes. I think Production Systems is, as I said, is an equipment mostly product equipment and long cycle and on which we had suffered from some supply logistics constraints last year that we flagged, and we said at the onset as soon as this constraint will be behind us, we'll feel comfortable that the momentum on margin expansion will be matching what we have seen in the other core divisions that we have and this is starting to materialize. Our ambition is not stopping at this margin. Our long-term ambition is to continue to grow and expand in line with the overall core divisions as we believe that operating efficiency, including into this long cycle manufacturing efficiency, and the pricing environment for this unique technology we have from subsea to surface from completion to artificial lift or some process equipment that we are deploying across some offshore FPSO. All of this combines to give us the, I would say, the confidence that this trajectory of margin expansion will not stop here and will continue to grow. You have heard about the booking, I was commenting on this. It's a booking and margin expansion journey for PS going forward. I don't want to be too specific, obviously. I think I will reflect more on the general sentiment. I think the general sentiment is that first and foremost, energy security and capacity expansion still dominate the decision and the economics are seen as very favorable and the outlook of the industry at large is seen as resilient and you have seen it for many majors, reaffirming their 2030 production volume and adjusting their strategy to make sure they maximize the opportunity to either accelerate their gas transition or sustain their oil production. And this will mean investment, and we see that in all the engagement we have. And then the NOCs, be it in the Americas, in Africa, Middle East or Asia, pursuing the two things, either their production enhancement to make sure they continue to lift their production performance, and then addressing security \u2013 energy security through their gas development, typically. We see this everywhere, partly in Asia. So the customers are fairly focused on developing their gas assets, expanding and/or reverting some of the trends of declining oil production and to make sure they maximize the cycle, their participation to the cycle and their participation to the international pool \u2013 supply pool that is happening. So it's broad. And as I commented during our time together, I think I commented that we are seeing also many newcomers that are expanding into deepwater, into exploration rounds that are across the globe in new territories or in new countries, and this will attract more investment. This will attract, if the geology are right, future FID. So it's, in general, driven by energy security, pool of international supply, and IOCs' commitment to sustain their position towards the end of the decade. Thank you. Good morning. Yes. We typically do not speak ahead of any public announcements, the work we are doing on the ground to continue to prepare for further penetration of our existing customers. But yes, there are fairly advanced discussions with several customers to prepare for a transition and adoption of Delfi cloud solution, either for their geoscience workflow or for some of the drilling operations as I was referring to or for some of the adoption of AI and unlocking that data. So we are seeing this. And yes, you will see \u2013 you continue to see every quarter a new announcement that will come in the different, the three different dimension and trends that I was highlighting. And you will see large contract in the future, hopefully, materializing as well that will replicate the success we had with Chevron, who was the first very large enterprise deployment that many company are looking to towards and using to reflect some of their future opportunity they have with us. So that's happening at scale and we are pleased with progress. But again, it's a long journey and it's one customer at a time, and it will take years and the cycle will be long and will be accretive for the long run. Thank you Good morning, Keith. Yes. First, I think we \u2013 what we quoted at the time we announced the JV is that we expected this to close by Q3 this year, which is in two months from now. The progress we have made is that we have progressed towards obtaining the majority of the antitrust regulatory approval to move forward. We have progress in our planning in conjunction with our future partners and we'll be communicating on this as soon as we can to give you the materiality and the timing and the materiality of this as we will consolidate. Now it will be consolidated into the PS and into the revenue going forward at the time we will announce the closing, and we will give you the detailed information about that when it will be announced, and we'll give clarity on the way we will report it. So good progress across the different jurisdiction and good progress, very good progress on the planning to prepare for the closing as well. So we're optimistic towards the near future. Thank you, Leah. Ladies and gentlemen, as we conclude today's call, I would like to leave you with the following takeaways: First, as our second quarter results clearly demonstrate, our market position, performance differentiation, and technology leadership are fit for the cycle and will continue to drive our financial performance. Second, as upstream investments accelerate in the international and offshore markets, these regions will lead our growth and lay a strong foundation for ongoing outperformance in the years ahead. Third, following a solid first half and with significant visibility into the second half of the year, we reaffirm our confidence in our full-year financial targets. This is a compelling environment for our company, and today we are more returns-focused, disciplined, and efficient than ever before. We could not ask for a better backdrop to execute our commitment to shareholder returns. I remain very confident in our strategy and fully trust the SLB team to continue delivering strong performance for our business. With this, I will conclude today's call. Thank you all for joining."

Later, there will be an opportunity for your questions. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations ND Maduemezia. Please go ahead.\nND Maduemezia: Thank you, Leah. Good morning, and welcome to the SLB first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Today's call is being hosted from Rio, Brazil, following our Board meeting, held earlier this week. Joining us on the call are Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Executive Officer; and Stephane Biguet, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind all participants that some of the statements we will be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10K filing and our other SEC filings. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our first quarter press release, which is on our website. With that, I will turn the call over to Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, ND. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on the call today. In my prepared remarks, I will cover three topics. I will begin with an update on our first quarter results; then, I will share our latest view on the macro and our positioning for long-term success; and finally, I will close with our outlook for the second quarter and full year. Stephane will then provide more details on our financial results, and we will open for your questions. It has been a great start of the year as we achieved results that set us on a solid footing for our full\u00adyear financial ambitions. On a year-on-year basis, our financial and operational results were strong across all geographies and Divisions. Following the remarks that are shared in our earnings release this morning, I would like to emphasize a few key highlights from the quarter. First, we delivered very solid year-on-year growth at a magnitude last seen more than a decade ago. Geographically, year -on-year growth rates in North America and internationally were comparable. More importantly, the rate of change is tilting more in favor of the international markets, where sequentially we experienced the smallest seasonal decline in recent times. Collectively, our Core divisions grew year-on-year by more than 30% and expanded operating margins by more than 300 basis points. We continue to position the core for long term success with significant contract wins and technology innovations that improve efficiency and lower carbon emissions. A great example is EcoShield, a geopolymer based cement-free well-integrity system and one of our latest Transition Technologies launched earlier this quarter. You will find many examples of these contract wins and the performance impact of our new technologies in today's press release. In Digital, we maintained strong growth momentum and also secured more contract wins. At a Division level, the amount of year-on-year revenue growth in Digital was somewhat masked by significantly lower APS revenue due to production interruptions in Ecuador and lower project revenue in the Palliser asset in Canada. Additionally, Digital continues to help us elevate our efficiency and margin performance in the Core, as we deploy these solutions at scale in our global operations. And in New Energy, we continue to make progress across our portfolio, notably with new Carbon Capture and Sequestration activities that raise our involvement to around 30 projects globally. CCS is recognized as one of the fastest-growing opportunities to reduce carbon emissions, and with the tailwinds from the US Inflation Reduction Act and other initiatives around the world, we expect more projects to move forward to final investment decisions in the next few years. Finally, we are delivering on our commitment to increase returns to shareholders. During the quarter, we relaunched our share buyback program, with repurchases totaling more than $200 million worth of shares. I would like to really thank the entire SLB team for their hard work and for delivering yet another successful quarter. Moving to the macro, we maintain a constructive multiyear growth outlook. Through the first quarter, the resilience, breadth, and durability of the upcycle have only become more evident. I would like to take a few minutes to describe these factors. To begin, the underlying demand, investments, and activity during this cycle are resilient, despite short-term economic and demand uncertainties. The combination of energy security, the initiation of long-cycle projects, and OPEC\u2019s policy, sets the conditions for a de-coupling of the activity outlook from short-term uncertainties. Indeed, energy security remains a top priority for most countries, and is driving structural investments that are governed primarily by national interests. The extent of these investments is resulting into a broad-ranging growth outlook, comprised predominantly of resilient long-cycle projects in the Middle East, the international offshore basins, and in gas projects. Collectively, we expect these market segments to reach or exceed more than two-thirds of the total global upstream spend and support a long tail of resilient activity over the next few years. In parallel, the North America market, characterized by higher short-cycle exposure, is also set to benefit from positive demand outlook and supportive commodity pricing. However, this will be impacted by an anticipated activity plateau in the short term, which will subsequently be reflected in production volumes. Moving to the dimensions of breadth and duration, these are also best emphasized by the latest activity outlook for the Middle East and Offshore market segments. Fundamentally, the pivot to both segments as anchors of supply growth is a defining attribute of this cycle. This is providing an unprecedented level of investment visibility and a scale that is setting many records. In the Middle East, the largest ever investment cycle has now commenced. This will support ongoing capacity expansion projects over the next four years, in both oil and gas. Consequently, this year we expect to post our highest revenue ever in the Middle East putting us on track to achieve our multi-year growth aspirations. Simultaneously, we are witnessing further activity expansion in the offshore markets. Offshore activity continues to surprise to the upside, with breadth and a diversity of opportunities across all major basins. In addition, the latest FID projections and industry reports indicate that the offshore sector is set for its highest growth in a decade, with more than $200 billion in new projects through the next two years. This growth will be supported by three layers of activity: First, the resumption of infill and tieback activity in mature basins, which was very visible across Africa in 2022. This will continue to strengthen in multiple geographies from this year onwards. Second, ongoing large development projects in both and oil and gas that are ramping-up and starting to scale. This is evident in Latin America such as in Guyana and Brazil, and in the Middle East such as in Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Qatar. And third, the resurgence of exploration and appraisal activity, which is starting to gather strong momentum in existing basins and new frontiers. From West & South Africa to the East Mediterranean, we are starting to see exploration and appraisal at a pace that was unforeseen just a few months ago. Additionally, the activity pipeline continues to elongate with new licensing rounds and new blocks awarded. As a result, we believe that we will continue to witness durable offshore investment for many years to come. Let me spend a couple of minutes highlighting what this means for SLB. As the cycle unfolds, the characteristics I have described continue to align with major strengths in our Core. This will support additional activity intensity for Well Construction; accelerated growth opportunities in Reservoir Performance through the return of Exploration & Appraisal activity; and further long-term growth potential for Production Systems. One such example is the TPAO Sakarya project in the Southern Black Sea offshore Turkey. This project involved all our Core Divisions supporting the development of a challenging subsea gas asset and the simultaneous construction of a gas production facility, demonstrating SLB's unique ability to integrate at scale, from Pore-to-Process. Looking more in-depth, our Production Systems Division is in a unique position as a long-cycle lever of growth for us with quarterly year-on-year results demonstrating our ability to fully harness its potential. We believe momentum is set to continue, benefiting from our strong market presence in the Middle East, and in the Offshore basins. In this Division, we anticipate cumulative bookings in the range of $10 billion to $12 billion in 2023, up significantly from 2022. We have taken a strong step forward towards this ambition with more than $3 billion in bookings in the first quarter, and the outlook supports continued strong bookings through at least 2025. Overall, this will provide durable revenue growth and a significant installed base for services in the years to come. In this context, our exposure to the Deepwater subsea market remains an essential component of our growth opportunity, and we continue to strengthen this part of our portfolio with much success. In Subsea, we have grown 20% over the last two years and are already generating EBITDA margins in the high teens, building on our technology, performance in execution, and the depth of our processing portfolio. We expect strong momentum for this part of our business to be sustained through 2025 and beyond. To conclude, we are in the midst of a unique cycle with qualities that enhance the long-term outlook for our industry-Resilience, Breadth, and Durability-all reinforced by a pivot to the Middle-East, Offshore, Gas, and a return of E&A. We could not ask for a better backdrop to execute our returns-focused strategy. During the early phase of this cycle, led by North America, our results have already demonstrated our ability to capture growth ahead of activity and expand margins visibly beyond pre-pandemic levels. Looking forward, we are positioned to fully harness the International and Offshore momentum that is now underway, and to further our margins expansion journey. In the quarters ahead, we will continue to demonstrate our returns focus, capital discipline, and commitment to shareholder returns. I am truly excited about the outlook for SLB. Next, I would like to comment on our progress over the shorter term. For the full year, our strong first quarter gives us renewed confidence in our financial ambitions for 2023. We are primed for revenue growth and margin expansion through the year, underpinned by a very solid international outlook. In North America, we still expect tangible market growth but at a lower rate than originally anticipated at the start of the year, mainly as a result of ongoing weakness in gas prices. Taken together, we expect the strong international growth to offset any weakness in North America keeping our full year ambitions intact, with year-on-year growth in excess of 15%, which would support adjusted EBITDA growth in the mid-twenties. More specific to the second quarter. Directionally, we expect revenue to grow about mid-to-high single digits with operating margins expanding by 50 to 100 basis points driven by a seasonal rebound in the International markets. Growth will be led by the Middle East & Asia Area, and continued momentum in the offshore markets. Building on this, we expect our second quarter adjusted EBITDA to reach new highs in this cycle, further extending the earnings growth journey we initiated 11quarters ago and taking another positive step towards achieving our full year ambitions. I will now turn the call over to Stephane.\nStephane Biguet: Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. First quarter earnings per share excluding charges and credits was $0.63. This represents an increase of $0.29, or 85%, when compared to the first quarter of last year. In addition, during the first quarter we recorded a $0.02 gain relating to the sale of all of our remaining shares in Liberty, which brought our GAAP EPS to $0.65. Overall, our first quarter revenue of $7.7 billion increased 30% year-on-year as the growth cycle continues to unfold. This represents the highest quarterly year -on-year increase in more than a decade. International revenue was up 29% year-on-year, while North America increased 32%. Company-wide adjusted EBITDA margin for the first quarter was 23.1%. In absolute dollars, adjusted EBITDA increased 43% year-on-year. As a reminder, our ambition is for adjusted EBITDA to grow, in percentage terms, in the mid\u00ad 20s for the full year of 2023. The first quarter was certainly a strong start towards achieving this goal. On a sequential basis, revenue decreased 2%, mostly driven by seasonally lower revenue in Asia and Russia as well as lower APS revenue in Ecuador. Russia represented approximately 5% of our consolidated Q1 revenue. Sequentially, our pretax segment operating margins declined 178 basis points largely due to seasonality and lower APS revenue. From a year-on-year perspective, margins expanded 298 basis points with significant margin growth in three of our four Divisions. Let me now go through the first quarter results for each Division. First quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $894 million decreased 12% sequentially with margins declining 8 percentage points to 30%. These decreases were primarily due to lower APS project revenue and seasonally lower digital and exploration data licensing sales. The APS revenue decline was mostly a result of a pipeline disruption in Ecuador that temporarily reduced production and lower commodity prices impacting our project in Canada. As a result of these issues, APS revenue declined year-on-year, but this effect was more than offset by strong digital growth, including a more than 50% increase in our cloud and edge solutions. Margins for the Digital & Integration division are expected to improve in Q2 as the pipeline issue in Ecuador has been resolved and as digital sales will increase sequentially in line with the usual seasonal trend. Reservoir Performance revenue of $1.5 billion decreased 3% sequentially while margins declined 207 basis points to 16.1%. These decreases were primarily due to seasonal activity reductions in Europe and Asia and lower revenue in Russia. Year-on-year, revenue grew 24% and margins increased 291 basis points driven by strong growth internationally, both on land and offshore. Well Construction revenue of $3.3 billion increased 1% sequentially, while margins of 20.6% decreased 44 basis points. However, year-on-year revenue grew 36% while margins expanded 444 basis points with very strong growth across all Areas on higher activity, increased pricing and a favorable technology mix. Finally, Production Systems revenue of $2.2 billion was essentially flat sequentially and margins declined 148 basis points to 9.3% due to seasonality and the activity mix in Europe and Asia. Year-on-year, revenue increased 38%, while margins expanded 217 basis points driven by strong activity across all areas led by Europe, Latin America, and North America. Margins also improved compared to the first quarter of last year as supply chain and logistics constraints continued to ease. Now turning to our liquidity. Our net debt increased approximately $1 billion sequentially to $10.3 billion. During the quarter, we generated $330 million of cash flow from operations and negative free cash flow of $265 million reflecting the seasonal increase in working capital we typically experience in the first quarter. This largely reflects the payout of our annual employee incentives and the build\u00adup of working capital that will support our anticipated growth throughout the year. Our second quarter free cash flow is expected to be materially higher and to continue to increase into the third and fourth quarters. Capital investments, inclusive of CapEx and investments in APS projects and exploration data were $595 million in the first quarter. For the full year, we are still expecting capital investments to be approximately $2.5 to $2.6 billion. During the quarter, we monetized our remaining investment in Liberty, which resulted in net proceeds of $137 million. We also spent $244 million, net of cash acquired, on acquisitions and investments in other businesses, the majority of which relates to the Gyrodata acquisition. Finally, we resumed our stock repurchase program and repurchased 4.4 million shares during the quarter for a total purchase price of $230 million. We will continue to repurchase shares in the coming quarters and, as previously announced, we are targeting to return a total of $2 billion dollars to our shareholders this year between dividends and stock buybacks. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Stephane. Ladies and gentlemen, I think we will open now the floor to your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We go to the line of James West with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nJames West: Good morning. Olivier, you and Stephane, you outlined kind of an unprecedented, quite frankly, amount of contract awards, amount of visibility into the cycle. And curious, as you talk to your customers now, what you see as the durability of those awards, given the global volatility in economies and things of that nature. How are you thinking about the next several years? How are you guys perceiving kind of the steadiness of these contract awards and their ability to continue to go forward, even if we were to have a recession or something like that? And how that would influence your revenue and results?\nOlivier Le Peuch: No, James, thank you. I think indeed, I think we have highlighted and I think in my prepared remarks, I shared the view that in the recent months and certainly in last quarter and I have been traveling in Asia, Middle East and South America. I have seen a customer, I think, taking commitments and being ready to commit to the supply capacity and to the partnership they need to deploy and develop the assets going forward as we believe this cycle is unique through, as we said, element of resilience by the nature of investment at growth rate, including the long-term capacity expansion committed in Middle East, including the large long-cycle elements that are growing in proportion led by offshore deepwater coming back. The breadth, I think everywhere we go, everybody needs - is seeing a customer reaching out to mobilize resource, sometimes for short-cycle production enhancements, most of the time for development commitment of assets and redevelopment expansion from infield to large-scale development. And durability is certainly improving and duration of the cycle, I think, is improving as we see because beyond the Middle East, '27 targets of capital expansion from -- for in the country. Other countries are targeting this towards the end of the decade. And here in the city in Brazil, Brazil has a clear ambition for 4 million barrel by 2030, and I've already committed up to 20 FPSO contract that will continue to build the pipeline of offshore activity subsea in particular going forward. So I'm very positive about the mix, if you like, of short cycle on production enhancements to address the anticipated supply super risk and the commitment -- long commitment from Middle East, from deepwater and offshore operator to complement the long cycle is not to offset and now take precedent over this short cycle and so turn, as we indicated, a turn into the cycle towards international offshore and Middle East in particular. So that's where we are very confident.\nJames West: Okay. That's perfect, Olivier. And then a follow-up for me. In terms of pricing, international and offshore versus maybe North America, kind of what you're seeing there in terms of the level of concern or maybe not concern but level of willingness to accept pricing increases. It seems to me like customers internationally and offshore more looking at or concerned about availability of service capacity rather than what it actually costs.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yes. I think the -- we are seeing pricing tailwinds and we have seen pricing tailwinds in the global market for quite a few quarters and starting in North America. It has turned to international based on two things: first, indeed, securing capacity going forward, giving us -- giving -- considering the tight supply of equipment, unique technology, giving a level of sense of urgency to secure contract and elongating the contract. You have seen example of nine years contract into the announcement we made today. And at the same time, I think performance matters. Performance matters to offshore operator. Performance matters for first gas, first oil. And there's a sense of urgency to accelerate the cycle. This is one of the priorities. And technology integration also makes a difference and is recognized and is driving a pricing premium. So the combination of supply capacity, the combination of, I would say, a sense of urgency for -- and quest for performance integration and technology deployment is driving pricing tailwinds that are serving us very well.\nJames West: Great. Thanks Oliver.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we go to David Anderson with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nDavid Anderson: Hi, good morning, Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Good morning, Dave.\nDavid Anderson: So question on kind of the duration of the cycle in your core business. Well Construction is obviously a big part of that. I was hoping maybe you could talk about the pace of well construction that you see in front of you this year? And where you should see the greatest uptick in activity and kind of the greatest shift in technology as well? Noticed that North America was up 9% sequentially, which is a bit of a surprise. But where does that Middle East ramp--up fit in here? And kind of also a similar question to what James meant, question of capacity. If I'm one of your customers, what am I most worried about today? Is it Well Construction? Is that kind of the -- I would have to think that has to be on kind of towards the top of the list. But that -- and if you can sort of help us understand that a little bit. Thank you.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yes. No, I think you are correct. I think the supply of high-performance equipment in the Well Construction domain is under stretch today. And I think we are working very closely with our customers to prioritize equipment, price technology application and use integration, use digital to help deliver the performance they expect. So there is a stretch indeed in this. But going forward, I think we are committing the resource when we see the returns to be accretive to our margins and align with our expectation and ambition to continue to expand margins. So where we see the most activity, clearly, this year is an uptick and this will be the case as sequentially next quarter is in Middle East and offshore. A combination of an integrated contract we have in offshore with relatively complex assets on occasion that demands a lot of technology deployments. And the intensity of activity in Middle East, that is a mix of short-cycle and long-cycle development project, this combination is unique and I think will be putting more resource, more equipment, more technology and will drive revenue forward up.\nDavid Anderson: And was the North America uptick, was that more offshore-driven than onshore this quarter?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yes, it was, indeed, absolutely. I think offshore is not only international, I think offshore is happening in North America. North America as northeast Canada, Alaska offshore and go from Mexico, the combination of which is set to grow and our pace this year, the -- I would say, the U.S. land and North America (NAM) activity. So we are also getting the benefit of our fit for basin success in North America that continues to hold and help us maintain, grow our share and come on a premium on pricing.\nDavid Anderson: And then, Olivier, in the D&I business, APS obviously impacted the performance this quarter. I was wondering maybe you could kind of pull back a little bit and help us understand how the Digital business is performing. I think the goal is at a $3 billion revenue target. Wondering if you can kind of tell us where we are now in terms of that run rate. And in order to hit those targets, I'm just curious, is that about your existing customers using Digital more? Is it adding more apps to DELFI? Is it adding more customers? Is it all of the above? Maybe help us understand a little bit more...\nOlivier Le Peuch: All of the above.\nDavid Anderson: Digital. I had a feeling you would say that.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Indeed. But I think, indeed, Dave, I think first, in this quarter, obviously, the growth, and we have seen growth rate in Digital that is aligned with our expectations, aligned with our ambition to double revenue from 2021 to 2025. We have seen, as Stephane mentioned, during his prepared remarks that the new technology edge and cloud is growing at more than 50%, continuing on the trajectory that we have set in the last couple of years. And we don't see any sign of this slowing down. And indeed, expansion will come from multiple dimension. Obviously, getting more consumption from the existing customer we have. And we are today deploying one of the largest contractor in Petrobras, where we were and we are meeting with the team here, very satisfied deployment and growing number of users. That's an axis then growing number of applications, and that's where we want to deploy and go beyond geoscience, our petrotechnical suite, if you like, to digital operation, production and digital operation into the drilling domain, automating the full rig well construction process. And again, in Brazil, we are very pleased to meet with Equinor and look after the Peregrinoplatform, we're about to deploy for the first time in the world a full automated top side to bottom assembly, fully automated autonomous digital journey that we'll realize this year. So we have both the geoscience application deployment, the digital operation, and we have new customers coming in, and you have seen some new contracts that we announced this quarter. So we are growing to the pace we are expecting to be our trajectory to double. And in this quarter, this was unfortunately masked fully by the APS setback, but we expect this to resume and to be actually one of the leading growth sequential that you would see in the second quarter.\nDavid Anderson: Fantastic. Thank you.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we go to the line of Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nChase Mulvehill: Good morning, Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Good morning, Chase.\nChase Mulvehill: So a quick question. I guess coming back to international and just kind of focusing there. We get questions on this international ramp. And because the last six months, we've seen some oil price volatility. We've seen a couple of OPEC+ cuts. And so we kind of get a lot of investor questions if there's been any signs of OPEC slowing down, any kind of planned projects or CapEx plans. So let me just ask you if you've seen any indications of OPEC+ members slowing things down at all in the Middle East.\nOlivier Le Peuch: No, we have not seen it. We have not seen any impact of businesses, and we don't believe there will be any we believe that these companies and the national companies are really set and fully focused on mobilizing resource to execute their very ambitious capacity expansion plan. I think you are aware all the commitments. And it's not only UAE and Saudi. This is across many countries in GCC. And I think this is to grow both oil capacity and also gas and commercial and gas across the region. So I think I have -- I've been recently in the Middle East and have not seen any sign of and challenging. And again, the multiplicity of contract awards that were tendered in the last 18 months and most of them multiyear, if not beyond five years, are really indicative of the commitment and the capacity expansion plan that have started. Inflection has happened and you will see this growing for the rest of the year. So we don't foresee any impact.\nChase Mulvehill: Okay, awesome. Appreciate the color there. The follow-up is really kind of on CCUS. You had a lot of announcements in your press release, which really highlighted your experience on the sequestration side. But there are other parts, obviously, of the value chain. And are there other parts that you would actually think that would be a good fit for SLB, like possibly the capture technology side?\nOlivier Le Peuch: No, absolutely. I think we have indeed a unique right of play into the sequestration that have translated into a significant number of studies and services and modeling and digital that we have provided to a lot of customers. And these customers have approached us to participate, some of them emitters, that are non-oil and gas as you have seen some of the examples we gave in the press release earlier today. And then we are using our technology and innovation capability to explore and to invest into capture technology or to partner as we are partnering with Linde into the application of CCS project across the domain of blue hydrogen and ammonia for decarbonizing the natural gas, ammonia and halogen production. So we are indeed either associating or investing into capture technology, hence broadening our scope beyond sequestration and using our right of play to expand and create a business that will stand on its own in the years to come.\nChase Mulvehill: Okay. Awesome. Appreciate the color there. I'll turn it back over. Thanks Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Chase.\nOperator: Next, we go to the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nArun Jayaram: Olivier, I wanted to get some insights on what you're seeing within the Subsea segment of Production System. I think you highlighted broadly within Production Systems, $10 billion to $12 billion of backlog growth potential this year or bookings potential. I was wondering if you could maybe characterize SLB's technology offering and integration capabilities relative to your peers as well as provide any update on the strategic transaction that you announced last summer.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yes. Let me take it at the level of Production System first and let me give a quick zoom. So the booking we are talking about is at the Production System level, which is the division encompassing our production system equipment capability from Subsea, as you pointed out, from actually in well completion, in well actually, subsea surface system processing capabilities. So when you put all of this together, you get an end-to-end from port to process, from send phase to processing that is quite unique in integration and delivery capability, hence, the opportunity we have to participate at scale and be a provider with our partner, Subsea 7, into the product of TPAO that you heard about where the first gas to flare was realized yesterday and celebrated by the -- in country. And this is quite unique so that's differentiated. We have end-to-end integration capability. We can design and deploy and develop a gas facility, and we have done this in the past and we can link it to with our partners to our subsea development and participate to the completion architecture. So this end-to-end is quite unique and give us opportunity to participate at a large scale into development. Now very specific to Subsea, I think we are also quite differentiated into the way that we can connect to the subsurface and we have this integration capability from the sub to the completion architecture. And one thing in particular I would like to highlight or two things. First is the electrical capability of transforming this Subsea 3, the subsea control and the subsea and well completion control into electric -- full electric capability. This is a game changer for the deepwater industry, game changer for low carbon and control -- digital control of subsea equipment and control of zone equipment and completion. This is very much again the case in Brazil. We are very fortunate to have established here a unique center of excellence, and we have, under the sponsorship of A&P working with multiple operators that have joined us into a joint development program where we are deploying and we will soon deploy everything from subsidiary to septic valve to flow control valve, fully electric, that would change the game and creating a new step. So that's differentiated. With differential obviously are processing, boosting and processing capability. You remember the award that we got last year into Shell for gas processing subsea equipment into a large installation in -- and you have seen two awards this quarter in Brazil, highlighting our boosting capabilities. So we're unique into that position. And again, ability we have to integrate processing equipment subsea with the rest of equipment well or surface is unique. And that's something that is adding to our digital capability as well. So when it comes to the announced JV, I think we are seeing the process of going to the regulatory bodies in different parts of the world so I cannot comment any further than what we commented earlier. This is an exciting outlook, exciting opportunity. But until close, we'll move forward.\nArun Jayaram: Great. Olivier, my follow-up. You and the Board are in Rio this week. I was wondering if you could characterize on what you're seeing on the ground in terms of the upstream spending picture. And obviously, we've had a regime change recently with the new administration. Are you seeing any potential changes to the fiscal or regulatory regime that could impact spending over the next couple two, three years?\nOlivier Le Peuch: If anything, this visit has been outstanding, outstanding for the Board, outstanding for engagement we have customers and clearly highlighting the potential of Brazil to be fulfilling a significant supply growth. In the future, as I said, A&P and Brazil has ambition to reach or exceed 4 billion barrel from 3.3 billion today, I mean, on barrel per day. And they have already laid out the foundation of this of both production enhancement into the basin, the basin or the land basins and accelerating -- continue to accelerate the development of the sub-salt deepwater with up to 20 FPSO already into the play. So I think they also are pushing forward to the next frontier. They are about to explore Ecuador margin that give us another leg, if you like, of Brazil growth in the future beyond the already committed multi-year FPSO contract that are in place. So we don't see any change. If anything, we see an acceleration and extension of the duration of this Brazil outlook. And if I had to highlight one noticeable change that I've seen, a commitment to decarbonize, a commitment to digitalize that I think is the new -- the leadership is recommitted to. We have seen it and you will see it in the future. Digital operation will accelerate in Brazil by the main operator here. And the country will accelerate this commitment to CCS. We are very fortunate to be on the first and only bioenergy CCS project in Latin America with FS Bioenergia. And we met the team two days ago, and they are very pleased the progress we are making on the CCS product in Brazil. So you will see more activity and no slowdown, but any upside -- only upside to the offshore environment and then a low carbon and digital transition accelerating as well.\nArun Jayaram: Great. Thanks for the detailed comments.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we go to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNeil Mehta: Good morning, team. First question was around cash flow and working capital specifically was a bigger outflow than we had modeled in the quarter. Does that all reverse over the course of the year and you could talk about some of the moving pieces around that?\nStephane Biguet: Sure, Neil. So yes, it does reverse. As you know, Q1 is always the lowest quarter of the year for free cash flow. As mentioned, we have the typical working capital buildup. Particularly, we have the payout of annual employee incentives. This is a one-off. It was about $500 million in the first quarter. And then we build inventory for anticipated growth, particularly in the Production System division, as we've mentioned. So even though it was -- it remained negative, the free cash flow actually came slightly ahead of our own expectations. Our DSO was the lowest historically for a first quarter so we were quite happy with that. So yes, it will increase in the second quarter and it will accelerate in the second half on higher EBITDA, continuous capital discipline and working capital unwinding. Keeping in mind, we typically generate the majority of our annual cash flow in H2, but it will increase materially in Q2. So when you put it all together, the 2023 full year free cash flow will be significantly higher than last year. And clearly, on the trajectory to deliver the 10% free cash flow margin we committed for the 2021 to 2025 period. And just to close, this will allow us to, as Olivier mentioned and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, to return $2 billion to shareholders in the form of dividend and buybacks together.\nNeil Mehta: That's really helpful. The follow-up is just the margins at Digital. I think it's hard to isolate because of some of the volatility around APS. Can you give us a sense of how you're seeing the underlying margin trends at the core Digital business? And in Q2, that segment margin progression, I would imagine, strengthens as you work through some of these Ecuador challenges.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yes. So as a reminder for everyone, I think our Digital & Integration division, I think, comprise and combines digital and exploration data with our Asset Performance Solutions. So at the onset of our digital journey, we have set clear ambition for Digital margin to be highly accretive to SLB, at the same time, to accelerate growth to double our revenue from '21 to '25. We are on that journey and clearly delivering a very accretive margin to SLB. So now we have demonstrated in the last few quarters last year that we -- when we leverage best performance in APS and our differentiated digital offering, we deliver DLM margin visibly in excess of 30%. Now notwithstanding similar setback as we had material setback in APS ambition for D&I as a combination is to continue to deliver highly accretive margins, certainly in the 30s. So going forward, we expect the margins of D&I to sequentially improve based on the very solid revenue growth from Digital and very accretive margin for digital, combined with a return of growth for APS and returning a decent margin for APS. So as a whole, we're expecting to not only revenue increase but margin expand in sequentially and to continue to be accretive -- highly accretive for the rest of the year.\nNeil Mehta: All right. Great. Thanks team.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you.\nStephane Biguet: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we go to the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nScott Gruber: Yes, good morning.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Good morning, Scott.\nScott Gruber: Good morning. Olivier, you mentioned the resurgence in exploration, which is great to hear for SLB. One concern out there though is the potentially limited number of experienced geologists across the customer base to prosecute the exploration programs just because G&G departments were definitely scaled down during the pandemic. Is this a legitimate constraint on the strength of the exploration cycle? Or is this capability being rebuilt across the industry? What are you seeing on that front?\nOlivier Le Peuch: No, I will not be overly concerned by this. I think there are two factors that are playing into this. The first at Digital, I think, is having a significant productivity gain for processing, analyzing and generating prospects, as we call it, from -- from modeling, from structural modeling to prospect identification, the seismic data set as well as the capability to process using digital capability has significantly improved. So the ability to create spotlight on the gas line or the oil pools, I think, is better than it's ever been and certainly much better than last cycle. And secondly, I think there is a significant service consulting capability that we participate into that can help complement and provide support to our customers. But I would say, digital, productivity, technology that has improved and give higher accuracy, better geology interpretation capability, better structural modeling from seismic to wireline, and to modeling or to sampling like our ORA [reservoir] samplingtechnology, all combine to give a significant support to the G&G team of our customers and to not a slowdown but actually accelerate and improve the productivity and ability to generate prospects. So I'm not concerned. And I believe that you will see this prospect be fast-tracked from exploration to appraisal to development going forward.\nScott Gruber: That's great. And just how would you compare the strength of this exploration cycle? So those are the path. Is the trajectory trending us back towards that 2011 to 2014 period? Could we possibly get back to the mid-to late 2000s levels just as tieback opportunities are consumed? Just some color on the potential strength of this exploration cycle relative to history would be great.\nOlivier Le Peuch: So I think I will contrast it more by saying the type of activity in exploration that is happening. And I think there are a lot of near-field exploration as it is called or backyard exploration that is being used by the most operators that have gained access to critical asset, critical basin or advantaged assets and they want to explore and do near-field exploration across and beyond and use tieback. So there is a lot of exploration happening across every basin, major basin that characterize this and has been -- this trend has been going up. And this trend is certainly different from the greenfield, frontier exploration that characterized maybe the last cycle. However, this cycle, I think, beyond the near-field exploration, we are seeing a return of frontier exploration, driven by energy security, driven by the desire to replace reserves and to secure new gas particularly, and we see it happening across many basins. I mentioned before the equatorial margin as one. You heard about, obviously, continuous exploration, which is almost becoming a near-field exploration across Guyana. But if you go across the Atlantic, you will find a lot of exploration happening in the south part of Africa, gave some huge success for two or three operator into Namibia that are here on the onset of something that could be very significant for the industry in oil development. And then gas in East Med, I think, has been developing, and you heard about the development that we helped fast-track on the Black Sea. That was also gas. So security is incentivizing people to invest and operator to invest into certain regions with access to the demand market and near-field is continuing to grow very well. So in combination, it's different from the past and I will not try to compare the scale but I think the quality of this exploration and the diversity in terms of customers and interval basin is quite unique and is really accelerating this year.\nScott Gruber: I appreciate the color. Thank you.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we go to the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nRoger Read: Yes, thank you. And I imagine good afternoon in Rio. Maybe just to come back to the exploration appraisal kind of question. You mentioned that earlier, slowdown in North America offset or more than offset by what's going on in E&A. So I was just curious what -- and I think you also mentioned it had materially improved in the last couple of months. What you think really has led to this increase in E&A because it's not as if commodity prices weren't good in '22, right? And they haven't been something exceptional thus far in '23. So is it a change in just how your customers are looking at their future inventories? Or is there something else that's helping to drive this improvement?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think the energy security, the supporting commodity price outlook and the desire indeed to go and leverage the cycle to explore and to tie back reserve to the existing advantage basin or to fast-track gas or new oil pools as I described earlier. Now the timing of it, the acceleration, I think, is linked more to the availability of -- and the contracting of deepwater rigs or the contracting of rigs offshore or land on some occasion when it is -- when this exploration is happening. More than yes, but the cycle has started last year of E&A return is accelerating in line to some extent, with the offshore acceleration. And I think it will be part of the mix and will give an opportunity to extend and create a new leg of activity and a new leg of FID in two or three years from now when those exploration will have been appraised and will be FID at that time. So I think it's more -- it's an underlying trend that have started in the last few quarters and have accelerated. And I think that is a more long view that customers are taking and not looking at the short-term uncertainty or short-term commodity price variation and committing on one new basin or committing on expanding near-field exploration. So that's the way we have seen it.\nRoger Read: Okay. So maybe just the natural evolution within a cycle, I mean, as things get some duration, you would expect the exploration to pick up. One other question for you, just APS, so obviously, kind of highlighted had some issues. Looking back over the last couple of years, there's been talk of potentially disposing of these assets or at least not investing in them aggressively. I was just curious, it seems like M&A has picked up or at least talk of it within the E&P sector. So more likely, less likely, same to look for a way to exit these assets as you go forward?\nStephane Biguet: So look, Roger, on EPS, we really have to distinguish Ecuador. These are service contracts, tariff-based. There's no intention to exit. And we do need to maintain a minimum level of investment. But rest assured, these projects are highly positive in terms of not only earnings but cash flow. The Canada asset is a bit different. This is a pure equity position. And it's also very accretive in terms of cash flow even at current commodity prices. And as you know, we ran a process on that particular asset last year. We were not satisfied with the offers we received. So at the moment, we are happy with keeping that asset and the cash flow it generates. But if one day, there is an offer at the right price, we'll certainly consider it.\nRoger Read: Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOlivier Le Peuch: So ladies and gentlemen, I think I want to give a close to this call. It's almost to the hour. So to conclude today's call, I would like to leave you with the following takeaways. First, the quality of the unfolding upcycle in oil and gas is improving, with unique attributes of resilience, breadth and duration. This is very much evidenced by the strengthening outlook in both Middle East and offshore markets and further reinforced by the tight supply balance as demand forecast approach new highs at year-end. Second, our strong start of the year gives us further confidence in our full year financial ambition. Directionally, the dynamics in international markets will likely offset the moderation of activity growth in North America. In fact, we are witnessing a gradual shift from short-to long-cycle investment and a further transition to international, with both effects closely aligned with our strengths and paving the way for an exciting outlook for years to come. Third, our overall performance demonstrates the strength of our portfolio, focused on the most attractive and resilient market segments globally, both in oil and gas and low-carbon solutions. Our divisions continue to align with customers at most priorities on value delivered to performance and integration, with digital transformation and decarbonization as industry mandates. Additionally, pricing continues to trend positively, enabling us to extract more value for our products and services. As a result, we reaffirm our ambition to further expand margins as the cycle unfolds, to grow earnings to new levels in this cycle and to significantly increase returns to shareholders as further demonstrated this quarter. I remain very confident in the alignment of our strategy to formal trends in the energy market and fully trust the SLB team to continue outperforming in this context. Now before I close, I wanted to announce that ND Maduemezia will be moving to a new career opportunity in SLB after remarkable stands in his position as Investor Relations VP for the past three years. Thank you, ND, for the support and positive engagement with our investors and market analysts. Replacing ND is James McDonald, who is transitioning from his previous role as Americas Land Basin President. Welcome, James. With this, I want to close today's call and wish you all the best. Thank you. Good day, everyone.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. First quarter earnings per share excluding charges and credits was $0.63. This represents an increase of $0.29, or 85%, when compared to the first quarter of last year. In addition, during the first quarter we recorded a $0.02 gain relating to the sale of all of our remaining shares in Liberty, which brought our GAAP EPS to $0.65. Overall, our first quarter revenue of $7.7 billion increased 30% year-on-year as the growth cycle continues to unfold. This represents the highest quarterly year -on-year increase in more than a decade. International revenue was up 29% year-on-year, while North America increased 32%. Company-wide adjusted EBITDA margin for the first quarter was 23.1%. In absolute dollars, adjusted EBITDA increased 43% year-on-year. As a reminder, our ambition is for adjusted EBITDA to grow, in percentage terms, in the mid\u00ad 20s for the full year of 2023. The first quarter was certainly a strong start towards achieving this goal. On a sequential basis, revenue decreased 2%, mostly driven by seasonally lower revenue in Asia and Russia as well as lower APS revenue in Ecuador. Russia represented approximately 5% of our consolidated Q1 revenue. Sequentially, our pretax segment operating margins declined 178 basis points largely due to seasonality and lower APS revenue. From a year-on-year perspective, margins expanded 298 basis points with significant margin growth in three of our four Divisions. Let me now go through the first quarter results for each Division. First quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $894 million decreased 12% sequentially with margins declining 8 percentage points to 30%. These decreases were primarily due to lower APS project revenue and seasonally lower digital and exploration data licensing sales. The APS revenue decline was mostly a result of a pipeline disruption in Ecuador that temporarily reduced production and lower commodity prices impacting our project in Canada. As a result of these issues, APS revenue declined year-on-year, but this effect was more than offset by strong digital growth, including a more than 50% increase in our cloud and edge solutions. Margins for the Digital & Integration division are expected to improve in Q2 as the pipeline issue in Ecuador has been resolved and as digital sales will increase sequentially in line with the usual seasonal trend. Reservoir Performance revenue of $1.5 billion decreased 3% sequentially while margins declined 207 basis points to 16.1%. These decreases were primarily due to seasonal activity reductions in Europe and Asia and lower revenue in Russia. Year-on-year, revenue grew 24% and margins increased 291 basis points driven by strong growth internationally, both on land and offshore. Well Construction revenue of $3.3 billion increased 1% sequentially, while margins of 20.6% decreased 44 basis points. However, year-on-year revenue grew 36% while margins expanded 444 basis points with very strong growth across all Areas on higher activity, increased pricing and a favorable technology mix. Finally, Production Systems revenue of $2.2 billion was essentially flat sequentially and margins declined 148 basis points to 9.3% due to seasonality and the activity mix in Europe and Asia. Year-on-year, revenue increased 38%, while margins expanded 217 basis points driven by strong activity across all areas led by Europe, Latin America, and North America. Margins also improved compared to the first quarter of last year as supply chain and logistics constraints continued to ease. Now turning to our liquidity. Our net debt increased approximately $1 billion sequentially to $10.3 billion. During the quarter, we generated $330 million of cash flow from operations and negative free cash flow of $265 million reflecting the seasonal increase in working capital we typically experience in the first quarter. This largely reflects the payout of our annual employee incentives and the build\u00adup of working capital that will support our anticipated growth throughout the year. Our second quarter free cash flow is expected to be materially higher and to continue to increase into the third and fourth quarters. Capital investments, inclusive of CapEx and investments in APS projects and exploration data were $595 million in the first quarter. For the full year, we are still expecting capital investments to be approximately $2.5 to $2.6 billion. During the quarter, we monetized our remaining investment in Liberty, which resulted in net proceeds of $137 million. We also spent $244 million, net of cash acquired, on acquisitions and investments in other businesses, the majority of which relates to the Gyrodata acquisition. Finally, we resumed our stock repurchase program and repurchased 4.4 million shares during the quarter for a total purchase price of $230 million. We will continue to repurchase shares in the coming quarters and, as previously announced, we are targeting to return a total of $2 billion dollars to our shareholders this year between dividends and stock buybacks. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier. Sure, Neil. So yes, it does reverse. As you know, Q1 is always the lowest quarter of the year for free cash flow. As mentioned, we have the typical working capital buildup. Particularly, we have the payout of annual employee incentives. This is a one-off. It was about $500 million in the first quarter. And then we build inventory for anticipated growth, particularly in the Production System division, as we've mentioned. So even though it was -- it remained negative, the free cash flow actually came slightly ahead of our own expectations. Our DSO was the lowest historically for a first quarter so we were quite happy with that. So yes, it will increase in the second quarter and it will accelerate in the second half on higher EBITDA, continuous capital discipline and working capital unwinding. Keeping in mind, we typically generate the majority of our annual cash flow in H2, but it will increase materially in Q2. So when you put it all together, the 2023 full year free cash flow will be significantly higher than last year. And clearly, on the trajectory to deliver the 10% free cash flow margin we committed for the 2021 to 2025 period. And just to close, this will allow us to, as Olivier mentioned and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, to return $2 billion to shareholders in the form of dividend and buybacks together. Thank you. So look, Roger, on EPS, we really have to distinguish Ecuador. These are service contracts, tariff-based. There's no intention to exit. And we do need to maintain a minimum level of investment. But rest assured, these projects are highly positive in terms of not only earnings but cash flow. The Canada asset is a bit different. This is a pure equity position. And it's also very accretive in terms of cash flow even at current commodity prices. And as you know, we ran a process on that particular asset last year.

            "name": "Olivier Le Peuch",
            "content": "Thank you, ND. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on the call today. In my prepared remarks, I will cover three topics. I will begin with an update on our first quarter results; then, I will share our latest view on the macro and our positioning for long-term success; and finally, I will close with our outlook for the second quarter and full year. Stephane will then provide more details on our financial results, and we will open for your questions. It has been a great start of the year as we achieved results that set us on a solid footing for our full\u00adyear financial ambitions. On a year-on-year basis, our financial and operational results were strong across all geographies and Divisions. Following the remarks that are shared in our earnings release this morning, I would like to emphasize a few key highlights from the quarter. First, we delivered very solid year-on-year growth at a magnitude last seen more than a decade ago. Geographically, year -on-year growth rates in North America and internationally were comparable. More importantly, the rate of change is tilting more in favor of the international markets, where sequentially we experienced the smallest seasonal decline in recent times. Collectively, our Core divisions grew year-on-year by more than 30% and expanded operating margins by more than 300 basis points. We continue to position the core for long term success with significant contract wins and technology innovations that improve efficiency and lower carbon emissions. A great example is EcoShield, a geopolymer based cement-free well-integrity system and one of our latest Transition Technologies launched earlier this quarter. You will find many examples of these contract wins and the performance impact of our new technologies in today's press release. In Digital, we maintained strong growth momentum and also secured more contract wins. At a Division level, the amount of year-on-year revenue growth in Digital was somewhat masked by significantly lower APS revenue due to production interruptions in Ecuador and lower project revenue in the Palliser asset in Canada. Additionally, Digital continues to help us elevate our efficiency and margin performance in the Core, as we deploy these solutions at scale in our global operations. And in New Energy, we continue to make progress across our portfolio, notably with new Carbon Capture and Sequestration activities that raise our involvement to around 30 projects globally. CCS is recognized as one of the fastest-growing opportunities to reduce carbon emissions, and with the tailwinds from the US Inflation Reduction Act and other initiatives around the world, we expect more projects to move forward to final investment decisions in the next few years. Finally, we are delivering on our commitment to increase returns to shareholders. During the quarter, we relaunched our share buyback program, with repurchases totaling more than $200 million worth of shares. I would like to really thank the entire SLB team for their hard work and for delivering yet another successful quarter. Moving to the macro, we maintain a constructive multiyear growth outlook. Through the first quarter, the resilience, breadth, and durability of the upcycle have only become more evident. I would like to take a few minutes to describe these factors. To begin, the underlying demand, investments, and activity during this cycle are resilient, despite short-term economic and demand uncertainties. The combination of energy security, the initiation of long-cycle projects, and OPEC's policy, sets the conditions for a de-coupling of the activity outlook from short-term uncertainties. Indeed, energy security remains a top priority for most countries, and is driving structural investments that are governed primarily by national interests. The extent of these investments is resulting into a broad-ranging growth outlook, comprised predominantly of resilient long-cycle projects in the Middle East, the international offshore basins, and in gas projects. Collectively, we expect these market segments to reach or exceed more than two-thirds of the total global upstream spend and support a long tail of resilient activity over the next few years. In parallel, the North America market, characterized by higher short-cycle exposure, is also set to benefit from positive demand outlook and supportive commodity pricing. However, this will be impacted by an anticipated activity plateau in the short term, which will subsequently be reflected in production volumes. Moving to the dimensions of breadth and duration, these are also best emphasized by the latest activity outlook for the Middle East and Offshore market segments. Fundamentally, the pivot to both segments as anchors of supply growth is a defining attribute of this cycle. This is providing an unprecedented level of investment visibility and a scale that is setting many records. In the Middle East, the largest ever investment cycle has now commenced. This will support ongoing capacity expansion projects over the next four years, in both oil and gas. Consequently, this year we expect to post our highest revenue ever in the Middle East putting us on track to achieve our multi-year growth aspirations. Simultaneously, we are witnessing further activity expansion in the offshore markets. Offshore activity continues to surprise to the upside, with breadth and a diversity of opportunities across all major basins. In addition, the latest FID projections and industry reports indicate that the offshore sector is set for its highest growth in a decade, with more than $200 billion in new projects through the next two years. This growth will be supported by three layers of activity: First, the resumption of infill and tieback activity in mature basins, which was very visible across Africa in 2022. This will continue to strengthen in multiple geographies from this year onwards. Second, ongoing large development projects in both and oil and gas that are ramping-up and starting to scale. This is evident in Latin America such as in Guyana and Brazil, and in the Middle East such as in Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Qatar. And third, the resurgence of exploration and appraisal activity, which is starting to gather strong momentum in existing basins and new frontiers. From West & South Africa to the East Mediterranean, we are starting to see exploration and appraisal at a pace that was unforeseen just a few months ago. Additionally, the activity pipeline continues to elongate with new licensing rounds and new blocks awarded. As a result, we believe that we will continue to witness durable offshore investment for many years to come. Let me spend a couple of minutes highlighting what this means for SLB. As the cycle unfolds, the characteristics I have described continue to align with major strengths in our Core. This will support additional activity intensity for Well Construction; accelerated growth opportunities in Reservoir Performance through the return of Exploration & Appraisal activity; and further long-term growth potential for Production Systems. One such example is the TPAO Sakarya project in the Southern Black Sea offshore Turkey. This project involved all our Core Divisions supporting the development of a challenging subsea gas asset and the simultaneous construction of a gas production facility, demonstrating SLB's unique ability to integrate at scale, from Pore-to-Process. Looking more in-depth, our Production Systems Division is in a unique position as a long-cycle lever of growth for us with quarterly year-on-year results demonstrating our ability to fully harness its potential. We believe momentum is set to continue, benefiting from our strong market presence in the Middle East, and in the Offshore basins. In this Division, we anticipate cumulative bookings in the range of $10 billion to $12 billion in 2023, up significantly from 2022. We have taken a strong step forward towards this ambition with more than $3 billion in bookings in the first quarter, and the outlook supports continued strong bookings through at least 2025. Overall, this will provide durable revenue growth and a significant installed base for services in the years to come. In this context, our exposure to the Deepwater subsea market remains an essential component of our growth opportunity, and we continue to strengthen this part of our portfolio with much success. In Subsea, we have grown 20% over the last two years and are already generating EBITDA margins in the high teens, building on our technology, performance in execution, and the depth of our processing portfolio. We expect strong momentum for this part of our business to be sustained through 2025 and beyond. To conclude, we are in the midst of a unique cycle with qualities that enhance the long-term outlook for our industry-Resilience, Breadth, and Durability-all reinforced by a pivot to the Middle-East, Offshore, Gas, and a return of E&A. We could not ask for a better backdrop to execute our returns-focused strategy. During the early phase of this cycle, led by North America, our results have already demonstrated our ability to capture growth ahead of activity and expand margins visibly beyond pre-pandemic levels. Looking forward, we are positioned to fully harness the International and Offshore momentum that is now underway, and to further our margins expansion journey. In the quarters ahead, we will continue to demonstrate our returns focus, capital discipline, and commitment to shareholder returns. I am truly excited about the outlook for SLB. Next, I would like to comment on our progress over the shorter term. For the full year, our strong first quarter gives us renewed confidence in our financial ambitions for 2023. We are primed for revenue growth and margin expansion through the year, underpinned by a very solid international outlook. In North America, we still expect tangible market growth but at a lower rate than originally anticipated at the start of the year, mainly as a result of ongoing weakness in gas prices. Taken together, we expect the strong international growth to offset any weakness in North America keeping our full year ambitions intact, with year-on-year growth in excess of 15%, which would support adjusted EBITDA growth in the mid-twenties. More specific to the second quarter. Directionally, we expect revenue to grow about mid-to-high single digits with operating margins expanding by 50 to 100 basis points driven by a seasonal rebound in the International markets. Growth will be led by the Middle East & Asia Area, and continued momentum in the offshore markets. Building on this, we expect our second quarter adjusted EBITDA to reach new highs in this cycle, further extending the earnings growth journey we initiated 11quarters ago and taking another positive step towards achieving our full year ambitions. I will now turn the call over to Stephane. Thank you, Stephane. Ladies and gentlemen, I think we will open now the floor to your questions. No, James, thank you. I think indeed, I think we have highlighted and I think in my prepared remarks, I shared the view that in the recent months and certainly in last quarter and I have been traveling in Asia, Middle East and South America. I have seen a customer, I think, taking commitments and being ready to commit to the supply capacity and to the partnership they need to deploy and develop the assets going forward as we believe this cycle is unique through, as we said, element of resilience by the nature of investment at growth rate, including the long-term capacity expansion committed in Middle East, including the large long-cycle elements that are growing in proportion led by offshore deepwater coming back. The breadth, I think everywhere we go, everybody needs - is seeing a customer reaching out to mobilize resource, sometimes for short-cycle production enhancements, most of the time for development commitment of assets and redevelopment expansion from infield to large-scale development. And durability is certainly improving and duration of the cycle, I think, is improving as we see because beyond the Middle East, '27 targets of capital expansion from -- for in the country. Other countries are targeting this towards the end of the decade. And here in the city in Brazil, Brazil has a clear ambition for 4 million barrel by 2030, and I've already committed up to 20 FPSO contract that will continue to build the pipeline of offshore activity subsea in particular going forward. So I'm very positive about the mix, if you like, of short cycle on production enhancements to address the anticipated supply super risk and the commitment -- long commitment from Middle East, from deepwater and offshore operator to complement the long cycle is not to offset and now take precedent over this short cycle and so turn, as we indicated, a turn into the cycle towards international offshore and Middle East in particular. So that's where we are very confident. Yes. I think the -- we are seeing pricing tailwinds and we have seen pricing tailwinds in the global market for quite a few quarters and starting in North America. It has turned to international based on two things: first, indeed, securing capacity going forward, giving us -- giving -- considering the tight supply of equipment, unique technology, giving a level of sense of urgency to secure contract and elongating the contract. You have seen example of nine years contract into the announcement we made today. And at the same time, I think performance matters. Performance matters to offshore operator. Performance matters for first gas, first oil. And there's a sense of urgency to accelerate the cycle. This is one of the priorities. And technology integration also makes a difference and is recognized and is driving a pricing premium. So the combination of supply capacity, the combination of, I would say, a sense of urgency for -- and quest for performance integration and technology deployment is driving pricing tailwinds that are serving us very well. Thank you. Good morning, Dave. Yes. No, I think you are correct. I think the supply of high-performance equipment in the Well Construction domain is under stretch today. And I think we are working very closely with our customers to prioritize equipment, price technology application and use integration, use digital to help deliver the performance they expect. So there is a stretch indeed in this. But going forward, I think we are committing the resource when we see the returns to be accretive to our margins and align with our expectation and ambition to continue to expand margins. So where we see the most activity, clearly, this year is an uptick and this will be the case as sequentially next quarter is in Middle East and offshore. A combination of an integrated contract we have in offshore with relatively complex assets on occasion that demands a lot of technology deployments. And the intensity of activity in Middle East, that is a mix of short-cycle and long-cycle development project, this combination is unique and I think will be putting more resource, more equipment, more technology and will drive revenue forward up. Yes, it was, indeed, absolutely. I think offshore is not only international, I think offshore is happening in North America. North America as northeast Canada, Alaska offshore and go from Mexico, the combination of which is set to grow and our pace this year, the -- I would say, the U.S. land and North America (NAM) activity. So we are also getting the benefit of our fit for basin success in North America that continues to hold and help us maintain, grow our share and come on a premium on pricing. All of the above. Indeed. But I think, indeed, Dave, I think first, in this quarter, obviously, the growth, and we have seen growth rate in Digital that is aligned with our expectations, aligned with our ambition to double revenue from 2021 to 2025. We have seen, as Stephane mentioned, during his prepared remarks that the new technology edge and cloud is growing at more than 50%, continuing on the trajectory that we have set in the last couple of years. And we don't see any sign of this slowing down. And indeed, expansion will come from multiple dimension. Obviously, getting more consumption from the existing customer we have. And we are today deploying one of the largest contractor in Petrobras, where we were and we are meeting with the team here, very satisfied deployment and growing number of users. That's an axis then growing number of applications, and that's where we want to deploy and go beyond geoscience, our petrotechnical suite, if you like, to digital operation, production and digital operation into the drilling domain, automating the full rig well construction process. And again, in Brazil, we are very pleased to meet with Equinor and look after the Peregrinoplatform, we're about to deploy for the first time in the world a full automated top side to bottom assembly, fully automated autonomous digital journey that we'll realize this year. So we have both the geoscience application deployment, the digital operation, and we have new customers coming in, and you have seen some new contracts that we announced this quarter. So we are growing to the pace we are expecting to be our trajectory to double. And in this quarter, this was unfortunately masked fully by the APS setback, but we expect this to resume and to be actually one of the leading growth sequential that you would see in the second quarter. Thank you. Good morning, Chase. No, we have not seen it. We have not seen any impact of businesses, and we don't believe there will be any we believe that these companies and the national companies are really set and fully focused on mobilizing resource to execute their very ambitious capacity expansion plan. I think you are aware all the commitments. And it's not only UAE and Saudi. This is across many countries in GCC. And I think this is to grow both oil capacity and also gas and commercial and gas across the region. So I think I have -- I've been recently in the Middle East and have not seen any sign of and challenging. And again, the multiplicity of contract awards that were tendered in the last 18 months and most of them multiyear, if not beyond five years, are really indicative of the commitment and the capacity expansion plan that have started. Inflection has happened and you will see this growing for the rest of the year. So we don't foresee any impact. No, absolutely. I think we have indeed a unique right of play into the sequestration that have translated into a significant number of studies and services and modeling and digital that we have provided to a lot of customers. And these customers have approached us to participate, some of them emitters, that are non-oil and gas as you have seen some of the examples we gave in the press release earlier today. And then we are using our technology and innovation capability to explore and to invest into capture technology or to partner as we are partnering with Linde into the application of CCS project across the domain of blue hydrogen and ammonia for decarbonizing the natural gas, ammonia and halogen production. So we are indeed either associating or investing into capture technology, hence broadening our scope beyond sequestration and using our right of play to expand and create a business that will stand on its own in the years to come. Thank you, Chase. Yes. Let me take it at the level of Production System first and let me give a quick zoom. So the booking we are talking about is at the Production System level, which is the division encompassing our production system equipment capability from Subsea, as you pointed out, from actually in well completion, in well actually, subsea surface system processing capabilities. So when you put all of this together, you get an end-to-end from port to process, from send phase to processing that is quite unique in integration and delivery capability, hence, the opportunity we have to participate at scale and be a provider with our partner, Subsea 7, into the product of TPAO that you heard about where the first gas to flare was realized yesterday and celebrated by the -- in country. And this is quite unique so that's differentiated. We have end-to-end integration capability. We can design and deploy and develop a gas facility, and we have done this in the past and we can link it to with our partners to our subsea development and participate to the completion architecture. So this end-to-end is quite unique and give us opportunity to participate at a large scale into development. Now very specific to Subsea, I think we are also quite differentiated into the way that we can connect to the subsurface and we have this integration capability from the sub to the completion architecture. And one thing in particular I would like to highlight or two things. First is the electrical capability of transforming this Subsea 3, the subsea control and the subsea and well completion control into electric -- full electric capability. This is a game changer for the deepwater industry, game changer for low carbon and control -- digital control of subsea equipment and control of zone equipment and completion. This is very much again the case in Brazil. We are very fortunate to have established here a unique center of excellence, and we have, under the sponsorship of A&P working with multiple operators that have joined us into a joint development program where we are deploying and we will soon deploy everything from subsidiary to septic valve to flow control valve, fully electric, that would change the game and creating a new step. So that's differentiated. With differential obviously are processing, boosting and processing capability. You remember the award that we got last year into Shell for gas processing subsea equipment into a large installation in -- and you have seen two awards this quarter in Brazil, highlighting our boosting capabilities. So we're unique into that position. And again, ability we have to integrate processing equipment subsea with the rest of equipment well or surface is unique. And that's something that is adding to our digital capability as well. So when it comes to the announced JV, I think we are seeing the process of going to the regulatory bodies in different parts of the world so I cannot comment any further than what we commented earlier. This is an exciting outlook, exciting opportunity. But until close, we'll move forward. If anything, this visit has been outstanding, outstanding for the Board, outstanding for engagement we have customers and clearly highlighting the potential of Brazil to be fulfilling a significant supply growth. In the future, as I said, A&P and Brazil has ambition to reach or exceed 4 billion barrel from 3.3 billion today, I mean, on barrel per day. And they have already laid out the foundation of this of both production enhancement into the basin, the basin or the land basins and accelerating -- continue to accelerate the development of the sub-salt deepwater with up to 20 FPSO already into the play. So I think they also are pushing forward to the next frontier. They are about to explore Ecuador margin that give us another leg, if you like, of Brazil growth in the future beyond the already committed multi-year FPSO contract that are in place. So we don't see any change. If anything, we see an acceleration and extension of the duration of this Brazil outlook. And if I had to highlight one noticeable change that I've seen, a commitment to decarbonize, a commitment to digitalize that I think is the new -- the leadership is recommitted to. We have seen it and you will see it in the future. Digital operation will accelerate in Brazil by the main operator here. And the country will accelerate this commitment to CCS. We are very fortunate to be on the first and only bioenergy CCS project in Latin America with FS Bioenergia. And we met the team two days ago, and they are very pleased the progress we are making on the CCS product in Brazil. So you will see more activity and no slowdown, but any upside -- only upside to the offshore environment and then a low carbon and digital transition accelerating as well. Thank you. Yes. So as a reminder for everyone, I think our Digital & Integration division, I think, comprise and combines digital and exploration data with our Asset Performance Solutions. So at the onset of our digital journey, we have set clear ambition for Digital margin to be highly accretive to SLB, at the same time, to accelerate growth to double our revenue from '21 to '25. We are on that journey and clearly delivering a very accretive margin to SLB. So now we have demonstrated in the last few quarters last year that we -- when we leverage best performance in APS and our differentiated digital offering, we deliver DLM margin visibly in excess of 30%. Now notwithstanding similar setback as we had material setback in APS ambition for D&I as a combination is to continue to deliver highly accretive margins, certainly in the 30s. So going forward, we expect the margins of D&I to sequentially improve based on the very solid revenue growth from Digital and very accretive margin for digital, combined with a return of growth for APS and returning a decent margin for APS. So as a whole, we're expecting to not only revenue increase but margin expand in sequentially and to continue to be accretive -- highly accretive for the rest of the year. Thank you. Good morning, Scott. No, I will not be overly concerned by this. I think there are two factors that are playing into this. The first at Digital, I think, is having a significant productivity gain for processing, analyzing and generating prospects, as we call it, from -- from modeling, from structural modeling to prospect identification, the seismic data set as well as the capability to process using digital capability has significantly improved. So the ability to create spotlight on the gas line or the oil pools, I think, is better than it's ever been and certainly much better than last cycle. And secondly, I think there is a significant service consulting capability that we participate into that can help complement and provide support to our customers. But I would say, digital, productivity, technology that has improved and give higher accuracy, better geology interpretation capability, better structural modeling from seismic to wireline, and to modeling or to sampling like our ORA [reservoir] samplingtechnology, all combine to give a significant support to the G&G team of our customers and to not a slowdown but actually accelerate and improve the productivity and ability to generate prospects. So I'm not concerned. And I believe that you will see this prospect be fast-tracked from exploration to appraisal to development going forward. So I think I will contrast it more by saying the type of activity in exploration that is happening. And I think there are a lot of near-field exploration as it is called or backyard exploration that is being used by the most operators that have gained access to critical asset, critical basin or advantaged assets and they want to explore and do near-field exploration across and beyond and use tieback. So there is a lot of exploration happening across every basin, major basin that characterize this and has been -- this trend has been going up. And this trend is certainly different from the greenfield, frontier exploration that characterized maybe the last cycle. However, this cycle, I think, beyond the near-field exploration, we are seeing a return of frontier exploration, driven by energy security, driven by the desire to replace reserves and to secure new gas particularly, and we see it happening across many basins. I mentioned before the equatorial margin as one. You heard about, obviously, continuous exploration, which is almost becoming a near-field exploration across Guyana. But if you go across the Atlantic, you will find a lot of exploration happening in the south part of Africa, gave some huge success for two or three operator into Namibia that are here on the onset of something that could be very significant for the industry in oil development. And then gas in East Med, I think, has been developing, and you heard about the development that we helped fast-track on the Black Sea. That was also gas. So security is incentivizing people to invest and operator to invest into certain regions with access to the demand market and near-field is continuing to grow very well. So in combination, it's different from the past and I will not try to compare the scale but I think the quality of this exploration and the diversity in terms of customers and interval basin is quite unique and is really accelerating this year. Thank you. I think the energy security, the supporting commodity price outlook and the desire indeed to go and leverage the cycle to explore and to tie back reserve to the existing advantage basin or to fast-track gas or new oil pools as I described earlier. Now the timing of it, the acceleration, I think, is linked more to the availability of -- and the contracting of deepwater rigs or the contracting of rigs offshore or land on some occasion when it is -- when this exploration is happening. More than yes, but the cycle has started last year of E&A return is accelerating in line to some extent, with the offshore acceleration. And I think it will be part of the mix and will give an opportunity to extend and create a new leg of activity and a new leg of FID in two or three years from now when those exploration will have been appraised and will be FID at that time. So I think it's more -- it's an underlying trend that have started in the last few quarters and have accelerated. And I think that is a more long view that customers are taking and not looking at the short-term uncertainty or short-term commodity price variation and committing on one new basin or committing on expanding near-field exploration. So that's the way we have seen it. So ladies and gentlemen, I think I want to give a close to this call. It's almost to the hour. So to conclude today's call, I would like to leave you with the following takeaways. First, the quality of the unfolding upcycle in oil and gas is improving, with unique attributes of resilience, breadth and duration. This is very much evidenced by the strengthening outlook in both Middle East and offshore markets and further reinforced by the tight supply balance as demand forecast approach new highs at year-end. Second, our strong start of the year gives us further confidence in our full year financial ambition. Directionally, the dynamics in international markets will likely offset the moderation of activity growth in North America. In fact, we are witnessing a gradual shift from short-to long-cycle investment and a further transition to international, with both effects closely aligned with our strengths and paving the way for an exciting outlook for years to come. Third, our overall performance demonstrates the strength of our portfolio, focused on the most attractive and resilient market segments globally, both in oil and gas and low-carbon solutions. Our divisions continue to align with customers at most priorities on value delivered to performance and integration, with digital transformation and decarbonization as industry mandates. Additionally, pricing continues to trend positively, enabling us to extract more value for our products and services. As a result, we reaffirm our ambition to further expand margins as the cycle unfolds, to grow earnings to new levels in this cycle and to significantly increase returns to shareholders as further demonstrated this quarter. I remain very confident in the alignment of our strategy to formal trends in the energy market and fully trust the SLB team to continue outperforming in this context. Now before I close, I wanted to announce that ND Maduemezia will be moving to a new career opportunity in SLB after remarkable stands in his position as Investor Relations VP for the past three years. Thank you, ND, for the support and positive engagement with our investors and market analysts. Replacing ND is James McDonald, who is transitioning from his previous role as Americas Land Basin President. Welcome, James. With this, I want to close today's call and wish you all the best. Thank you. Good day, everyone."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to James R. McDonald, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations and Industry Affairs. Please go ahead.\nJames McDonald: Thank you, Leah. Good morning, and welcome to the SLB third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Today's call is being hosted from New York, following our Board meeting held earlier this week. Joining us on the call are Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Executive Officer; and Stephane Biguet, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind all participants that some of the statements we'll be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. For more information, please refer to our latest 10-K filing and other SEC filings, which can be found on our website. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our third- quarter press release, which is on our website. And finally, in conjunction with our proposed acquisition, SLB and ChampionX have filed materials with the SEC, including a registration statement with a proxy statement and prospectuses. These materials can be found on the SEC\u2019s website or from the parties\u2019 websites. With that, I will turn the call over to Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, James. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us this morning. During the call, I will cover a few topics. I\u2019ll start by reviewing our third-quarter results. Then, I will discuss how we are leveraging our differentiated market positioning, digital leadership, and operating efficiency to navigate the evolving macro environment. And finally, I will provide an update on our full-year financial ambitions and our early outlook for 2025. Stephane will then provide additional details on our financial results, and we will open the line to your questions. Let\u2019s begin. SLB delivered strong third quarter results with continued margin expansion. Sequentially, although revenue was flat, we expanded our adjusted EBITDA margin by more than 50 basis points to 25.6% by driving efficiencies throughout the business and we generated very strong free cash flow of $1.81 billion. In the international markets, revenue remained steady sequentially despite lower reactivity as commodity prices resulted in a more cautious approach to discretionary short cycle spending. Demand for SLB's digital products and services continued to accelerate and we saw continued growth in the Middle east and Asia, fueled by oil capacity expansions and strong gas activity as well as offshore projects. Meanwhile, revenue in Europe and Africa was largely unchanged as strong production and recovery activity in North Africa was offset by a decline in Latin America following a strong second quarter. Turning to North America, revenue increased 3% sequentially as higher offshore activity in the Gulf of Mexico was partially offset by lower drilling activity in U.S. land as the market remained constrained by gas prices and ongoing capital discipline by operators. Next, let me touch on the performance of the Divisions. In Digital & Integration, we delivered strong sequential growth led by our digital business, which reached a new quarterly revenue high. We also continued to increase profitability, expanding our pretax segment operating margin to 36%, driven by higher digital revenue and cost optimization. Overall, our digital business remains on pace to achieve full-year revenue growth in the high teens, and we announced a number of exciting new products and partnerships during the quarter that I will discuss a little later in today\u2019s call. Turning to the Core divisions, Production Systems continues to grow, benefitting from long-cycle development activity, particularly in the Middle East & Asia and in the Gulf of Mexico. I was proud to see that most Production Systems business lines contributed to this performance, as we continued to secure sizable bookings, while also increasing our backlog for the future. Reservoir Performance remained steady, supported by stable production and recovery spending, and Well Construction declined slightly, due to weaker land activity in North America and in the international markets. Overall, these results demonstrate SLB\u2019s unique ability to navigate the evolving market by leveraging our differentiated international and offshore positioning, our broad technology portfolio, and our continued focus on capital discipline and operating efficiency. I want to thank the SLB team for continuing to deliver for our customers and shareholders in this dynamic environment. I am extremely proud of their contribution and dedication to our performance strategy. Next, I wanted to share some updates on our progress in digital. We delivered another quarter of strong digital growth as operators continued to increase their investments in digital technology to reduce cycle times and risk, enhance productivity, lower costs and carbon, and accelerate returns. This is presenting opportunities for high margin growth, and we have taken a leading role in this space, partnering with our customers to accelerate their transition to the cloud, scaling new technology for drilling and production operations, and creating new markets by delivering disruptive solutions for data and AI. As part of this journey, we hosted our Digital Forum in September, where we brought more than 1,000 customers and partners to innovate solutions and shape our shared digital future. During this event, we launched the Lumi data and AI platform, which will accelerate advanced data and generative AI capabilities at scale for SLB\u2019s customers across the energy value chain. Today, we offer approximately 150 AI and machine learning capabilities across our products and solutions, and we continue to work with our customers and partners to innovate and deploy new ones. We also unveiled a number of cross-industry announcements during the Forum. Theis includes a collaboration with NVIDIA to develop generative AI solutions for energy, as well as a partnership with Amazon Web Services to expand access to applications from the Delfi digital platform and to evaluate decarbonization solutions for Amazon\u2019s digital infrastructure. Each of these agreements helps to expand our capability set and positions SLB as a key partner in digital and sustainability across the industry. Next, let me discuss the macro environment. Over the past few months, commodity prices have been under pressure. This is largely due to concerns of an oversupplied market, driven by higher output from non-OPEC+ producers, uncertainty around OPEC+ supply releases, weaker demand from China, and softer economic growth rates in the U.S. and Europe. This has resulted in a cautionary approach to activity and discretionary spend by many customers as highlighted in our third-quarter results. Despite these evolving market conditions, we believe the long-term fundamentals for oil and gas remain in place. Demand for energy is increasing and energy security remains a global priority, as witnessed by recent commodity price fluctuations tied to geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. In this environment, gas will continue to play an increasing role in the energy transition, while oil will remain a large part of the energy mix for decades to come. Internationally, gas investment remains strong, particularly in Asia, the Middle East, and the North Sea, and is expected to grow regardless of OPEC+ decisions on oil production. Meanwhile, while short-cycle oil investments have been more challenged, long-cycle deepwater projects globally and most capacity expansion projects in the Middle East remain economically and strategically favorable. Specific to North America, we do not see U.S. activity rebounding in the near term, and any potential increases in gas rigs could be quickly offset by a further decline in oil rigs due to increased operating efficiency. Overall, we expect this to result in a sustained level of global upstream investment in the years to come, with the secular trends of digital and industry decarbonization extending the investment horizon. SLB is well positioned to navigate in this evolving macroenvironment through our differentiated portfolio and multipronged strategic approach across Core, Digital, and New Energy. With that backdrop, let me conclude my opening remarks by sharing our outlook for the full year 2024 and our early thoughts regarding 2025. Specific to the fourth quarter, we expect muted revenue growth, with a favorable mix of year-end digital and product sales partially offset by E&P budget exhaustion in U.S. land and cautious discretionary spending from certain international customers. And, with continued cost optimization, we anticipate we will deliver EBITDA margin expansion in the fourth quarter. For the full year of 2024, ongoing margin expansion will enable us to deliver full-year adjusted EBITDA margins at or above 25%. Additionally, our strong cash flows, coupled with the announced sale of our Palliser asset in Canada, will support increased returns to our shareholders. In 2025, we see the potential for upstream spending in the international markets to grow in the low to mid-single digits, while North America spending will be flat to slightly down. This directional outlook will depend on the geopolitical environment and commodity prices, and we will share an updated view in January after we receive more feedback on customer budgets. In conclusion, SLB remains well positioned to deliver strong financial results, as our optimized cost structure, portfolio rationalization, differentiated exposure to key international and offshore markets, and digital leadership will support further margin expansion, higher cash generation, and increased returns to shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Stephane.\nStephane Biguet: Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Third-quarter earnings per share excluding charges and credits was $0.89. This represents an increase of $0.04 sequentially and $0.11, or 14%, when compared to the third quarter of last year. During the quarter we recorded $0.02 of merger and integration charges relating to the Aker subsea and ChampionX transactions and $0.04 of charges in connection with the program we started last quarter to realign and optimize the support and service delivery structure in certain parts of our organization. Overall, our third-quarter revenue of $9.2 billion was essentially flat sequentially. However, the third quarter represented another quarter of both sequential and year-on-year margin expansion despite revenue growth rates moderating. These improvements were driven by very strong Digital & Integration margins combined with the effect of the cost optimization program I just mentioned. Additionally, the resilient, long-cycle Production Systems business continued its top line growth and margin improvement journey, benefiting from its strong backlog. Sequentially, our pretax segment operating margin expanded 48 basis points to 20.8%. Company-wide adjusted EBITDA margin increased 55 basis points to 25.6%, representing the highest level since the first quarter of 2016. Let me now go through the third-quarter results for each Division. Third-quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $1.1 billion increased 4% sequentially with margins expanding 456 basis points to 35.5%. The sequential revenue growth was entirely due to higher digital sales, as APS revenue was flat. The strong margin performance was driven by improved digital profitability as a result of the higher uptake of new digital solutions and the optimization of our digital support and delivery structure. Reservoir Performance revenue of $1.8 billion was flat sequentially as higher intervention activity in international markets was offset by lower evaluation revenue in Latin America and the Middle East. Margins contracted 53 basis points due to the unfavorable technology mix. Well Construction revenue of $3.3 billion decreased 3% sequentially on lower rig count in U.S. land and Saudi, and the completion of drilling projects in certain offshore markets. Margins decreased 19 basis points as a result of the lower activity. Finally, Production Systems revenue of $3.1 billion increased 3% sequentially driven by higher sales of surface production systems, completions, and artificial lift, led by North America and the Middle East & Asia. Margins expanded 110 basis points to 16.7% on improved profitability in artificial lift, completions, surface and midstream production systems. With regard to our liquidity, our cash flow performance during the third quarter was very strong, as we generated $2.4 billion of cash flow from operations and free cash flow of $1.8 billion. This represents a $1 billion increase in free cash flow as compared to last quarter, largely due to significant customer collections. Capital investments, inclusive of CapEx and investments in APS projects and exploration data, were $644 million in the third quarter. For the full year, we are still expecting capital investments to be approximately $2.6 billion. On the M&A front, as announced yesterday, I am pleased to report that we have signed a definitive agreement to sell our interests in the Palliser APS project in Canada. This transaction will reduce our direct exposure to commodity prices and the associated earnings volatility as well as reduce our capital intensity. It also allows us to eliminate significant future abandonment liabilities. Under the terms of the agreement, we will receive cash proceeds of approximately $430 million U.S. dollars, subject to closing adjustments that are typical for such a transaction. This transaction will also result in us removing asset retirement obligations from our balance sheet with a present value of approximately $280 million. This transaction, which is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, is expected to close before the end of this year. Turning to the pending ChampionX acquisition, the integration teams on both sides have been working together closely, and we are extremely pleased with the progress they are making. We now anticipate the transaction to more likely close in the first quarter of 2025. Finally, total returns to shareholders, in the form of stock repurchases and dividends, was approximately $2.4 billion on a year-to-date basis. During the third quarter, we repurchased 11.3 million shares for a total purchase price of $501 million. As a result of our strong cash flow performance, we expect to maintain this level of buyback in the fourth quarter. Consequently, we will exceed our previous commitment to return $3 billion to our shareholders in 2024. Furthermore, we reaffirm that we will return a minimum of $4 billion to shareholders in 2025, reflecting our confidence in our ability to continue generating strong cash flows. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Stephane. Ladies and gentlemen, we will open the floor to your questions.\nOperator: Operator Instructions] And our first question is from James West with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nJames West: So, Olivier, obviously, more muted top line growth as we go through '25 is kind of expected here, but you guys have a lot of initiatives underway that will drive, I think, margin -- continued margin journey, margin expansion journey, I guess, is a better way to put it. Could you talk about some of the drivers there and how you see -- maybe you or Stephane, how you see that unfolding as we go through the year? I know you don't want to give too many specifics yet on the year given the budgets being quantified, but just maybe help us a little bit on how this could unfold.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yes. Good question. Thank you, James. So yes, indeed, we have the ambition to maintain our margin expansion journey as we enter 2025 or exit rate of 2024, with the results we have delivered in Q3, the ambition we have and the statement we have made on further expansion in the fourth quarter will bode very well as we enter 2025 to start the year with a kick if I may. And now looking forward, I think the guidance at this point, market spend will indicate that they will benefit from another year of international growth outpacing North America, which again and plays in our favor from the margin mix. And obviously, the combination of our digital tech -- technology premium will continue to play favorably as we accelerate technology introduction and continue the journey and ambition, we have on the on digital to reach approximately $3 billion on the and some of a year of strong growth. And finally, I think we have initiated some cost out and operating efficiency focus for our team, entire team and this is already falling through into our results, and I expect this to take full scale in 2025.\nJames West: Got it. Okay. Great. And then, now that we're a little over a month out from your digital forum that you held recently, could you maybe share some of your initial thoughts on the success of the form. It seemed to me at least that the uptake in digital. Clearly, you just mentioned $3 billion in revenue. But for next year, but digital uptake is accelerating and the quality of the digital uptake, not just going to cloud, but also using all the AI tools is accelerating as well. But I wanted to get your, now that we've gotten on the way your thoughts on that.\nOlivier Le Peuch: No, fair. I think first, I'm very pleased to report that this was most likely on many aspects, our best forum ever. And from the size, the scale of the attendance, number of partners that came to join us, the number of customers that came and display their own technology. I think we're having the opportunity -- we had the opportunity to show the digital value proposition we offer in industry across the different domains from [geoscience] subsurface to operations, show it that we have an integrated platform, open platform approach with partners, and they are extending our technology from the historical on-prem to cloud edge and now AI, including Gen AI. So, I think this resulted into not realization by many customers that we can impact all aspects of the operation, unlock value in productivity, in the geoscience space, in operation for performance, and in reducing cost and carbon going forward. So, the pickup, if any, that I have is that this market in terms of TAM will expand going forward with accelerated expansion as customers realize that there is maturity into offering. There is maturing to the partnership ecosystem that we have developed. And there is opportunity for them to capture this as they want to extract efficiency as they want to be more competitive. And I believe that our opportunity is to accelerate the adoption of the toolbox that we have invested in the last 10 years to particularly benefit from digital operation. There is one domain that I think has really blossomed in the last 18 months is digital operation in production, in drilling, autonomous operation, optimization, edge AI applications that are really game changing the way we can perform with our customers, and that's where I see the future. So longer term, going beyond the cycle, growing for the long term as a business for us.\nOperator: Next question we have is from David Anderson with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nDavid Anderson: So, the customers -- your customers are being more cautious though your projects are still moving ahead. It seems pretty clear the cycle is kind of plateauing here. International spending, you're saying that was low, mid-single digits next year. But if you look at the prior cycle, the second half of that was really driven by sustained deepwater development. So, my question is, do you think deepwater can once again be a driver of growth, say, beyond '25? We have something like 300 billion in FID in the last few years. You just announced a slew of Petrobras awards today, and I have Namibia and Suriname on the horizon. So, my question is, is that enough to drive growth overall spending higher? Or is it just really a function of the oil prices needs to structurally improve in order to kind of get this cycle kind of reaccelerating?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yes, I think you have seen the realization that when commodity price is under pressure, there is some pressure on short cycle that is suppressed and that may come back and will come back as soon because it impacts increased drilling, impacts intervention activity, it impacts short cycle and commercial in some region, but it will most likely come back as soon as the community price regain traction. But the long cycle, apart from some decision on timing and project execution have been untouched. And we have had a year of strong exploration activity that has unlocked new reserve, that has appraised new future pipeline of deepwater, as you have heard and seen across Americas, across South Africa, across the East Mediterranean and across Asia, where gas is critical. And the combination of these, as you know, is representing every year. This year, I think the total offshore FID will approach $100 billion, and we expect that this rate of $100 billion the FID for offshore will remain at that level or higher for the next two or three years. So, the cumulative over '23 to '26 of offshore will exceed $500 million of offshore FID and that's a sign that this project will execute beyond '25, beyond '26 and will be a growth engine for the industry going forward.\nDavid Anderson: That's great to hear. Also, it's great to hear is the sale of the Palliser Block. Glad to put that behind us and now we can kind of focus much more on the digital business, of course, and I guess one of the things that you had talked about at that forum is that digital has been accretive -- is accretive to growth in margins going forward. And clearly, it's been that way already. So. you're well on your way to hitting your $3 billion target of revenue next year. And naturally, I have to ask you what's next. I don't think you're ready to give out the new target yet, otherwise, you probably would have already done that. But I guess I'm just wondering about is where do you see that growth coming from? You just talked about extended on that production side. So maybe that's another leg of growth. But a big part of this has been coming to from the well construction. And I'm wondering, if deepwater can be also a huge driver of the digital business going forward.\nOlivier Le Peuch: It is already. I think we are already deploying our well construction automation and optimization, autonomous operations in some offshore rigs and making huge defense where the cost of rig operation matters, and this is something that will unlock the future. But I think I will split in the three categories. I think you have a platform transition, cloud transition that has happened that affects the more than 1,000, 1,500 customers we have, and it's a long transition that will continue to happen one customer at a time, cloud transition that will continue to drive our Delfi adoption across our customer space in [geoscience], and we'll continue to see this affecting and being a long cycle, a long period of growth for years to come as a driver. The second is, as you mentioned, as I mentioned, the digital operation, be it in production and drilling with the emergence of edge application, the emergence of autonomous optimization application, and this is both seen by the digital services that our core divisions offering, well construction, production system and reservoir performance with having much success with this digital offering that they are putting on the back of our Delfi, and we see it into the pickup of our production and drilling operation capability by the customers themselves. And finally, and the third leg of growth in our digital portfolio, is the emergence of new data and AI capability, as you have seen, the Lumi that we have put in place. So, we combine these three over the future horizon. This will continue to be digital. As a consequence, we continue to be a growing TAM for us and will be an engine of growth that will be accretive to the top line and will deliver accretive margin to the Company. So that's the way we see it. And I will not, at this point, set the target for the risk next, but we'll continue to see growth between '25 with this context.\nOperator: Our next question is from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nScott Gruber: I'm glad to hear that you still see some growth next year. I want to ask a question that where we try to separate operating leverage that results in growth from other margin drivers. So, if we assume that upstream spending is flattish for the next three years, is there a certain level of margin expansion that you think you could achieve through further cost optimization and further growth in digital, I assume that you would challenge the organization to continue expanding margins and a flat backdrop. Just curious what that potential rate of margin improvement could be?\nStephane Biguet: Yes. First, we do see not only in Q4 and into 2025, further margin expansion on that upstream spending outlook. And as you actually mentioned, it comes from several components. It comes primarily, I would say, from the mix of activities in our various divisions. As Olivier indicated, digital is a booster to our overall company margins, technology mix, performance contract or performance in general pushes margins as well. And yes, there's an element of cost optimization, not only from the program, we started at the end of last quarter -- sorry, at the beginning of last quarter of Q3, but also from our continuous focus on cost, we will continue to adjust delivery resources based on level activities, and we will continue to look for further optimization in our structure. So, it's a mix of all these components that will continue to push our margins into 2025.\nScott Gruber: Got it. And Stephane, how would the financials be impacted by the Palliser sale? How much EBITDA comes on? How much CapEx comes out?\nStephane Biguet: Yes. So, we -- on Palliser, we generate approximately $500 million of revenue per year on the asset. And this comes with pretax margins in the in the high 30s. Now you mentioned something very important. It also removes quite a bit of investment that we need to inject every year to maintain this number. So, it's the CapEx is about $150 million per year. And as I mentioned as well in my prepared remarks, something not to underestimate is removing future abandonment liabilities, which discounted are about $280 million, but undiscounted are close to $1 billion. So that's -- it's a good thing. This is going away from our balance sheet and P&L, and it will reduce both earnings volatility and capital intensity.\nOperator: Next, we go to Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nArun Jayaram: Olivier, you framed that you're seeing a little bit of cautiousness in some of the short-cycle markets, North America, international oil with some resiliency in long cycle gas and deepwater opportunities. I was wondering how -- if you could -- how would you characterize the price -- the current pricing dynamics internationally, just relative to your expectations of margin expansion from here?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think we believe that the pricing environment is still positive, constructive, I would say. I think first, realizing that the industry is capital discipline. And the industry has no spare capacity to move and to place. And as a consequence, performance, technology and integration capabilities still give us opportunity to support our pricing, and I don't see it in the current environment changing very much.\nArun Jayaram: Fair enough. I had a follow-up on New Energy. You guys press release an update on your lithium DLE pilot in the quarter in Nevada, which highlighted a very high kind of recovery rate I was wondering if you could talk about alleviated the next steps to commercialize this technology. How competitive are the extraction costs today versus existing technologies? I wondering if you could just maybe frame the growth opportunity from lithium?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Well, as you pointed out, I think first, we are very pleased to have achieved these milestones again, the milestone has been to produce lithium carbonate from our demonstration plant in Nevada using direct lithium extraction from brine and using a concentration and purification process that we have integrated with our own IP and using some external technology and putting this together and working for months to tune it to digitally optimize it and to realize this. So, our plan forward is to work with prospective partners and customers. to see how this technology can be used and to respond to big demand that exists and some plans that some of our customers and partners have announced to use DLE as a method to extract lithium and produce in large quantity in the coming years. So, we are looking forward to technology to scale it for application as a license technology or as a partner where we will develop and run going forward this technology with our customers and partners. That's the way we look into it. And again, very good first and benchmark performance for such a DLE plant and exciting prospect -- long-term prospect for us in this new space.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNeil Mehta: Yes. A couple of financial questions. Maybe as we think about 2025 over the summer, you had talked about that $10 billion EBITDA target for '25 on a 20% CAGR. Just in light of some of the macro commentary, can you just talk about some of those moving pieces as it relates to that guide? And I think you've given us a lot of moving pieces, but I'd like to just kind of tie that out.\nStephane Biguet: So makes sense, Neil. So really, yes, again, margin expansion is -- we are laser focused on this. We've been increasing EBITDA margins for year-on-year for 15 consecutive quarters, and we don't intend to stop. So, this is our mission. And as I explained, it's made of several types of components. Now to your specific question on 2025 and the absolute value of EBITDA compared to our long-term '21 to '25 CAGR ambition, it is possible that indeed, with the current macro outlook again to be refined, and if we exclude for the moment just to compare apples to apples, with apple, sorry, if we exclude ChampionX, it's possible that the '21 to '25 CAGR will finish in the high teens rather than breaking that 20% bar.\nNeil Mehta: That's really helpful. And then it was a super quarter for free cash flow. You guys beat our model by quite a bit, very strong collections. Can you just talk about how you're thinking about -- first of all, I'll talk about the go forward for working capital and just the free cash flow profile into next year as well, including CapEx, which has been, again, trending in a constructive way.\nStephane Biguet: Yes, totally. So yes, we maintain capital discipline for sure. So, this is -- this is quite predictable, and it's a bit too soon to talk about CapEx for next year, but rest assured it's going to -- the theme of capital discipline, clearly, will be there considering the macro environment. So now specifically to our Q3 free cash flow, yes, always in the second half, we generate most of the year of free cash flow. And in Q3, this was in a way more than exacerbate here. So yes, Q3 was very strong. And as we highlighted and as you mentioned, it's really -- it was really driven by customer collections. In a way Q2 was a little bit low on collections, so there's a bit of a catch-up effect. And Q4 will essentially be dependent on will be strong. It will also be dependent on customer collection. But as you can see, we do experience volatility in those collections from a quarter to another. So, we'll continue to push. We'll definitely finish the year high note as it relates to working capital and free cash flow work will continue to release as we finish the year. And going into next year, again, a bit too soon to give you a number for free cash flow, but definitely, it will be higher than 2024, not only from us, but of course, with the addition of ChampionX. And this is why we are quite comfortable to reaffirm or $4 billion target returns to shareholders for next year because free cash flow will increase in '25.\nOperator: Next, we go to Kurt Hallead with Benchmark. Please go ahead. Mr. Hallead, do you have your phone muted?\nKurt Hallead: Olivier, you did highlight a more tempered outlook as you go to into 2025. So, we appreciate that. In the context of those dynamics, usually as the industry kind of goes into a more moderate growth or some markets kind of go into a little bit of a slowdown. There's some pricing pressures that maybe come along with that. Just wondering, if you're starting to see or starting to have some of those conversations with your customer base? And what -- if not, what may be different that's kind of driving the discussions with the customers to go around.\nStephane Biguet: Yes. I think in all cycle at any point in the cycle, I think we will always get under competitive pressure and under pressure from our customers to lower the cost of operation or improve product value. We believe that, I think, first and foremost, as long as we continue to perform credit value and exceed expectation on the performance of our operation, will relieve that any pressure that could come from a competitive and/or from a customer aspect. Secondly, we believe that the industry is tight on capacity, capacity of equipment, capacity of critical new technology. And the industry has demonstrated lately a strong capital discipline that has restrained this risk, I would say. But as long as I think -- as long as we maintain a very high customer satisfaction through our performance, continue to our technology, continue to deliver our integrated value proposition, I think we will relieve any pressure that could arise into a moderating growth environment and defend our pricing and further improve our pricing when it has it matters, and hence protect our margins going forward. So, it's a matter of execution. It's a matter of relationship, but it's also a matter of capital discipline across the industry. And I believe the condition in this cycle is a bit different than what we have suffered in the past, and I'm looking at this constructively.\nKurt Hallead: Okay. That's great. That's great. Maybe a follow-up, coming full circle to your digital forum, a great event, by the way. What -- in the concept kind of the post meetings and so on and so forth, what were one or two things that came out of those meetings or discussions with potential clients of yours for your generative AI product. What was surprising to you that you maybe didn't anticipate going in?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think the customers were, I think, first, many of them participated themselves and 150 papers were presented by our customers, more than 10 of them presented their own application of digital to other customers. So, I think it was from a lot of learnings for customers to watch each other and to learn from each other and how do they use digital technology to unlock value. So, if take away, I think, at a high, high level, I think customer realized that we are more than just one [geoscience] application on the cloud, and we have a digital value proposition that expands across different domains and across different technology stack on-prem, cloud, edge AI and across the different dimension sensing and production. So, the full value proposition we have on digital, I think did surprise many of the customers as we continue to expand and have now a very comprehensive offering. That's the first takeaway, I think. The second is, I think the emergence of AI as x-factor for the industry to unlock more value of digital. This industry is data rich, I would say. And hence, we have deployed, as you heard, 150 engineered AI full of domain, full of physics, and full of the latest data science technique to unlock more performance into our digital application. And the latest announcement of Lumi as a platform that complements Delfi, and as a platform for putting an access in all E&P data in one framework to integrate all the applications across seamlessly. And finally, to create a framework that allow customer to use AI application on their datasets across the different domains and unlock new insights or create new performance. That's sort of Lumi data and AI is getting a lot of inbound requests as we have just announced it, and it will certainly be a factor of growth in the future as the industry recognized that there is a lot to unlock from data to liberate data and to realize value through AI including Gen AI application that we develop as you have heard with partners like NVIDIA, Mistral and others.\nOperator: Next, we go to Saurabh Pant with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nSaurabh Pant: I know there have been a lot of questions on digital, but I had one conceptual one, if you don't mind, Olivier. As we think about the upstream cycle maturing and growth slowing, I know digital has its own secular drivers, SLB specific drivers. So, growth in digital should be different versus upstream spending. But conceptually, Olivier, how should we think about the variance, the sensitivity to digital growth opportunity relative to what the upstream market is doing? So, if growth in upstream spending slows from 10% to, let's say, low to mid-single digit, does it do too much to digital growth outlook? Or they are materially unrelated to each other?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think as we are very early in the curve of adoption of digital, I believe, they are largely uncorrelated at this point. And we see the TAM, total addressable market of digital in our industry, in upstream actually growing as the market may be moderating from upstream CapEx. We believe that the size of digital will actually, by contrast, grow. And our ability to not only participate fully, but also gain share in this market and unlock white space in this market, such as with Lumi data and AI, and offer edge autonomous operation, I think will create for us a long growth opportunity that will be largely decorated. Now, there are aspects of short term, I would say, discretionary decision on that can affect digital. But I think the long trend, I think, I believe is positive and long trend will continue to be a secular investment opportunity for customers that now they're realizing creates value today and hence is an opportunity to differentiate their performance for tomorrow.\nSaurabh Pant: Right, right. Okay. That makes a lot of sense, Olivier. And my follow up, Stephane, maybe for you. Obviously, you are accelerating cash return to shareholders. This year, you have your $4 billion -- at least $4 billion target for next year. But just conceptually, as we think about the percentage of your free cash flow that you might want to return to shareholders as the cycle matures. This year, it looks like you're going to be pretty close to 80%, which is a lot higher than your target. Conceptually, is it fair to assume Stephane that, that percentage of free cash flow continues to go up as the cycle matures?\nStephane Biguet: Well, you know, it is true. We set the minimum a few years back of 50%. So, yes, we have clearly exceeded that, and I'm quite happy we were actually able to exceed that. So, I mean, it really depends on investment opportunity. I think 80% is already a very good number. It's hard to tell you if it can get to 100% in 2025. I mean, it's really. We are happy with where our balance sheet is. Deleveraging has been a focus for a few years. We have turned that focus from deleveraging to return. So, depending on investment opportunities, returns to shareholders remains the priority at the moment. So, yes, you will see that percentage clearly above our initial short guidance of 50%. That's for sure.\nSaurabh Pant: Yes. No, that's perfect. I was not expecting you to raise it to 80% from 50%, but essentially that all makes a lot of sense as Stephane. Thank you. I'll turn it back.\nOperator: Next, we go to Roger Read with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nRoger Read: I'm going to come back to digital. It's the theme of the day. So let me ask the question slightly differently for you, Olivier, as you think about it. High growth, you've got to get customers on board. You've got to have the opportunities available internally, right in terms of people and offerings. So, as we think not just the growth rate in \u201825 to $3 billion. But beyond that, what do you see as potential bottlenecks be they internal or external, that you've really got to deal with here, the front and center items about having the right people in the right place and making the inroads to your client base.\nOlivier Le Peuch: No, Roger, thanks for the question. I think there's nothing new. I think we have been working on going and understanding what can we do to unlock both from the go-to-market and from our own internal capability the digital growth. And I think we have been more success in the last few quarters. And I think it comes down to, I think engaging for customers, better understanding what I think, offering they are looking for. And I think this -- the going for multi-cloud going from hybrid cloud environment, on-prem and cloud, I think, has been an evolution that we have taken two to three years back, and I think it's paying off and is unlocking the growth. The other realization is that some customers don't necessarily are focused on the application, but I focus on data and they are willing to sort out and unlock the data. Hence, the operation of Lumi as a platform to address the customers that are more interested into unlocking data and directly accessing AI through a data platform as opposed to having to adopt the full suite. And I think we have seen this. We have done investment into our innovation factory to help collaborate for customers to tailor some fit-for-basin application to their needs. So, we have already gone through this. Is it all of cycle resolved? No. I think, as I said, it's one customer at a time, adoption on the cloud. However, I think there's something that help us a lot and I think is accelerating is the fact that digital operation led by our core division, production system, well construction and reservoir performance are becoming new agents of digital transformation for our customers, as they are pushing and getting successful into the adoption of digital services that are being delivered real time at the edge, such as autonomous drilling operation or wellbore insights or surveillance and optimization of some of our production system equipment. And this is one well at the time. This is one transaction at the time. So, the rate of adoption here, I think, and a push we have made to coalesce, if I may, are offering in the office, in the planning to offering into operation and at least under one umbrella of platform, I think, is unlocking the pace of adoption. And hence, we see this happening today, and we believe this will continue. So that's what we are doing to unlock, if you like, and working with partners to provide more options to our customers so that they recognize the ecosystem they work with. So, these are the two or three dimensions that we have worked with in the last 18 months, two or three years, and that are starting to bear fruits and starting to transfer into growth, and we don't see it changing going forward.\nRoger Read: I appreciate that. Yes, it sounds like incremental and then eventually, we get to cascade with this. As a follow-up to that, Stephane, you mentioned capital intensity obviously declines with the sale here in the Canada E&P ops. What's the right way for us to think about capital intensity in terms of digital investments? Does it -- does capital and CapEx investment trail the revenue growth for a period of time, exceeded? Is there a way to think about maybe crossover eventually in that where the growth continues, but the capital intensity would decline? Or does it rely so much on capital investment elsewhere, there's not an easy way to think about that?\nStephane Biguet: So, it's clearly different from our core business. There's a little lag or a reasonable lag between investment CapEx in our core business and the related deployment of the tool in the field. In digital, it's a much longer cycle. So first, it's not CapEx. As you know, we expense all the investments because the investments are basically -- you can categorize them if you want, in product development, research and development, and this has been done over tempted to say the last years. So, there's always, of course, to come up with new solutions to enrich the platform. We need to continue investing every year. But we are not seeing spikes in there. We make our bit tragedies within given a lot. So, our growth in digital doesn't trigger incremental capital intensity because it's really smooth over many, many years. I would say that the heavy investments have been made in the past already now is just enriching the platform and supporting the enriched offering for the customer.\nOperator: And our last question will come from Stephen Gengaro with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nStephen Gengaro: Two for me. The first, just sort of thinking about the short term in the fourth quarter. Can you talk a little bit about the sort of the puts and takes as we look at the fourth quarter and maybe even versus sort of normal seasonality that we get every year? And I'm just also curious on the Gulf of Mexico, if there's been any big impact from the storm activity?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Not sure we got your second question. You are concerned about -- the second part of your question.\nStephen Gengaro: Whether there's been much impact from the Gulf of Mexico storms.\nOlivier Le Peuch: So, I will start with this to say that we have seen muted impact on the Gulf of Mexico storm in our operation, and the Gulf of Mexico has been a driver for growth in the third quarter sequentially. As it comes to the fourth quarter and your question, I think the puts and takes, I think, yes, there is an element of seasonality, both on the positive side, which is the digital and product from production system year-end sales that will normally and will create a boost to our revenue. And there is a seasonality effect on some part of the Nova atmosphere that are starting to see either part of the sequence or budget exhaustion part in U.S. land we see an offset and I think these two, as we commented, will be partially offset and we see as a consequence muted growth going forward sequentially. But that's the puts and takes that we are seeing going forward.\nStephen Gengaro: Great. And then the second question was really -- I'm not sure you're willing to comment on this, but as you've mentioned earlier, you've kind of been going through the integration team on the CHX front. Has there been anything that you can talk about that has sort of increased or changed your thought process or optimism on the synergies?\nStephane Biguet: Well, we are -- as we said, we have been working quite a bit on both sides with the integration teams, and what we are seeing is really giving us even more confidence than we had originally on the transaction and on the synergies. So, we are not going to change our synergy target at this time, but we clearly confirm it, and we are quite happy with what we are seeing in that integration planning process.\nOperator: And I'll turn the conference back to SLB for closing comments.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Leah. Ladies and gentlemen, as we conclude today's call, I would like to leave you with the following takeaways: First, SLB remains well positioned to navigate commodity price fluctuations, benefiting from our unique operating footprint. Moving forward, we will continue to harness our technology deployment and integration capabilities to capture high margin opportunities in the international, deepwater, and gas markets. Second, our digital business remains a key differentiator in the industry. This will continue to drive higher margin growth while opening the door to new markets. And third, with our solid financial performance and focus on operating efficiency, we look forward to delivering further margin expansion, higher cash generation, and increased returns to shareholders. Thank you for joining us this morning. With that, I will conclude our call.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Third-quarter earnings per share excluding charges and credits was $0.89. This represents an increase of $0.04 sequentially and $0.11, or 14%, when compared to the third quarter of last year. During the quarter we recorded $0.02 of merger and integration charges relating to the Aker subsea and ChampionX transactions and $0.04 of charges in connection with the program we started last quarter to realign and optimize the support and service delivery structure in certain parts of our organization. Overall, our third-quarter revenue of $9.2 billion was essentially flat sequentially. However, the third quarter represented another quarter of both sequential and year-on-year margin expansion despite revenue growth rates moderating. These improvements were driven by very strong Digital & Integration margins combined with the effect of the cost optimization program I just mentioned. Additionally, the resilient, long-cycle Production Systems business continued its top line growth and margin improvement journey, benefiting from its strong backlog. Sequentially, our pretax segment operating margin expanded 48 basis points to 20.8%. Company-wide adjusted EBITDA margin increased 55 basis points to 25.6%, representing the highest level since the first quarter of 2016. Let me now go through the third-quarter results for each Division. Third-quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $1.1 billion increased 4% sequentially with margins expanding 456 basis points to 35.5%. The sequential revenue growth was entirely due to higher digital sales, as APS revenue was flat. The strong margin performance was driven by improved digital profitability as a result of the higher uptake of new digital solutions and the optimization of our digital support and delivery structure. Reservoir Performance revenue of $1.8 billion was flat sequentially as higher intervention activity in international markets was offset by lower evaluation revenue in Latin America and the Middle East. Margins contracted 53 basis points due to the unfavorable technology mix. Well Construction revenue of $3.3 billion decreased 3% sequentially on lower rig count in U.S. land and Saudi, and the completion of drilling projects in certain offshore markets. Margins decreased 19 basis points as a result of the lower activity. Finally, Production Systems revenue of $3.1 billion increased 3% sequentially driven by higher sales of surface production systems, completions, and artificial lift, led by North America and the Middle East & Asia. Margins expanded 110 basis points to 16.7% on improved profitability in artificial lift, completions, surface and midstream production systems. With regard to our liquidity, our cash flow performance during the third quarter was very strong, as we generated $2.4 billion of cash flow from operations and free cash flow of $1.8 billion. This represents a $1 billion increase in free cash flow as compared to last quarter, largely due to significant customer collections. Capital investments, inclusive of CapEx and investments in APS projects and exploration data, were $644 million in the third quarter. For the full year, we are still expecting capital investments to be approximately $2.6 billion. On the M&A front, as announced yesterday, I am pleased to report that we have signed a definitive agreement to sell our interests in the Palliser APS project in Canada. This transaction will reduce our direct exposure to commodity prices and the associated earnings volatility as well as reduce our capital intensity. It also allows us to eliminate significant future abandonment liabilities. Under the terms of the agreement, we will receive cash proceeds of approximately $430 million U.S. dollars, subject to closing adjustments that are typical for such a transaction. This transaction will also result in us removing asset retirement obligations from our balance sheet with a present value of approximately $280 million. This transaction, which is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, is expected to close before the end of this year. Turning to the pending ChampionX acquisition, the integration teams on both sides have been working together closely, and we are extremely pleased with the progress they are making. We now anticipate the transaction to more likely close in the first quarter of 2025. Finally, total returns to shareholders, in the form of stock repurchases and dividends, was approximately $2.4 billion on a year-to-date basis. During the third quarter, we repurchased 11.3 million shares for a total purchase price of $501 million. As a result of our strong cash flow performance, we expect to maintain this level of buyback in the fourth quarter. Consequently, we will exceed our previous commitment to return $3 billion to our shareholders in 2024. Furthermore, we reaffirm that we will return a minimum of $4 billion to shareholders in 2025, reflecting our confidence in our ability to continue generating strong cash flows. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier. Yes. First, we do see not only in Q4 and into 2025, further margin expansion on that upstream spending outlook. And as you actually mentioned, it comes from several components. It comes primarily, I would say, from the mix of activities in our various divisions. As Olivier indicated, digital is a booster to our overall company margins, technology mix, performance contract or performance in general pushes margins as well. And yes, there's an element of cost optimization, not only from the program, we started at the end of last quarter -- sorry, at the beginning of last quarter of Q3, but also from our continuous focus on cost, we will continue to adjust delivery resources based on level activities, and we will continue to look for further optimization in our structure. So, it's a mix of all these components that will continue to push our margins into 2025. Yes. So, we -- on Palliser, we generate approximately $500 million of revenue per year on the asset. And this comes with pretax margins in the in the high 30s. Now you mentioned something very important. It also removes quite a bit of investment that we need to inject every year to maintain this number. So, it's the CapEx is about $150 million per year. And as I mentioned as well in my prepared remarks, something not to underestimate is removing future abandonment liabilities, which discounted are about $280 million, but undiscounted are close to $1 billion. So that's -- it's a good thing. This is going away from our balance sheet and P&L, and it will reduce both earnings volatility and capital intensity. So makes sense, Neil. So really, yes, again, margin expansion is -- we are laser focused on this. We've been increasing EBITDA margins for year-on-year for 15 consecutive quarters, and we don't intend to stop. So, this is our mission. And as I explained, it's made of several types of components. Now to your specific question on 2025 and the absolute value of EBITDA compared to our long-term '21 to '25 CAGR ambition, it is possible that indeed, with the current macro outlook again to be refined, and if we exclude for the moment just to compare apples to apples, with apple, sorry, if we exclude ChampionX, it's possible that the '21 to '25 CAGR will finish in the high teens rather than breaking that 20% bar. Yes, totally. So yes, we maintain capital discipline for sure. So, this is -- this is quite predictable, and it's a bit too soon to talk about CapEx for next year, but rest assured it's going to -- the theme of capital discipline, clearly, will be there considering the macro environment. So now specifically to our Q3 free cash flow, yes, always in the second half, we generate most of the year of free cash flow. And in Q3, this was in a way more than exacerbate here. So yes, Q3 was very strong. And as we highlighted and as you mentioned, it's really -- it was really driven by customer collections. In a way Q2 was a little bit low on collections, so there's a bit of a catch-up effect. And Q4 will essentially be dependent on will be strong. It will also be dependent on customer collection. But as you can see, we do experience volatility in those collections from a quarter to another. So, we'll continue to push. We'll definitely finish the year high note as it relates to working capital and free cash flow work will continue to release as we finish the year. And going into next year, again, a bit too soon to give you a number for free cash flow, but definitely, it will be higher than 2024, not only from us, but of course, with the addition of ChampionX. And this is why we are quite comfortable to reaffirm or $4 billion target returns to shareholders for next year because free cash flow will increase in '25. Yes. I think in all cycle at any point in the cycle, I think we will always get under competitive pressure and under pressure from our customers to lower the cost of operation or improve product value. We believe that, I think, first and foremost, as long as we continue to perform credit value and exceed expectation on the performance of our operation, will relieve that any pressure that could come from a competitive and/or from a customer aspect. Secondly, we believe that the industry is tight on capacity, capacity of equipment, capacity of critical new technology. And the industry has demonstrated lately a strong capital discipline that has restrained this risk, I would say. But as long as I think -- as long as we maintain a very high customer satisfaction through our performance, continue to our technology, continue to deliver our integrated value proposition, I think we will relieve any pressure that could arise into a moderating growth environment and defend our pricing and further improve our pricing when it has it matters, and hence protect our margins going forward. So, it's a matter of execution. It's a matter of relationship, but it's also a matter of capital discipline across the industry. And I believe the condition in this cycle is a bit different than what we have suffered in the past, and I'm looking at this constructively. Well, you know, it is true. We set the minimum a few years back of 50%. So, yes, we have clearly exceeded that, and I'm quite happy we were actually able to exceed that. So, I mean, it really depends on investment opportunity. I think 80% is already a very good number. It's hard to tell you if it can get to 100% in 2025. I mean, it's really. We are happy with where our balance sheet is. Deleveraging has been a focus for a few years. We have turned that focus from deleveraging to return. So, depending on investment opportunities, returns to shareholders remains the priority at the moment. So, yes, you will see that percentage clearly above our initial short guidance of 50%. That's for sure. So, it's clearly different from our core business. There's a little lag or a reasonable lag between investment CapEx in our core business and the related deployment of the tool in the field. In digital, it's a much longer cycle. So first, it's not CapEx. As you know, we expense all the investments because the investments are basically -- you can categorize them if you want, in product development, research and development, and this has been done over tempted to say the last years. So, there's always, of course, to come up with new solutions to enrich the platform. We need to continue investing every year. But we are not seeing spikes in there. We make our bit tragedies within given a lot. So, our growth in digital doesn't trigger incremental capital intensity because it's really smooth over many, many years. I would say that the heavy investments have been made in the past already now is just enriching the platform and supporting the enriched offering for the customer. Well, we are -- as we said, we have been working quite a bit on both sides with the integration teams, and what we are seeing is really giving us even more confidence than we had originally on the transaction and on the synergies. So, we are not going to change our synergy target at this time, but we clearly confirm it, and we are quite happy with what we are seeing in that integration planning process."

            "name": "Olivier Le Peuch",
            "content": "Thank you, James. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us this morning. During the call, I will cover a few topics. I'll start by reviewing our third-quarter results. Then, I will discuss how we are leveraging our differentiated market positioning, digital leadership, and operating efficiency to navigate the evolving macro environment. And finally, I will provide an update on our full-year financial ambitions and our early outlook for 2025. Stephane will then provide additional details on our financial results, and we will open the line to your questions. Let's begin. SLB delivered strong third quarter results with continued margin expansion. Sequentially, although revenue was flat, we expanded our adjusted EBITDA margin by more than 50 basis points to 25.6% by driving efficiencies throughout the business and we generated very strong free cash flow of $1.81 billion. In the international markets, revenue remained steady sequentially despite lower reactivity as commodity prices resulted in a more cautious approach to discretionary short cycle spending. Demand for SLB's digital products and services continued to accelerate and we saw continued growth in the Middle east and Asia, fueled by oil capacity expansions and strong gas activity as well as offshore projects. Meanwhile, revenue in Europe and Africa was largely unchanged as strong production and recovery activity in North Africa was offset by a decline in Latin America following a strong second quarter. Turning to North America, revenue increased 3% sequentially as higher offshore activity in the Gulf of Mexico was partially offset by lower drilling activity in U.S. land as the market remained constrained by gas prices and ongoing capital discipline by operators. Next, let me touch on the performance of the Divisions. In Digital & Integration, we delivered strong sequential growth led by our digital business, which reached a new quarterly revenue high. We also continued to increase profitability, expanding our pretax segment operating margin to 36%, driven by higher digital revenue and cost optimization. Overall, our digital business remains on pace to achieve full-year revenue growth in the high teens, and we announced a number of exciting new products and partnerships during the quarter that I will discuss a little later in today's call. Turning to the Core divisions, Production Systems continues to grow, benefitting from long-cycle development activity, particularly in the Middle East & Asia and in the Gulf of Mexico. I was proud to see that most Production Systems business lines contributed to this performance, as we continued to secure sizable bookings, while also increasing our backlog for the future. Reservoir Performance remained steady, supported by stable production and recovery spending, and Well Construction declined slightly, due to weaker land activity in North America and in the international markets. Overall, these results demonstrate SLB's unique ability to navigate the evolving market by leveraging our differentiated international and offshore positioning, our broad technology portfolio, and our continued focus on capital discipline and operating efficiency. I want to thank the SLB team for continuing to deliver for our customers and shareholders in this dynamic environment. I am extremely proud of their contribution and dedication to our performance strategy. Next, I wanted to share some updates on our progress in digital. We delivered another quarter of strong digital growth as operators continued to increase their investments in digital technology to reduce cycle times and risk, enhance productivity, lower costs and carbon, and accelerate returns. This is presenting opportunities for high margin growth, and we have taken a leading role in this space, partnering with our customers to accelerate their transition to the cloud, scaling new technology for drilling and production operations, and creating new markets by delivering disruptive solutions for data and AI. As part of this journey, we hosted our Digital Forum in September, where we brought more than 1,000 customers and partners to innovate solutions and shape our shared digital future. During this event, we launched the Lumi data and AI platform, which will accelerate advanced data and generative AI capabilities at scale for SLB's customers across the energy value chain. Today, we offer approximately 150 AI and machine learning capabilities across our products and solutions, and we continue to work with our customers and partners to innovate and deploy new ones. We also unveiled a number of cross-industry announcements during the Forum. Theis includes a collaboration with NVIDIA to develop generative AI solutions for energy, as well as a partnership with Amazon Web Services to expand access to applications from the Delfi digital platform and to evaluate decarbonization solutions for Amazon's digital infrastructure. Each of these agreements helps to expand our capability set and positions SLB as a key partner in digital and sustainability across the industry. Next, let me discuss the macro environment. Over the past few months, commodity prices have been under pressure. This is largely due to concerns of an oversupplied market, driven by higher output from non-OPEC+ producers, uncertainty around OPEC+ supply releases, weaker demand from China, and softer economic growth rates in the U.S. and Europe. This has resulted in a cautionary approach to activity and discretionary spend by many customers as highlighted in our third-quarter results. Despite these evolving market conditions, we believe the long-term fundamentals for oil and gas remain in place. Demand for energy is increasing and energy security remains a global priority, as witnessed by recent commodity price fluctuations tied to geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. In this environment, gas will continue to play an increasing role in the energy transition, while oil will remain a large part of the energy mix for decades to come. Internationally, gas investment remains strong, particularly in Asia, the Middle East, and the North Sea, and is expected to grow regardless of OPEC+ decisions on oil production. Meanwhile, while short-cycle oil investments have been more challenged, long-cycle deepwater projects globally and most capacity expansion projects in the Middle East remain economically and strategically favorable. Specific to North America, we do not see U.S. activity rebounding in the near term, and any potential increases in gas rigs could be quickly offset by a further decline in oil rigs due to increased operating efficiency. Overall, we expect this to result in a sustained level of global upstream investment in the years to come, with the secular trends of digital and industry decarbonization extending the investment horizon. SLB is well positioned to navigate in this evolving macroenvironment through our differentiated portfolio and multipronged strategic approach across Core, Digital, and New Energy. With that backdrop, let me conclude my opening remarks by sharing our outlook for the full year 2024 and our early thoughts regarding 2025. Specific to the fourth quarter, we expect muted revenue growth, with a favorable mix of year-end digital and product sales partially offset by E&P budget exhaustion in U.S. land and cautious discretionary spending from certain international customers. And, with continued cost optimization, we anticipate we will deliver EBITDA margin expansion in the fourth quarter. For the full year of 2024, ongoing margin expansion will enable us to deliver full-year adjusted EBITDA margins at or above 25%. Additionally, our strong cash flows, coupled with the announced sale of our Palliser asset in Canada, will support increased returns to our shareholders. In 2025, we see the potential for upstream spending in the international markets to grow in the low to mid-single digits, while North America spending will be flat to slightly down. This directional outlook will depend on the geopolitical environment and commodity prices, and we will share an updated view in January after we receive more feedback on customer budgets. In conclusion, SLB remains well positioned to deliver strong financial results, as our optimized cost structure, portfolio rationalization, differentiated exposure to key international and offshore markets, and digital leadership will support further margin expansion, higher cash generation, and increased returns to shareholders. I will now turn the call over to Stephane. Thank you, Stephane. Ladies and gentlemen, we will open the floor to your questions. Yes. Good question. Thank you, James. So yes, indeed, we have the ambition to maintain our margin expansion journey as we enter 2025 or exit rate of 2024, with the results we have delivered in Q3, the ambition we have and the statement we have made on further expansion in the fourth quarter will bode very well as we enter 2025 to start the year with a kick if I may. And now looking forward, I think the guidance at this point, market spend will indicate that they will benefit from another year of international growth outpacing North America, which again and plays in our favor from the margin mix. And obviously, the combination of our digital tech -- technology premium will continue to play favorably as we accelerate technology introduction and continue the journey and ambition, we have on the on digital to reach approximately $3 billion on the and some of a year of strong growth. And finally, I think we have initiated some cost out and operating efficiency focus for our team, entire team and this is already falling through into our results, and I expect this to take full scale in 2025. No, fair. I think first, I'm very pleased to report that this was most likely on many aspects, our best forum ever. And from the size, the scale of the attendance, number of partners that came to join us, the number of customers that came and display their own technology. I think we're having the opportunity -- we had the opportunity to show the digital value proposition we offer in industry across the different domains from [geoscience] subsurface to operations, show it that we have an integrated platform, open platform approach with partners, and they are extending our technology from the historical on-prem to cloud edge and now AI, including Gen AI. So, I think this resulted into not realization by many customers that we can impact all aspects of the operation, unlock value in productivity, in the geoscience space, in operation for performance, and in reducing cost and carbon going forward. So, the pickup, if any, that I have is that this market in terms of TAM will expand going forward with accelerated expansion as customers realize that there is maturity into offering. There is maturing to the partnership ecosystem that we have developed. And there is opportunity for them to capture this as they want to extract efficiency as they want to be more competitive. And I believe that our opportunity is to accelerate the adoption of the toolbox that we have invested in the last 10 years to particularly benefit from digital operation. There is one domain that I think has really blossomed in the last 18 months is digital operation in production, in drilling, autonomous operation, optimization, edge AI applications that are really game changing the way we can perform with our customers, and that's where I see the future. So longer term, going beyond the cycle, growing for the long term as a business for us. Yes, I think you have seen the realization that when commodity price is under pressure, there is some pressure on short cycle that is suppressed and that may come back and will come back as soon because it impacts increased drilling, impacts intervention activity, it impacts short cycle and commercial in some region, but it will most likely come back as soon as the community price regain traction. But the long cycle, apart from some decision on timing and project execution have been untouched. And we have had a year of strong exploration activity that has unlocked new reserve, that has appraised new future pipeline of deepwater, as you have heard and seen across Americas, across South Africa, across the East Mediterranean and across Asia, where gas is critical. And the combination of these, as you know, is representing every year. This year, I think the total offshore FID will approach $100 billion, and we expect that this rate of $100 billion the FID for offshore will remain at that level or higher for the next two or three years. So, the cumulative over '23 to '26 of offshore will exceed $500 million of offshore FID and that's a sign that this project will execute beyond '25, beyond '26 and will be a growth engine for the industry going forward. It is already. I think we are already deploying our well construction automation and optimization, autonomous operations in some offshore rigs and making huge defense where the cost of rig operation matters, and this is something that will unlock the future. But I think I will split in the three categories. I think you have a platform transition, cloud transition that has happened that affects the more than 1,000, 1,500 customers we have, and it's a long transition that will continue to happen one customer at a time, cloud transition that will continue to drive our Delfi adoption across our customer space in [geoscience], and we'll continue to see this affecting and being a long cycle, a long period of growth for years to come as a driver. The second is, as you mentioned, as I mentioned, the digital operation, be it in production and drilling with the emergence of edge application, the emergence of autonomous optimization application, and this is both seen by the digital services that our core divisions offering, well construction, production system and reservoir performance with having much success with this digital offering that they are putting on the back of our Delfi, and we see it into the pickup of our production and drilling operation capability by the customers themselves. And finally, and the third leg of growth in our digital portfolio, is the emergence of new data and AI capability, as you have seen, the Lumi that we have put in place. So, we combine these three over the future horizon. This will continue to be digital. As a consequence, we continue to be a growing TAM for us and will be an engine of growth that will be accretive to the top line and will deliver accretive margin to the Company. So that's the way we see it. And I will not, at this point, set the target for the risk next, but we'll continue to see growth between '25 with this context. I think we believe that the pricing environment is still positive, constructive, I would say. I think first, realizing that the industry is capital discipline. And the industry has no spare capacity to move and to place. And as a consequence, performance, technology and integration capabilities still give us opportunity to support our pricing, and I don't see it in the current environment changing very much. Well, as you pointed out, I think first, we are very pleased to have achieved these milestones again, the milestone has been to produce lithium carbonate from our demonstration plant in Nevada using direct lithium extraction from brine and using a concentration and purification process that we have integrated with our own IP and using some external technology and putting this together and working for months to tune it to digitally optimize it and to realize this. So, our plan forward is to work with prospective partners and customers. to see how this technology can be used and to respond to big demand that exists and some plans that some of our customers and partners have announced to use DLE as a method to extract lithium and produce in large quantity in the coming years. So, we are looking forward to technology to scale it for application as a license technology or as a partner where we will develop and run going forward this technology with our customers and partners. That's the way we look into it. And again, very good first and benchmark performance for such a DLE plant and exciting prospect -- long-term prospect for us in this new space. I think the customers were, I think, first, many of them participated themselves and 150 papers were presented by our customers, more than 10 of them presented their own application of digital to other customers. So, I think it was from a lot of learnings for customers to watch each other and to learn from each other and how do they use digital technology to unlock value. So, if take away, I think, at a high, high level, I think customer realized that we are more than just one [geoscience] application on the cloud, and we have a digital value proposition that expands across different domains and across different technology stack on-prem, cloud, edge AI and across the different dimension sensing and production. So, the full value proposition we have on digital, I think did surprise many of the customers as we continue to expand and have now a very comprehensive offering. That's the first takeaway, I think. The second is, I think the emergence of AI as x-factor for the industry to unlock more value of digital. This industry is data rich, I would say. And hence, we have deployed, as you heard, 150 engineered AI full of domain, full of physics, and full of the latest data science technique to unlock more performance into our digital application. And the latest announcement of Lumi as a platform that complements Delfi, and as a platform for putting an access in all E&P data in one framework to integrate all the applications across seamlessly. And finally, to create a framework that allow customer to use AI application on their datasets across the different domains and unlock new insights or create new performance. That's sort of Lumi data and AI is getting a lot of inbound requests as we have just announced it, and it will certainly be a factor of growth in the future as the industry recognized that there is a lot to unlock from data to liberate data and to realize value through AI including Gen AI application that we develop as you have heard with partners like NVIDIA, Mistral and others. I think as we are very early in the curve of adoption of digital, I believe, they are largely uncorrelated at this point. And we see the TAM, total addressable market of digital in our industry, in upstream actually growing as the market may be moderating from upstream CapEx. We believe that the size of digital will actually, by contrast, grow. And our ability to not only participate fully, but also gain share in this market and unlock white space in this market, such as with Lumi data and AI, and offer edge autonomous operation, I think will create for us a long growth opportunity that will be largely decorated. Now, there are aspects of short term, I would say, discretionary decision on that can affect digital. But I think the long trend, I think, I believe is positive and long trend will continue to be a secular investment opportunity for customers that now they're realizing creates value today and hence is an opportunity to differentiate their performance for tomorrow. No, Roger, thanks for the question. I think there's nothing new. I think we have been working on going and understanding what can we do to unlock both from the go-to-market and from our own internal capability the digital growth. And I think we have been more success in the last few quarters. And I think it comes down to, I think engaging for customers, better understanding what I think, offering they are looking for. And I think this -- the going for multi-cloud going from hybrid cloud environment, on-prem and cloud, I think, has been an evolution that we have taken two to three years back, and I think it's paying off and is unlocking the growth. The other realization is that some customers don't necessarily are focused on the application, but I focus on data and they are willing to sort out and unlock the data. Hence, the operation of Lumi as a platform to address the customers that are more interested into unlocking data and directly accessing AI through a data platform as opposed to having to adopt the full suite. And I think we have seen this. We have done investment into our innovation factory to help collaborate for customers to tailor some fit-for-basin application to their needs. So, we have already gone through this. Is it all of cycle resolved? No. I think, as I said, it's one customer at a time, adoption on the cloud. However, I think there's something that help us a lot and I think is accelerating is the fact that digital operation led by our core division, production system, well construction and reservoir performance are becoming new agents of digital transformation for our customers, as they are pushing and getting successful into the adoption of digital services that are being delivered real time at the edge, such as autonomous drilling operation or wellbore insights or surveillance and optimization of some of our production system equipment. And this is one well at the time. This is one transaction at the time. So, the rate of adoption here, I think, and a push we have made to coalesce, if I may, are offering in the office, in the planning to offering into operation and at least under one umbrella of platform, I think, is unlocking the pace of adoption. And hence, we see this happening today, and we believe this will continue. So that's what we are doing to unlock, if you like, and working with partners to provide more options to our customers so that they recognize the ecosystem they work with. So, these are the two or three dimensions that we have worked with in the last 18 months, two or three years, and that are starting to bear fruits and starting to transfer into growth, and we don't see it changing going forward. Not sure we got your second question. You are concerned about -- the second part of your question. So, I will start with this to say that we have seen muted impact on the Gulf of Mexico storm in our operation, and the Gulf of Mexico has been a driver for growth in the third quarter sequentially. As it comes to the fourth quarter and your question, I think the puts and takes, I think, yes, there is an element of seasonality, both on the positive side, which is the digital and product from production system year-end sales that will normally and will create a boost to our revenue. And there is a seasonality effect on some part of the Nova atmosphere that are starting to see either part of the sequence or budget exhaustion part in U.S. land we see an offset and I think these two, as we commented, will be partially offset and we see as a consequence muted growth going forward sequentially. But that's the puts and takes that we are seeing going forward. Thank you, Leah. Ladies and gentlemen, as we conclude today's call, I would like to leave you with the following takeaways: First, SLB remains well positioned to navigate commodity price fluctuations, benefiting from our unique operating footprint. Moving forward, we will continue to harness our technology deployment and integration capabilities to capture high margin opportunities in the international, deepwater, and gas markets. Second, our digital business remains a key differentiator in the industry. This will continue to drive higher margin growth while opening the door to new markets. And third, with our solid financial performance and focus on operating efficiency, we look forward to delivering further margin expansion, higher cash generation, and increased returns to shareholders. Thank you for joining us this morning. With that, I will conclude our call."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to James R. McDonald, Senior President of Investor Relations and Industry Affairs. Please go ahead.\nJames McDonald: Thank you, Leah. Good morning, and welcome to the SLB second quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Today's call is being hosted from London following our board meeting held earlier this week. Joining us on the call are Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Executive Officer; and Stephane Biguet, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind all participants that some of the statements we'll be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. For more information, please refer to our latest 10-K filing and other SEC filings, which can be found on our website. Our comments today also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our second quarter press release, which is on our website. And finally, in conjunction with our proposed acquisition, SLB and ChampionX have filed materials with the SEC, including the registration statement with the proxy statement and prospectuses. These materials can be found on the SEC's website or from the parties' websites. With that, I will turn the call over to Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, James. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on the call. This was a very strong second quarter for SLB, showcasing our ability to harness the ongoing growth cycle while driving efficiencies throughout our business. During today's call, I will cover three topics. First, I will review our second quarter results. Then I will describe the dynamics of the cycle and how we are positioning our business for further growth and margin expansion. Finally, I will share our updated outlook for the full year and discuss our ongoing commitment to returns to shareholders. Stephane will then provide additional details on our financial results, and we will open the line for your questions. Let's begin. I'm very pleased with our strong second quarter performance. Sequentially, revenue increased 5%. Adjusted EBITDA grew 11%. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 142 basis points, and we generated $776 million of free cash flow. These results were driven by continued growth momentum in international markets, with more than half of our international geo units posting the highest revenue quarter of the cycle. Overall, international revenue grew 6% sequentially, led by the Middle East and Asia, which continued to set new records with two-thirds, 8 out of 12, of the year units in the area posting record high quarterly revenue. This was fueled by capacity expansion projects, new gas developments and production and recovery investments across the region. Additionally, the ongoing strength of the offshore markets supported further growth in Europe and Africa as well as Latin America. This was particularly pronounced in deepwater basins, including Brazil, West Africa and Norway, where we continued to benefit from strong backlog conversion in OneSubsea. We also benefited from new project on land, notably in Argentina and North Africa. Meanwhile, in North America, revenue increased 3% sequentially. This was led by the Gulf of Mexico, where we saw increased running and higher digital revenue from sales of exploration data licenses. However, this sequential growth was partially offset by lower drilling in U.S. land as the market continues to be constrained by weaker gas prices, capital discipline and ongoing market consolidation. Next, let me describe how this growth played out across the divisions. In our core divisions, we continue to harness this cycle, with revenue growing 4% sequentially and pretax segment operating margins expanding by 120 basis points. Growth was led by our Production Systems and Reservoir Performance divisions, which visibly expanded margins due to the favorable conversion of backlog as well as many business line operating and record activity levels. Demand for our services and equipment is being further reinforced by the combination of long-cycle development activity and the acceleration of production recovery investments, particularly in the Middle East and Asia and Latin America. Well construction also grew sequentially, supported by offshore developments, although this was partially offset by weaker land activity in North America. Overall, the core divisions continue to deliver margin expansion, combining to post their 14th consecutive quarter of year-on-year pretax segment operating margin expansion. Meanwhile, in Digital & Integration, I was very pleased to see highly accretive sequential growth, highlighted by our digital business, reaching a new quarterly high and supporting visible sequential margin expansion. This puts us on track to achieve our full year ambition of digital revenue growth in the high-teens. We have opportunities to build on this momentum as customers are increasingly choosing to partner with SLB to modernize their digital infrastructure, as you have seen in a number of announcements included in today's release. At the end of the second quarter, we had 6,900 users on the Delfi platform, an increase of 28% year-on-year. Additionally, the number of connected assets increased by 57%, and trailing 12-months compute hours increased by 43%. Combined with our first quarter results, SLB first half adjusted EBITDA grew in mid-teens compared to the same period last year, in line with our full year ambition. Moving forward, we will remain focused on driving quality revenue growth and leveraging operational efficiency to grow EBITDA, expand operating margins, generate robust cash flows and meet our commitment to return to shareholders. I'm here to clearly express my full gratitude to the entire SLB team for delivering such a strong second quarter and first half results. Next, let me describe how the market is evolving and the steps we are taking to capture profitable growth across the business. As the cycle continues, investments will increasingly be targeted to in the most resilient area of the market, including key international markets such as the Middle East and Asia and in offshore globally. In these areas, we are seeing long-cycle gas and deepwater projects, production and recovery activity to address natural decline and increased digital adoption to drive efficiency and performance. This is an optimal environment for our business, and we are seizing each of these opportunity. In the Middle East, in addition to the exposure to the oil capacity expansion program across the region, we continue to benefit from the acceleration and scale of investments in gas development, both conventional and unconventional, leveraging our fit-for-basin technology and differentiated integration capability. Offshore, we see the benefits of our OneSubsea JV as highlighted by the number of high value contracts awarded and partnership included in today's release. Through OneSubsea, we're helping customers unlock reserves and reduce cycle times through an extensive subsea production processing technology portfolio. And we are increasingly being offered the opportunity to partner with customers in early engineering phases to unlock the economics of the assets. In production and recovery, we are seeing customers embrace our offerings as they work to offset natural decline, extend performance and maximize the value of their producing assets. We have many solutions to help customers access resource to our production system and reservoir performance division, and this is showing up in the strong results these divisions are achieving. As this market continue to evolve, we expect to strengthen our portfolio to fully capture this growing opportunity through our pending acquisition of ChampionX. Finally, underpinning nearly everything we do is the power of digital and AI. In today's market, accelerating the time to returns and extracting new level of efficiency are top of mind for our customers. And they are increasingly recognizing that upscaling their digital infrastructures is key, is a key enabler in these areas, presenting us with significant opportunities for high margin growth. In summary, SLB is well-positioned across key resilient markets. We remain focused on expanding margins through quality revenue growth, and this is complemented by heightened focus on operating efficiency, support structure optimization and strategic resource allocation in certain markets to align with expected levels of activity going forward. To support these ongoing cost efficiency actions, we recorded a charge this quarter, and Stephane will share additional details on this topic later in the call. Overall, the positive market dynamics and our continued focus on operating efficiency present a strong backlog for continued outperformance. We look forward to enhancing these dynamics to deliver further growth and margin expansion in the second half of 2024 and in 2025. On that note, let me conclude my opening remarks by showing our updated outlook for the year. Based on our strong second quarter and first half results, we expect full year adjusted EBITDA growth in the range of 14% to 15% and full year adjusted EBITDA margins at or above 25%. Specific to the third quarter, we expect sequential revenue growth in the low single-digits, enhanced by further margin expansion. This will accelerate as we move towards the end of the year, with visible increase in top-line growth and an uptick in margin expansion during the first quarter due to seasonally higher year end digital and product sets. Lastly, we've returned $1.5 billion to shareholders over the first quarter, through the combination of stock repurchase and dividends. In the second half of the year, we expect to generate higher EBITDA and strong cash flows, supporting our full year commitments. Directionally, we expect a strong exit of the year to position us for continued revenue growth, margin expansion and cash generation, reinforcing our commitment to continue returns to shareholders in 2025. I will now turn the call over to Stephane.\nStephane Biguet: Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Overall, our second quarter revenue of $9.1 billion, increased 5% sequentially, mostly driven by the international markets, led by the Middle East and Asia. Sequentially, our pre-tax segment operating margins expanded 135 basis points to 20.3%, as margins increased in each of our four divisions. Company-wide adjusted EBITDA margin for the second quarter was 25%, representing a sequential increase of 142 basis points. In absolute dollars, adjusted EBITDA increased 11% sequentially and 17% year-on-year. As a result, second quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.85. This represents an increase of $0.10 sequentially and $0.13 or 18%, when compared to the second quarter of last year. During the quarter, we've recorded $0.01 of merger and integration charges relating to the Aker subsea transaction and $0.07 of charges in connection with a program that we have recently, started to realign and optimize the support and service delivery structure in certain parts of our organization. This includes adjusting resources as a result of lower activity levels in North America, centralizing certain digital delivery services and improving efficiency in our support structure. This program, which will result in additional charges in the third quarter, will drive further margin expansion in the second half of the year and into 2025. The related actions will be completed by the end of the year. Let me now go through the second quarter results for each division. Second quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $1.1 billion increased 10% sequentially, with margins expanding 435 basis points to 31%. The sequential revenue growth was entirely due to higher digital sales, as APS revenue was flat. The strong margin performance was driven by improved digital profitability, as a result of robust exploration data sales and the higher uptake of digital solutions. APS margins were essentially flat. We expect the digital revenue growth and margin expansion to continue in both Q3 and Q4. Reservoir performance revenue of $1.8 billion increased 5% sequentially, while margins improved 98 basis points to 20.6%. These increases were primarily due to strong growth internationally, led by higher activity in the Middle East and Asia. Well construction revenue of $3.4 billion increased 1% sequentially, well margins of 21.7% increased 125 basis points, driven by strong measurements and fluids activity internationally. Finally, production systems revenue of $3 billion increased 7% sequentially, driven by the strong activity in the international markets led by Europe and Africa. Margins expanded 146 basis points to 15.6% on improved profitability in Subsea Production Systems and artificial lift. Now turning to our liquidity. Our cash flow was strong, as we generated $1.4 billion of cash flow from operations and free cash flow of $776 million during the quarter. We expect our cash flow to continue to improve throughout the rest of the year. As a result, our free cash flow in the second half of this year will be materially higher than the first half. Capital investments, inclusive of CapEx and investments in APS projects and exploration data, were $666 million in the second quarter. For the full year, we are still expecting capital investments to be approximately $2.6 billion. As I mentioned last quarter, under the securities laws, we were prohibited from repurchasing our stock during the period between the mailing of the proxy in connection with the ChampionX acquisition and ChampionX's shareholders' vote. Following the shareholder vote in June, we have resumed our stock repurchase program. And during the quarter, we repurchased 9.9 million shares for a total purchase price of $465 million. During the first half of the year, total returns to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases and dividends were approximately $1.5 billion, representing half of our $3 billion commitment for all of 2024. Finally, we issued $1.5 billion of bonds during the second quarter. The proceeds either have been or will be used to refinance our debt obligations. We are pleased with our current capital structure, which allows us to prioritize returns to shareholders, as illustrated by our $3 billion total returns commitment for 2024 and our $4 billion commitment for 2025. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Stephane. And ladies and gentlemen, I believe we will open the floor for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of James West with Evercore ISI.\nJames West: Good morning Olivier and Stephane. Olivier, I know in your guidance for the year, you didn't used the word or highlight raise, but it seems like there was a slight EBITDA guide raise. I guess, one is, am I correct in that? And two, is the guidance for \u201825 that you'd already laid out, I guess, now starting from a bit higher base, the numbers need to kind of move up across the board?\nOlivier Le Peuch: No. That's a fair assessment and a fair reading of our guidance in the prepared remarks. We have originally been guiding the EBITDA growth year-on-year in the mid-teens and we have here confirmed that, as we have delivered the second quarter and foresee further margin expansion in the second half driven by the different factor we highlighted, we still foresee the EBITDA growth year-on-year to be now in the range of 14% to 15%. Hence, I believe this is indeed a very solid outlook for EBITDA growth year-on-year and in line with our previous guidance, but certainly on the back of international margin expansion. The success we have had in the second quarter, we expect to carry on, as we continue to execute with greater revenue and favorable market position in the second half.\nJames West: And then maybe just a quick follow-up for me. It seems like international, we obviously know offshore looks great, but international land, particularly in the Middle East, across the Middle East, whether it's KSA or UAE, looks like expansion is going to be significantly or going to be strong. Maybe it's not much above your expectations, but very, very strong growth. Could you maybe highlight what you're seeing in the Middle East right now across the region? If there's any particular projects that make sense to highlight, I'd love to hear that.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yes. I think it's fair to say that, we see a large breadth of growth engine across the region, Middle East and also North Africa, driven by a combination of all capacity expansion program that I think you may know are still in full swing in many countries, including KSA, but most visibly the UAE, the Kuwait and Iraq are running after and Libya, are running after visible oil capacity expansion program and activity as such is indeed going up. The addition of large conventional and unconventional gas projects that are being accelerated in several countries to respond to local demand and to desire to transition. I think we are seeing it obviously in Saudi and we commented a lot on this before. You may have seen into the earnings press release that, we have been awarded an extension and the large markets for our drilling services for the unconventional program in Saudi. We continue to fully participate into the other country where this is very relevant including UAE committing to accelerate their own commercial, including Qatar that continue to expand and including Algeria that is starting to look back and clearly having a path forward to also activity increase. All across the Middle East, we see growth year-on-year. We see, as I said, the vast majority of the GeoUnit having record revenue for this cycle and for many record ever activity. Hence, we benefit from this very large growth and multiple levels of activity growth in the Middle East and we foresee it continuing going forward.\nOperator: Next we go to the line of David Anderson with Barclays.\nDavid Anderson : Hey, good morning, gentlemen. I want to talk about the key resilient markets that you mentioned a few times that are driving SLB's growth going forward. I was wondering if you could give us kind of your longer-term views on global natural gas markets, and how they're developing. And kind of maybe your demand assumptions through the end of the decade. Because I noticed that there was a number of contracts and awards that you're hiring were natural gas, so for unconventional Qatar, Egypt. So I'm just wondering, is your -- are you expecting your overall mix of business to shift towards natural gas in the coming years? Is that already happening?\nOlivier Le Peuch: No. I will be -- I will say that more generically as we see resilience on 3 aspects, resilience on the steel oil capacity expansion and deepwater oil developments happening and having significant resilience. And you may foresee not an existing deepwater program in oil in the Latin Americas region, but you will see emerging new oil developments coming into Africa. So that's a strong resilient aspect of deepwater. You see and you can anticipate a gas resilience in deepwater development more in the Isthmeb, Turkey and Asia region. And then you have the complex of indeed Middle East that is both reinforcing their oil capacity, as I mentioned. And gas so it's not only one market. I think gas, we have increased our share of gas activity in Middle East visibly. We are very well exposed. I would say we are long on gas in the Middle East region. And we believe that it's a matter of offshore long cycle, both oil and gas, Middle East oil capacity and on commercial gas developments and Asia for gas security reason, offshore development for gas as well. So it's a mix that is favorable. And then we should not forget about North America that I think has continued high intensity technology deployment to support sustained production growth for oil, particularly in the short term.\nDavid Anderson : So if I could dig in a little bit more on the offshore. You had highlighted OneSubsea's performance this quarter, with the backlog conversion. We saw a number of announcements as well during the quarter on the OneSubsea. I was wondering, could you talk a little bit about the order book, how that's shaping up this year's date compared to last year? And just kind of overall your offshore portfolio, are you expecting growth to start to accelerate in the next couple of quarters and into 2025?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think we see the market of deepwater. I think you have two markets. You have the market offshore shallow that is highly concentrated in Middle East and to the States and in Asia. And then you have the deepwater market that is consolidated in Americas, Africa and some part of Asia and Isthmeb. And I think what we see, if you look at more generically, we see three legs of activity developing for the future of deepwater, large and offshore, large, but deepwater in particular. There is a strong portfolio of projects underway from Guyana to Brazil, from Norway to part of Asia that we'll continue to complete and develop to the next two or three years and are part of the portfolio of subsea deployment that we have across. Then you have an ongoing set of FID, and we expect that offshore FID this year will be reaching $100 billion exceeding this and the same for 2025. And this FID is led by a combination of oil, a lot of oil FID being developed and being nearing decision in the coming months and some have just been approved and you have seen some of the announcements in Patria and Angola. We are very pleased with this because that would feed our pipeline of subsea going forward. And lastly, we should not forget that there is a third leg. The third leg is coming from exploration and appraisal activity that is not only happening in Namibia or not only happening in Brazil or in Suriname or in Asia, but I think it's very strong across many basin in frontier region as well as in infrastructure led exploration. We believe that, this third leg will certainly add quarters, if not years of growth to the deepwater outlook. Hence, we are very confident on our exposure to the deepwater market. To the offshore market at large, as we commented before that, offshore represent about 50% of our revenue exposure internationally and we see it extremely resilient and we see multiple legs in the deepwater market going forward.\nOperator: Next we go to the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup.\nScott Gruber: Good morning. Wanted to ask about how you think about segmenting the portfolio next year when ChampionX comes in. I guess the heart of the question is, you have this awesome digital business, it's growing rapidly, it's going to be $3 billion or so in revenues next year. Does the ChampionX acquisition provide opportunity for you to think about re-segmenting the portfolio to further highlight the digital business?\nOlivier Le Peuch: First, I cannot comment, obviously, as you understand, where we stand on the -- with regulatory process and usual process clearance on the ChampionX. But obviously, we are looking at the way we could at the time of the closing and restructure and get better exposure to the digital if we can do this in a way that will indeed expose and provide a little bit more direct measurement of our success and ambition going forward in digital. That's the integration team looking into it and we will make decision in due time and inform you.\nScott Gruber: Okay. We will wait for the details, but good to hear. And then you mentioned low single-digit revenue growth in 3Q and continued margin expansion, but it does sound like the margin expansion potential may be stronger into 4Q, with those year-end sales. Can you just provide a bit more color on how you see the margin expansion potential shaping up for 3Q? And then, if you want to, any additional color on 4Q?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yes. We would expect that, on the low single-digit global growth sequentially in the fourth quarter to still increase our margin expansion and not give more precise guidance. We expect an uptick in the fourth quarter, driven first by an acceleration of our top-line sequential growth in the fourth quarter, in part due to the year-end effect of product sales in both software, digital and in some of our equipment division. This will lead to acceleration also our margin expansion, giving us a very good exit point if you like, as we enter 2025, an ambition to continue growth, as I mentioned and further expand the margin. That's setting the scene very well as we conclude the year with the guidance we have shared and preparing 2025 an overview of growth and margin expansion.\nOperator: Next we go to Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.\nArun Jayaram: Good morning, Olivier. You highlighted margin expansion for SLB through quality revenue growth, digital and efficiency gains. I was wondering if you could maybe elaborate on just the concept of quality revenue growth, what you're referring to there and just maybe some of the plans to boost efficiency. I assume there's some cost structure alignment going on at the company, maybe you can give us some more thoughts on that?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yeah. I think quality revenue growth is focusing selectively on we believe -- where we believe we have the most operational leverage, the most pressing upside and the most technology adoption potential to suit our growth with higher accretive margin and hence to support our margin ambition expansion going forward. We have demonstrated this fairly well in the second quarter. We continue to focus on this selectively. The market internationally remains tight and it favors the best performer from execution and we'll use this to deploy technology, fit-for-basin technology, use our unique integration capability and spice it up, if I may, with digital capability to increase and improve our margin going forward. So that's where we look at what we call quality revenue growth. And indeed, we have taken some measure to further support this by adjusting and relooking at our support structure and where we could and we should adjust to prepare for supporting our growth and adjusting our asset to fit where we see the most resilience going forward. So that has been also contributing and will continue to contribute to margin expansion going forward.\nArun Jayaram: That's helpful. Just a follow-up on D&I, your margins rebounded to 31%. You reiterated your high-teens growth outlook for digital. I was wondering if you could maybe give us a sense of D&I margin progression over the balance of the year and just how you're thinking about the APS business broadly in Canada in terms of SLB's broader portfolio.\nStephane Biguet: So yes, we were quite happy with the not only the top-line growth, but the margin expansion in the D&I division in the second quarter. And as I said earlier, it was all due to the digital business. So, APS was flat. And as it relates to the rest of the year, we do definitely expect the digital margins to continue improving in the second half. It will accelerate even more so in the fourth quarter on higher sales, but also on the effect of the changes we are making in the digital delivery and support organization to pull resources on a more global and regional basis to scale the business more efficiently. So as it relates to the APS business, again, it's always it is mostly flat quarter-on-quarter. So all the upside is coming from digital. And your question on Canada, I think we have signaled before that we were looking at divesting the asset and it's very much the case. We have actually reached -- we have launched a formal process again. We are quite happy with the results. So we will move to the second phase of this process, which is that we had several offers. We have shortlisted -- selected set of buyers and we are moving to negotiation with the selected set of buyers. It's so far so good. It's going well on this process and we'll update you later.\nOperator: Next we go to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.\nNeil Mehta: Yes. Good morning, team. Olivier, I'd love your perspective on deepwater markets and offshores, particularly given some of the incremental investment in Subsea? And just how -- maybe you can characterize the different regions where deepwater is growing and what activity you're seeing and how that fits into your long-term strategy?\nOlivier Le Peuch: It's a longer for better outlook first. It's a market that has multiple legs, as I said. Actually, if I start to list all the deepwater basins currently under production in future FID and future exploration, I think it would be a long list. What characterized this cycle, it is very broad in term of region of the world and deepwater basins that are being either explored and that are being redeveloped. I think there is there are two or three fundamental reasons for this. First and foremost is that, the deepwater assets from be it oil or gas typically geologically very strong asset and advantaged assets. Hence, they received utmost focus and priority when the IOCs are high grade in our portfolio. They typically concentrate on some of these assets, followed by select international independents and some NOCs for which deepwater is their backyard and their center of expertise. We see FID growth, we see exploration growth and we see existing deepwater basin very solid going forward, hence very resilient and multi finger and multi legs, I would say, outlook for deepwater. That's quite unique. It's not one basin. It's constrained by some rig capacity and it's shifting to the right to some extent, but it's longer for better. It's elongating if I would say, as a deepwater market and for the good, because it\u2019s -- we have new basins emerging like Namibia. We have basin being FID like Suriname. We have a lot of explore activity in Asia, many parts of Asia with some gas success and discovery in Indonesia particularly. We still have the hot East Med or Turkey basin and we have new oil being explored in South Angola or in South of Brazil in the new Pelotas Basin. It's all hot and it's very diverse, and not forgetting about the deep formation into the Gulf of Mexico coming back and if not Mexico as well in the South of the Gulf. More work into the future, more bookings in the future, and I think a very key and regional market for us, as we are very exposed to that offshore deepwater.\nNeil Mehta: Thank you. The follow-up is just around return of capital. Obviously, some of the dynamics around ChampionX precluded you from buying back as much stock as you probably wanted to in the last quarter, but seems like you're leaning into it. Just talk about your return of capital intentions and how you're thinking about taking advantage of any dislocation that might exist in the stock?\nStephane Biguet: Neil, we did try to take the most advantage of this by resuming very quickly our stock buybacks in June right after the shareholders vote. We were able to accelerate there and actually catch up on to the point where we go to just about half of our full year commitment. So the commitment remains the same for 2024 at this moment. It's a total of $3 billion between dividends and buybacks. We will continue to monitor our cash flow, continue to look at our capital allocation. For example, potential cash proceeds from divestitures depending on their timing can be an upside to buybacks. But for the moment, the target for \u201924 remains $3 billion.\nOperator: And our next question is from Dan Kutz with Morgan Stanley.\nDan Kutz: Hey, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask a question more generally on M&A. I'd love to get a sense of kind of your appetite as it stands today for incremental acquisitions, given that you guys have been pretty active recently? And to the extent that that's still that M&A ranks high on your capital allocation priority list, would just love if you could talk about some of the characteristics that you would look for and potential targets. It seems like, the theme of the recent acquisitions was kind of stability, longevity and growth, given that they were kind of production or new energy related. Just hoping you could kind of give us your latest thoughts on your M&A appetite.\nStephane Biguet: Thanks, Dan. So you mentioned we've been quite active indeed. So at this stage, we are really focusing on making those acquisitions and various transactions from Aker Subsea to Aker Carbon Capture to the planned acquisition of ChampionX as a success. So we are the focus currently is more on integration than on new M&A. And really in terms of prioritization in for the capital allocation at this moment, we are really prioritizing returns to shareholders.\nDan Kutz: Great. That's helpful. And then that kind of is a good lead into my next question. So on Aker Carbon Capture specifically, I mean, we can see the financials of the standalone entity. I think the revenue growth has revenue has nearly doubled the last two years. I don't think folks are doubting the top-line growth story or growth potential for that business. But can you just talk about some opportunities to kind of drive margin improvement, given following the transaction and given the resources of SLB combined with Aker Carbon Capture?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Dan. So first, I would comment maybe stepping up on the CCS as a market. I think we see this as a very attractive market for us considering the adjacency on the sequestration and considering the integration capability we have acquired and the technology we have acquired through Aker Carbon Capture. So the market independently and at this point, we see this market growing at more than 50% a year. And I'm very accretive to our growth. And we don't see this slowing down necessarily soon. And obviously, the addition of Aker Carbon Capture give us an opportunity to participate at scaling market where Aker Carbon Capture was not exposed to, partly in North America, where we're getting a lot of inbound requests as we form this combination, unique combination with what we have invested into our own capture technology with carbon capture commercial technology, we are seeing a lot of inbound requests and we have been awarded and part of two DOE-funded projects in North America and another shipping ban request from a company that are exploring and/or pursuing some carbon capture in North America. We see the same in Middle East. This will complement the strong pipeline that Aker Carbon Capture has already developed in Europe with three active projects and most likely more to come. We see that, we will combine our strengths in technology deployment at scale in every basin in the world, combining this with the subsurface sequestration technology leadership we have to offer customers an all in capability from sequestration design execution to carbon capture, combining our technology with the technology of our carbon capture. We are very positive on this and we believe that, as this business will scale, as we will be in a position to add on many new innovation technology on it, this will result into margin expansion and into ability to extract a lot of value from this acquisition.\nOperator: Next, we go to Luke Lemoine with Piper Sandler.\nLuke Lemoine: Hi. Good morning. Arun touched on it a little earlier with his question, but you mentioned cost efficiency programs a couple of times in the release. It sounded like maybe these were primarily support costs. First, is that correct? Secondly, would it be possible to maybe frame the magnitude of these?\nStephane Biguet: Thanks for the question, Luke. Really this program is about extracting the most margin expansion and returns out of this growth cycle. It's not just support, even though it's one of the key element of it. You have three main components. First, there's a more tactical adjustment, if you want, of our operational resources in mostly in U.S. land to account basically for the lower-than-expected rig count levels. The second one relates to digital. We are centralizing or regionalizing a certain number of delivery services to improve resource utilization, so that we can better respond to the rapid adoption of our digital solutions. Indeed the third one, not a small component, about half of it if you want, is increasing efficiency in our functional superstructure. It's something we do all the time. But here, we are completing the deployment of our new ERP system. We really want to extract the most out of this and it allows us to streamline some of the superstructure. In terms of magnitude, you've seen the charge this quarter. It's slightly over $100 million pretax. I don't expect that, this will exceed this amount in the third quarter. We are still in the process of finalizing all the plans. I cannot give you a number on that, but it should not be of a bigger magnitude. Then this will result in great savings and optimization of our cost lines, which you will see gradually towards the end of the year and of course in 2025.\nOperator: Next we go to Saurabh Pant with Bank of America.\nSaurabh Pant: Hi, good morning, Olivier and Stephane. I guess, I just want to go back to the OneSubsea joint venture, especially on the all-electric, the groundbreaking award you announced with Norway. That's a big deal, I think, from both a technical and a commercial opportunity standpoint. Olivier, if you don't mind spending a little time on that, how should we think about that opportunity unfolding? What are the constraint, especially on the regulatory side of that? Just talk to the opportunity on just that all electric subsea side of things.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yes. This is a great question, Saurabh. We are very excited. We are very excited because we believe this is one of the leg of technology deployment that could change the game in the long-term and in the subsea infrastructure deployment. First, because it allows a lower footprint, a smaller footprint, reducing and eliminating hydraulics into the subsea and eliminate -- ultimately eliminating cost. And secondly, allowing full digital control of the subsea infrastructure. And last, obviously, having an impact onto the carbon footprint of this infrastructure. So we believe that for recovery, cost and low carbon, we believe that there is a future for our deepwater all-electric bid on the subsurface. And as you have seen, we you might have seen that we have announced earlier in the year and last year that we have made progress and being awarded several contracts on a completion subsurface all-electric solution. I will continue to lead in this domain and combine it with all-electric subsidiary or subsea infrastructure that then when combined together with the subsurface give us an opportunity to fully digitize and fully control and provide our customers and the operators the ability to optimize recovery and control and optimize the maintenance as well in this field. So that's part of the future of deepwater is electric and we're very pleased to have been awarded this as a result of our consortium actually, [Indiscernible] for other operators. So this will take place in several basins we believe, in particular in Brazil and another place and we'll be ready to deploy this for our customers.\nSaurabh Pant: Okay. That's fantastic color, Olivier. Maybe I have a quick unrelated follow-up on the D&I side of things. I think in the press release, you mentioned in a couple of places about just the second quarter being held by exploration data license sales. I know these tend to be lumpy, but is there anything to read into this on what's happening on the exploration side of things? It does sound there are more exploration around across the globe, but is it just lumpiness in the second quarter? Or is there anything we can read into on just where exploration is going?\nOlivier Le Peuch: No. I think the trend has been up, and I think it has been contributing in line with our ambition for digital growth as the data exploration sales has been a success. And we foresee this to continue to grow going forward in the quarters to come. Sometime, it will be up and sometime it will be slightly down, but we foresee a growth and I think this is driven by the frontier exploration. This is driven by infrastructure led exploration in natural basins and this is driven by new generation of software digital application that can relook an existing basin and extract more value for understanding and finding new hydrocarbon and or new gas finds into the existing basins. So, we're very pleased to have a leading offering both in term of digital capability to repossess existing data sets and also to be able to enhance the vintage data sets and to be having this in the right basin and the right place and parts linked too many of these licensing rounds. You're right to say that, many licensing round expected this year, no less than actually 70 licensing rounds are being announced across many parts of the world and I think some of them have been highly successful. Deepwater has been a success for critical finds and critical hydrocarbon, both oil and gas in the last few quarters and we expect this to continue. There's increased interest into the Apollo pass, which is the last hot spot South of Brazil. You have the Namibe Basin south of Angola, North of Namibia. You have Indonesia, India. You have Bangladesh, you have many, many spots that are being discovered and being explored with fresh data sets and the opportunity to indeed boost and support our participation to this market going forward. I think we will continue to participate and maximize this, and this will be, on occasion, lumpy, but we believe this will continue to grow.\nSaurabh Pant: Perfect. No, that's a very thorough answer, Olivier. I know you have made this business as an asset-light, so it's accretive to your returns to your margins. That's all very good to hear. Thank you. Olivier. I'll turn it back.\nOperator: Next, we go to Marc Bianchi with TD Cowen.\nMarc Bianchi: Thank you. I didn't catch if you said, but could you update us on your outlook for international and North America revenue growth in 2024?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think we have been guiding earlier this year. We remain fit on this guidance that, internationally, we foresee double-digit growth when excluding Aker and Russia. North America, we have been guiding originally positive up to mid-single growth and we have been realizing this down as the North America has been clearly impacted going forward. But, we still have opportunity to grow in the second half and to improve our margin as well in this basin as we adjust our resource and get the most out of deepwater market in Gulf of Mexico as well as our participation with technology intensity in some part of the North American land market. No change international and lower growth in North America, compared to original guidance.\nMarc Bianchi: Yes. Makes sense. Maybe for Stephane, back on the cost savings, you mentioned that another charge in 3Q not to exceed what we saw in second quarter for the actions you're taking. Can you help us with how much of a profit uplift or cost saving benefit you may get on a quarterly basis in the back half of the year and then once everything finally reaches its full implementation?\nStephane Biguet: Yes. Sure. As I said, we will really complete everything. All the actions will be taken by the end of the year. But you will see gradually the effect on our margins in the second half. By the way, this is of course why we are confident in the updated, more precise guidance we gave for the full year EBITDA. We will update you more precisely on the savings once we are done at the end of Q3. In general, as a rough rule of thumb, if you want, you can assume that, the payback on these actions is between 9 to 12 months.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Kurt Hallead with Benchmark.\nKurt Hallead: Thanks for fitting me in here. Appreciate the insights as always. Olivier, I think from my standpoint, Olivier, I'm kind of curious, right? We've now had five or six months or so to kind of digest the shift in game plan by Saudi Arabia from offshore to ton of conventional gas. You kind of, referenced that very explicitly in your commentary about unconventional gas being a growth market for you. But I guess from where I sit, right, we're five or six months into this process. What have you picked up incrementally with respect to that opportunity? And more importantly, what kind of legs do you see for that dynamic for you in Saudi in particular?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think you may have been reading and don't want to speak on behalf of Saudi Aramco, but I think their commitment to their program to increase gas production by 60% from 2020 is very clear. I think this touched both the conventional and unconventional gas reserve in Saudi. The most visible element of this is obviously the unconventional gas large Jafurah project. You may have seen they've also explored successfully new finds, both oil and gas, in the recent months. So, the country is set to expand in gas to complement their oil capacity, sustained capacity and slight expansion. And we are -- as I said, favorably exposed, and we have reinforced this exposure, strengthened this exposure with our recent wins, as you may have seen in the earnings press release from this morning. So, we're very pleased. But the market is not only one project. The market is not only one aspect. The market is much more diversified in Saudi and furthermore in Middle East. So, we are exposed to many aspects of the Saudi activity, both production and recovery, exploration, CCS, as well as, well construction and production equipment, both offshore and onshore. So we are very -- we have a very diversified exposure to this, and we benefit favorably to the exposure of the growth accelerated growth in Jafurah. So, we're very pleased to where we are. And we are one of the most beneficiary of the accelerated gas expansion as highlighted in our EPR highlights. So that's where we stand.\nKurt Hallead: Great. That's great color. Always appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: And I'll now be turning the call back to Olivier for closing remarks.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you. Thank you, Leah. So ladies and gentlemen, as we conclude today's call, I would like to leave you with the following takeaways. First, the growth momentum continues with many of our international [GeoUnits] reaching new cycle highs. Combined with the increased adoption of digital technologies, the stage is set for further growth and margin expansion throughout the rest of 2024 and into 2025. Second, in this environment, no company is better positioned than SLB to capture quality growth. Our differentiated operating footprint, leading technical and digital offerings and sustained commitment to operating efficiency and value creation have set us apart throughout the cycle. Moving ahead, we remain favorably positioned in the highest quality area of the market, supported by our differentiated technology deployment, integration capabilities and performance. And third, with a strong first half of the year behind us and full confidence in further international revenue growth, we are optimally positioned to continue our margin expansion journey to generate cash and to fulfill our commitment to return to shareholders both in 2024 and in 2025. This is an excellent environment for our business, and I'm confident that we will continue to deliver outstanding performance for our customers and our shareholders in the quarters ahead. With that, I will conclude this morning's call. Thank you very much for joining.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Stephane Biguet",
            "content": "Thank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Overall, our second quarter revenue of $9.1 billion, increased 5% sequentially, mostly driven by the international markets, led by the Middle East and Asia. Sequentially, our pre-tax segment operating margins expanded 135 basis points to 20.3%, as margins increased in each of our four divisions. Company-wide adjusted EBITDA margin for the second quarter was 25%, representing a sequential increase of 142 basis points. In absolute dollars, adjusted EBITDA increased 11% sequentially and 17% year-on-year. As a result, second quarter earnings per share, excluding charges and credits, was $0.85. This represents an increase of $0.10 sequentially and $0.13 or 18%, when compared to the second quarter of last year. During the quarter, we've recorded $0.01 of merger and integration charges relating to the Aker subsea transaction and $0.07 of charges in connection with a program that we have recently, started to realign and optimize the support and service delivery structure in certain parts of our organization. This includes adjusting resources as a result of lower activity levels in North America, centralizing certain digital delivery services and improving efficiency in our support structure. This program, which will result in additional charges in the third quarter, will drive further margin expansion in the second half of the year and into 2025. The related actions will be completed by the end of the year. Let me now go through the second quarter results for each division. Second quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $1.1 billion increased 10% sequentially, with margins expanding 435 basis points to 31%. The sequential revenue growth was entirely due to higher digital sales, as APS revenue was flat. The strong margin performance was driven by improved digital profitability, as a result of robust exploration data sales and the higher uptake of digital solutions. APS margins were essentially flat. We expect the digital revenue growth and margin expansion to continue in both Q3 and Q4. Reservoir performance revenue of $1.8 billion increased 5% sequentially, while margins improved 98 basis points to 20.6%. These increases were primarily due to strong growth internationally, led by higher activity in the Middle East and Asia. Well construction revenue of $3.4 billion increased 1% sequentially, well margins of 21.7% increased 125 basis points, driven by strong measurements and fluids activity internationally. Finally, production systems revenue of $3 billion increased 7% sequentially, driven by the strong activity in the international markets led by Europe and Africa. Margins expanded 146 basis points to 15.6% on improved profitability in Subsea Production Systems and artificial lift. Now turning to our liquidity. Our cash flow was strong, as we generated $1.4 billion of cash flow from operations and free cash flow of $776 million during the quarter. We expect our cash flow to continue to improve throughout the rest of the year. As a result, our free cash flow in the second half of this year will be materially higher than the first half. Capital investments, inclusive of CapEx and investments in APS projects and exploration data, were $666 million in the second quarter. For the full year, we are still expecting capital investments to be approximately $2.6 billion. As I mentioned last quarter, under the securities laws, we were prohibited from repurchasing our stock during the period between the mailing of the proxy in connection with the ChampionX acquisition and ChampionX's shareholders' vote. Following the shareholder vote in June, we have resumed our stock repurchase program. And during the quarter, we repurchased 9.9 million shares for a total purchase price of $465 million. During the first half of the year, total returns to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases and dividends were approximately $1.5 billion, representing half of our $3 billion commitment for all of 2024. Finally, we issued $1.5 billion of bonds during the second quarter. The proceeds either have been or will be used to refinance our debt obligations. We are pleased with our current capital structure, which allows us to prioritize returns to shareholders, as illustrated by our $3 billion total returns commitment for 2024 and our $4 billion commitment for 2025. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier. So yes, we were quite happy with the not only the top-line growth, but the margin expansion in the D&I division in the second quarter. And as I said earlier, it was all due to the digital business. So, APS was flat. And as it relates to the rest of the year, we do definitely expect the digital margins to continue improving in the second half. It will accelerate even more so in the fourth quarter on higher sales, but also on the effect of the changes we are making in the digital delivery and support organization to pull resources on a more global and regional basis to scale the business more efficiently. So as it relates to the APS business, again, it's always it is mostly flat quarter-on-quarter. So all the upside is coming from digital. And your question on Canada, I think we have signaled before that we were looking at divesting the asset and it's very much the case. We have actually reached -- we have launched a formal process again. We are quite happy with the results. So we will move to the second phase of this process, which is that we had several offers. We have shortlisted -- selected set of buyers and we are moving to negotiation with the selected set of buyers. It's so far so good. It's going well on this process and we'll update you later. Neil, we did try to take the most advantage of this by resuming very quickly our stock buybacks in June right after the shareholders vote. We were able to accelerate there and actually catch up on to the point where we go to just about half of our full year commitment. So the commitment remains the same for 2024 at this moment. It's a total of $3 billion between dividends and buybacks. We will continue to monitor our cash flow, continue to look at our capital allocation. For example, potential cash proceeds from divestitures depending on their timing can be an upside to buybacks. But for the moment, the target for '24 remains $3 billion. Thanks, Dan. So you mentioned we've been quite active indeed. So at this stage, we are really focusing on making those acquisitions and various transactions from Aker Subsea to Aker Carbon Capture to the planned acquisition of ChampionX as a success. So we are the focus currently is more on integration than on new M&A. And really in terms of prioritization in for the capital allocation at this moment, we are really prioritizing returns to shareholders. Thanks for the question, Luke. Really this program is about extracting the most margin expansion and returns out of this growth cycle. It's not just support, even though it's one of the key element of it. You have three main components. First, there's a more tactical adjustment, if you want, of our operational resources in mostly in U.S. land to account basically for the lower-than-expected rig count levels. The second one relates to digital. We are centralizing or regionalizing a certain number of delivery services to improve resource utilization, so that we can better respond to the rapid adoption of our digital solutions. Indeed the third one, not a small component, about half of it if you want, is increasing efficiency in our functional superstructure. It's something we do all the time. But here, we are completing the deployment of our new ERP system. We really want to extract the most out of this and it allows us to streamline some of the superstructure. In terms of magnitude, you've seen the charge this quarter. It's slightly over $100 million pretax. I don't expect that, this will exceed this amount in the third quarter. We are still in the process of finalizing all the plans. I cannot give you a number on that, but it should not be of a bigger magnitude. Then this will result in great savings and optimization of our cost lines, which you will see gradually towards the end of the year and of course in 2025. Yes. Sure. As I said, we will really complete everything. All the actions will be taken by the end of the year. But you will see gradually the effect on our margins in the second half. By the way, this is of course why we are confident in the updated, more precise guidance we gave for the full year EBITDA.

            "name": "Olivier Le Peuch",
            "content": "Thank you, James. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on the call. This was a very strong second quarter for SLB, showcasing our ability to harness the ongoing growth cycle while driving efficiencies throughout our business. During today's call, I will cover three topics. First, I will review our second quarter results. Then I will describe the dynamics of the cycle and how we are positioning our business for further growth and margin expansion. Finally, I will share our updated outlook for the full year and discuss our ongoing commitment to returns to shareholders. Stephane will then provide additional details on our financial results, and we will open the line for your questions. Let's begin. I'm very pleased with our strong second quarter performance. Sequentially, revenue increased 5%. Adjusted EBITDA grew 11%. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 142 basis points, and we generated $776 million of free cash flow. These results were driven by continued growth momentum in international markets, with more than half of our international geo units posting the highest revenue quarter of the cycle. Overall, international revenue grew 6% sequentially, led by the Middle East and Asia, which continued to set new records with two-thirds, 8 out of 12, of the year units in the area posting record high quarterly revenue. This was fueled by capacity expansion projects, new gas developments and production and recovery investments across the region. Additionally, the ongoing strength of the offshore markets supported further growth in Europe and Africa as well as Latin America. This was particularly pronounced in deepwater basins, including Brazil, West Africa and Norway, where we continued to benefit from strong backlog conversion in OneSubsea. We also benefited from new project on land, notably in Argentina and North Africa. Meanwhile, in North America, revenue increased 3% sequentially. This was led by the Gulf of Mexico, where we saw increased running and higher digital revenue from sales of exploration data licenses. However, this sequential growth was partially offset by lower drilling in U.S. land as the market continues to be constrained by weaker gas prices, capital discipline and ongoing market consolidation. Next, let me describe how this growth played out across the divisions. In our core divisions, we continue to harness this cycle, with revenue growing 4% sequentially and pretax segment operating margins expanding by 120 basis points. Growth was led by our Production Systems and Reservoir Performance divisions, which visibly expanded margins due to the favorable conversion of backlog as well as many business line operating and record activity levels. Demand for our services and equipment is being further reinforced by the combination of long-cycle development activity and the acceleration of production recovery investments, particularly in the Middle East and Asia and Latin America. Well construction also grew sequentially, supported by offshore developments, although this was partially offset by weaker land activity in North America. Overall, the core divisions continue to deliver margin expansion, combining to post their 14th consecutive quarter of year-on-year pretax segment operating margin expansion. Meanwhile, in Digital & Integration, I was very pleased to see highly accretive sequential growth, highlighted by our digital business, reaching a new quarterly high and supporting visible sequential margin expansion. This puts us on track to achieve our full year ambition of digital revenue growth in the high-teens. We have opportunities to build on this momentum as customers are increasingly choosing to partner with SLB to modernize their digital infrastructure, as you have seen in a number of announcements included in today's release. At the end of the second quarter, we had 6,900 users on the Delfi platform, an increase of 28% year-on-year. Additionally, the number of connected assets increased by 57%, and trailing 12-months compute hours increased by 43%. Combined with our first quarter results, SLB first half adjusted EBITDA grew in mid-teens compared to the same period last year, in line with our full year ambition. Moving forward, we will remain focused on driving quality revenue growth and leveraging operational efficiency to grow EBITDA, expand operating margins, generate robust cash flows and meet our commitment to return to shareholders. I'm here to clearly express my full gratitude to the entire SLB team for delivering such a strong second quarter and first half results. Next, let me describe how the market is evolving and the steps we are taking to capture profitable growth across the business. As the cycle continues, investments will increasingly be targeted to in the most resilient area of the market, including key international markets such as the Middle East and Asia and in offshore globally. In these areas, we are seeing long-cycle gas and deepwater projects, production and recovery activity to address natural decline and increased digital adoption to drive efficiency and performance. This is an optimal environment for our business, and we are seizing each of these opportunity. In the Middle East, in addition to the exposure to the oil capacity expansion program across the region, we continue to benefit from the acceleration and scale of investments in gas development, both conventional and unconventional, leveraging our fit-for-basin technology and differentiated integration capability. Offshore, we see the benefits of our OneSubsea JV as highlighted by the number of high value contracts awarded and partnership included in today's release. Through OneSubsea, we're helping customers unlock reserves and reduce cycle times through an extensive subsea production processing technology portfolio. And we are increasingly being offered the opportunity to partner with customers in early engineering phases to unlock the economics of the assets. In production and recovery, we are seeing customers embrace our offerings as they work to offset natural decline, extend performance and maximize the value of their producing assets. We have many solutions to help customers access resource to our production system and reservoir performance division, and this is showing up in the strong results these divisions are achieving. As this market continue to evolve, we expect to strengthen our portfolio to fully capture this growing opportunity through our pending acquisition of ChampionX. Finally, underpinning nearly everything we do is the power of digital and AI. In today's market, accelerating the time to returns and extracting new level of efficiency are top of mind for our customers. And they are increasingly recognizing that upscaling their digital infrastructures is key, is a key enabler in these areas, presenting us with significant opportunities for high margin growth. In summary, SLB is well-positioned across key resilient markets. We remain focused on expanding margins through quality revenue growth, and this is complemented by heightened focus on operating efficiency, support structure optimization and strategic resource allocation in certain markets to align with expected levels of activity going forward. To support these ongoing cost efficiency actions, we recorded a charge this quarter, and Stephane will share additional details on this topic later in the call. Overall, the positive market dynamics and our continued focus on operating efficiency present a strong backlog for continued outperformance. We look forward to enhancing these dynamics to deliver further growth and margin expansion in the second half of 2024 and in 2025. On that note, let me conclude my opening remarks by showing our updated outlook for the year. Based on our strong second quarter and first half results, we expect full year adjusted EBITDA growth in the range of 14% to 15% and full year adjusted EBITDA margins at or above 25%. Specific to the third quarter, we expect sequential revenue growth in the low single-digits, enhanced by further margin expansion. This will accelerate as we move towards the end of the year, with visible increase in top-line growth and an uptick in margin expansion during the first quarter due to seasonally higher year end digital and product sets. Lastly, we've returned $1.5 billion to shareholders over the first quarter, through the combination of stock repurchase and dividends. In the second half of the year, we expect to generate higher EBITDA and strong cash flows, supporting our full year commitments. Directionally, we expect a strong exit of the year to position us for continued revenue growth, margin expansion and cash generation, reinforcing our commitment to continue returns to shareholders in 2025. I will now turn the call over to Stephane. Thank you, Stephane. And ladies and gentlemen, I believe we will open the floor for your questions. No. That's a fair assessment and a fair reading of our guidance in the prepared remarks. We have originally been guiding the EBITDA growth year-on-year in the mid-teens and we have here confirmed that, as we have delivered the second quarter and foresee further margin expansion in the second half driven by the different factor we highlighted, we still foresee the EBITDA growth year-on-year to be now in the range of 14% to 15%. Hence, I believe this is indeed a very solid outlook for EBITDA growth year-on-year and in line with our previous guidance, but certainly on the back of international margin expansion. The success we have had in the second quarter, we expect to carry on, as we continue to execute with greater revenue and favorable market position in the second half. Yes. I think it's fair to say that, we see a large breadth of growth engine across the region, Middle East and also North Africa, driven by a combination of all capacity expansion program that I think you may know are still in full swing in many countries, including KSA, but most visibly the UAE, the Kuwait and Iraq are running after and Libya, are running after visible oil capacity expansion program and activity as such is indeed going up. The addition of large conventional and unconventional gas projects that are being accelerated in several countries to respond to local demand and to desire to transition. I think we are seeing it obviously in Saudi and we commented a lot on this before. You may have seen into the earnings press release that, we have been awarded an extension and the large markets for our drilling services for the unconventional program in Saudi. We continue to fully participate into the other country where this is very relevant including UAE committing to accelerate their own commercial, including Qatar that continue to expand and including Algeria that is starting to look back and clearly having a path forward to also activity increase. All across the Middle East, we see growth year-on-year. We see, as I said, the vast majority of the GeoUnit having record revenue for this cycle and for many record ever activity. Hence, we benefit from this very large growth and multiple levels of activity growth in the Middle East and we foresee it continuing going forward. No. I will be -- I will say that more generically as we see resilience on 3 aspects, resilience on the steel oil capacity expansion and deepwater oil developments happening and having significant resilience. And you may foresee not an existing deepwater program in oil in the Latin Americas region, but you will see emerging new oil developments coming into Africa. So that's a strong resilient aspect of deepwater. You see and you can anticipate a gas resilience in deepwater development more in the Isthmeb, Turkey and Asia region. And then you have the complex of indeed Middle East that is both reinforcing their oil capacity, as I mentioned. And gas so it's not only one market. I think gas, we have increased our share of gas activity in Middle East visibly. We are very well exposed. I would say we are long on gas in the Middle East region. And we believe that it's a matter of offshore long cycle, both oil and gas, Middle East oil capacity and on commercial gas developments and Asia for gas security reason, offshore development for gas as well. So it's a mix that is favorable. And then we should not forget about North America that I think has continued high intensity technology deployment to support sustained production growth for oil, particularly in the short term. I think we see the market of deepwater. I think you have two markets. You have the market offshore shallow that is highly concentrated in Middle East and to the States and in Asia. And then you have the deepwater market that is consolidated in Americas, Africa and some part of Asia and Isthmeb. And I think what we see, if you look at more generically, we see three legs of activity developing for the future of deepwater, large and offshore, large, but deepwater in particular. There is a strong portfolio of projects underway from Guyana to Brazil, from Norway to part of Asia that we'll continue to complete and develop to the next two or three years and are part of the portfolio of subsea deployment that we have across. Then you have an ongoing set of FID, and we expect that offshore FID this year will be reaching $100 billion exceeding this and the same for 2025. And this FID is led by a combination of oil, a lot of oil FID being developed and being nearing decision in the coming months and some have just been approved and you have seen some of the announcements in Patria and Angola. We are very pleased with this because that would feed our pipeline of subsea going forward. And lastly, we should not forget that there is a third leg. The third leg is coming from exploration and appraisal activity that is not only happening in Namibia or not only happening in Brazil or in Suriname or in Asia, but I think it's very strong across many basin in frontier region as well as in infrastructure led exploration. We believe that, this third leg will certainly add quarters, if not years of growth to the deepwater outlook. Hence, we are very confident on our exposure to the deepwater market. To the offshore market at large, as we commented before that, offshore represent about 50% of our revenue exposure internationally and we see it extremely resilient and we see multiple legs in the deepwater market going forward. First, I cannot comment, obviously, as you understand, where we stand on the -- with regulatory process and usual process clearance on the ChampionX. But obviously, we are looking at the way we could at the time of the closing and restructure and get better exposure to the digital if we can do this in a way that will indeed expose and provide a little bit more direct measurement of our success and ambition going forward in digital. That's the integration team looking into it and we will make decision in due time and inform you. Yes. We would expect that, on the low single-digit global growth sequentially in the fourth quarter to still increase our margin expansion and not give more precise guidance. We expect an uptick in the fourth quarter, driven first by an acceleration of our top-line sequential growth in the fourth quarter, in part due to the year-end effect of product sales in both software, digital and in some of our equipment division. This will lead to acceleration also our margin expansion, giving us a very good exit point if you like, as we enter 2025, an ambition to continue growth, as I mentioned and further expand the margin. That's setting the scene very well as we conclude the year with the guidance we have shared and preparing 2025 an overview of growth and margin expansion. Yeah. I think quality revenue growth is focusing selectively on we believe -- where we believe we have the most operational leverage, the most pressing upside and the most technology adoption potential to suit our growth with higher accretive margin and hence to support our margin ambition expansion going forward. We have demonstrated this fairly well in the second quarter. We continue to focus on this selectively. The market internationally remains tight and it favors the best performer from execution and we'll use this to deploy technology, fit-for-basin technology, use our unique integration capability and spice it up, if I may, with digital capability to increase and improve our margin going forward. So that's where we look at what we call quality revenue growth. And indeed, we have taken some measure to further support this by adjusting and relooking at our support structure and where we could and we should adjust to prepare for supporting our growth and adjusting our asset to fit where we see the most resilience going forward. So that has been also contributing and will continue to contribute to margin expansion going forward. It's a longer for better outlook first. It's a market that has multiple legs, as I said. Actually, if I start to list all the deepwater basins currently under production in future FID and future exploration, I think it would be a long list. What characterized this cycle, it is very broad in term of region of the world and deepwater basins that are being either explored and that are being redeveloped. I think there is there are two or three fundamental reasons for this. First and foremost is that, the deepwater assets from be it oil or gas typically geologically very strong asset and advantaged assets. Hence, they received utmost focus and priority when the IOCs are high grade in our portfolio. They typically concentrate on some of these assets, followed by select international independents and some NOCs for which deepwater is their backyard and their center of expertise. We see FID growth, we see exploration growth and we see existing deepwater basin very solid going forward, hence very resilient and multi finger and multi legs, I would say, outlook for deepwater. That's quite unique. It's not one basin. It's constrained by some rig capacity and it's shifting to the right to some extent, but it's longer for better. It's elongating if I would say, as a deepwater market and for the good, because it's -- we have new basins emerging like Namibia. We have basin being FID like Suriname. We have a lot of explore activity in Asia, many parts of Asia with some gas success and discovery in Indonesia particularly. We still have the hot East Med or Turkey basin and we have new oil being explored in South Angola or in South of Brazil in the new Pelotas Basin. It's all hot and it's very diverse, and not forgetting about the deep formation into the Gulf of Mexico coming back and if not Mexico as well in the South of the Gulf. More work into the future, more bookings in the future, and I think a very key and regional market for us, as we are very exposed to that offshore deepwater. Thank you, Dan. So first, I would comment maybe stepping up on the CCS as a market. I think we see this as a very attractive market for us considering the adjacency on the sequestration and considering the integration capability we have acquired and the technology we have acquired through Aker Carbon Capture. So the market independently and at this point, we see this market growing at more than 50% a year. And I'm very accretive to our growth. And we don't see this slowing down necessarily soon. And obviously, the addition of Aker Carbon Capture give us an opportunity to participate at scaling market where Aker Carbon Capture was not exposed to, partly in North America, where we're getting a lot of inbound requests as we form this combination, unique combination with what we have invested into our own capture technology with carbon capture commercial technology, we are seeing a lot of inbound requests and we have been awarded and part of two DOE-funded projects in North America and another shipping ban request from a company that are exploring and/or pursuing some carbon capture in North America. We see the same in Middle East. This will complement the strong pipeline that Aker Carbon Capture has already developed in Europe with three active projects and most likely more to come. We see that, we will combine our strengths in technology deployment at scale in every basin in the world, combining this with the subsurface sequestration technology leadership we have to offer customers an all in capability from sequestration design execution to carbon capture, combining our technology with the technology of our carbon capture. We are very positive on this and we believe that, as this business will scale, as we will be in a position to add on many new innovation technology on it, this will result into margin expansion and into ability to extract a lot of value from this acquisition. Yes. This is a great question, Saurabh. We are very excited. We are very excited because we believe this is one of the leg of technology deployment that could change the game in the long-term and in the subsea infrastructure deployment. First, because it allows a lower footprint, a smaller footprint, reducing and eliminating hydraulics into the subsea and eliminate -- ultimately eliminating cost. And secondly, allowing full digital control of the subsea infrastructure. And last, obviously, having an impact onto the carbon footprint of this infrastructure. So we believe that for recovery, cost and low carbon, we believe that there is a future for our deepwater all-electric bid on the subsurface. And as you have seen, we you might have seen that we have announced earlier in the year and last year that we have made progress and being awarded several contracts on a completion subsurface all-electric solution. I will continue to lead in this domain and combine it with all-electric subsidiary or subsea infrastructure that then when combined together with the subsurface give us an opportunity to fully digitize and fully control and provide our customers and the operators the ability to optimize recovery and control and optimize the maintenance as well in this field. So that's part of the future of deepwater is electric and we're very pleased to have been awarded this as a result of our consortium actually, [Indiscernible] for other operators. So this will take place in several basins we believe, in particular in Brazil and another place and we'll be ready to deploy this for our customers. No. I think the trend has been up, and I think it has been contributing in line with our ambition for digital growth as the data exploration sales has been a success. And we foresee this to continue to grow going forward in the quarters to come. Sometime, it will be up and sometime it will be slightly down, but we foresee a growth and I think this is driven by the frontier exploration. This is driven by infrastructure led exploration in natural basins and this is driven by new generation of software digital application that can relook an existing basin and extract more value for understanding and finding new hydrocarbon and or new gas finds into the existing basins. So, we're very pleased to have a leading offering both in term of digital capability to repossess existing data sets and also to be able to enhance the vintage data sets and to be having this in the right basin and the right place and parts linked too many of these licensing rounds. You're right to say that, many licensing round expected this year, no less than actually 70 licensing rounds are being announced across many parts of the world and I think some of them have been highly successful. Deepwater has been a success for critical finds and critical hydrocarbon, both oil and gas in the last few quarters and we expect this to continue. There's increased interest into the Apollo pass, which is the last hot spot South of Brazil. You have the Namibe Basin south of Angola, North of Namibia. You have Indonesia, India. You have Bangladesh, you have many, many spots that are being discovered and being explored with fresh data sets and the opportunity to indeed boost and support our participation to this market going forward. I think we will continue to participate and maximize this, and this will be, on occasion, lumpy, but we believe this will continue to grow. I think we have been guiding earlier this year. We remain fit on this guidance that, internationally, we foresee double-digit growth when excluding Aker and Russia. North America, we have been guiding originally positive up to mid-single growth and we have been realizing this down as the North America has been clearly impacted going forward. But, we still have opportunity to grow in the second half and to improve our margin as well in this basin as we adjust our resource and get the most out of deepwater market in Gulf of Mexico as well as our participation with technology intensity in some part of the North American land market. No change international and lower growth in North America, compared to original guidance. I think you may have been reading and don't want to speak on behalf of Saudi Aramco, but I think their commitment to their program to increase gas production by 60% from 2020 is very clear. I think this touched both the conventional and unconventional gas reserve in Saudi. The most visible element of this is obviously the unconventional gas large Jafurah project. You may have seen they've also explored successfully new finds, both oil and gas, in the recent months. So, the country is set to expand in gas to complement their oil capacity, sustained capacity and slight expansion. And we are -- as I said, favorably exposed, and we have reinforced this exposure, strengthened this exposure with our recent wins, as you may have seen in the earnings press release from this morning. So, we're very pleased. But the market is not only one project. The market is not only one aspect. The market is much more diversified in Saudi and furthermore in Middle East. So, we are exposed to many aspects of the Saudi activity, both production and recovery, exploration, CCS, as well as, well construction and production equipment, both offshore and onshore. So we are very -- we have a very diversified exposure to this, and we benefit favorably to the exposure of the growth accelerated growth in Jafurah. So, we're very pleased to where we are. And we are one of the most beneficiary of the accelerated gas expansion as highlighted in our EPR highlights. So that's where we stand. Thank you. Thank you, Leah. So ladies and gentlemen, as we conclude today's call, I would like to leave you with the following takeaways. First, the growth momentum continues with many of our international [GeoUnits] reaching new cycle highs. Combined with the increased adoption of digital technologies, the stage is set for further growth and margin expansion throughout the rest of 2024 and into 2025. Second, in this environment, no company is better positioned than SLB to capture quality growth. Our differentiated operating footprint, leading technical and digital offerings and sustained commitment to operating efficiency and value creation have set us apart throughout the cycle. Moving ahead, we remain favorably positioned in the highest quality area of the market, supported by our differentiated technology deployment, integration capabilities and performance. And third, with a strong first half of the year behind us and full confidence in further international revenue growth, we are optimally positioned to continue our margin expansion journey to generate cash and to fulfill our commitment to return to shareholders both in 2024 and in 2025. This is an excellent environment for our business, and I'm confident that we will continue to deliver outstanding performance for our customers and our shareholders in the quarters ahead. With that, I will conclude this morning's call. Thank you very much for joining."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to James R. McDonald, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations & Industry Affairs. Please go ahead.\nJames McDonald: Thank you, Leah. Good morning, and welcome to the SLB first quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Today's call is being hosted from Kuala Lumpur, following our Board meeting held earlier this week. Joining us on the call are Olivier Le Peuch, Chief Executive Officer; and Stephane Biguet, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I would like to remind all participants that some of the statements we will be making today are forward-looking. These matters involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. I therefore refer you to our latest 10-K filing and other SEC filings which can be found on our website. We are under no obligation, and expressly disclaim any obligation to update, alter or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. Our comments today may also include non-GAAP financial measures. Additional details and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our first quarter press release, which is on our website. And finally, SLB and ChampionX will file materials related to the proposed transaction with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including a registration statement that will contain a proxy statement/prospectus of the parties. Investors and security holders are urged to read those materials once they are available, which can be obtained from the SEC's website and from the companies\u2019 websites. SLB, ChampionX, their directors, executive officers, and certain members of management and their employees may be considered participants in the solicitation of proxies from their shareholders in connection with the proposed transaction. This will be described further in the proxy statement/prospectus perspective when it is filed. With that, I will turn the call over to Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, James. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on the call today. During my prepared remarks, I will discuss three topics. I will begin by sharing an overview of our first quarter results; then, I will provide an update on the ongoing market dynamics and highlight areas where we anticipate opportunities for further growth; and finally, I will conclude with our outlook for the full year and the second quarter. Stephane will then provide more details on our financial results, and we will open the line for your questions. Let's begin. I'm very pleased with our strong start to 2024. Year-on-year, revenue grew 13% and EBITDA grew in the mid-teens, in line with our full year financial ambitions. Additionally, we demonstrated the differentiated value we deliver to our customers, the impact of our continued capital discipline, and execution efficiency, by expanding year-on-year adjusted EBITDA margins for the 13th consecutive quarter. Internationally, we harnessed broad-based activity growth, with 21 of our 25 international GeoUnits increasing revenue year-on-year. Even when excluding the Aker contribution, our international revenue grew by double-digits. These impressive results were led by the Middle East & Asia, which exhibited remarkable growth of 29% compared to the same period a year ago. Specifically in the Middle East and North Africa, year-on-year growth was supported by continued investments in long-cycle developments and capacity expansion projects, in both oil and gas, across Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, Libya, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. And in Asia, we saw strong activity across the region led by offshore, notably in China, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and India. Meanwhile, in North America, activity remains soft due to weaker gas prices, sustained capital discipline, and the effects of ongoing market consolidation. The slower activity contributed to revenue in the region declining by 6% year-on-year. Next, I will comment on the Divisions\u2019 performance. I was very proud to see the power of the core divisions continue to drive our performance this quarter. In particular, you may have seen the remarkable growth in Production Systems, supported by our OneSubsea joint venture, and in Reservoir Performance, led by increased stimulation, evaluation, and intervention services. Well Construction also delivered resilient growth. I was also pleased to see our core margins visibly expand year-on-year, and I trust that this will continue as we remain focused on efficiency and value creation for our customers. Turning to Digital & Integration. I continue to follow our performance very closely. Although we experienced the typical pattern of seasonally slower sales to start the year, digital still grew in the double-digits year-on-year during the first quarter and we expect a visible uptick of digital sales throughout the rest of the year. This will be supported by increased customer adoption and a baseload of ongoing projects, as you can see from the quarterly highlights included in our press release this morning. For the full year, we maintain our ambition to grow our digital revenue in the high-teens. Overall, I am very pleased with this strong start to 2024. We will remain focused on the quality of our revenue, capital discipline, and execution efficiency to generate strong cash flows and shareholder returns throughout the year. I want to thank the entire SLB team for delivering this first quarter performance. They continue to operate at a benchmark level for the industry, and I feel privileged to work with such a dedicated and talented team. Next, let me shift into the ongoing market dynamics and how these are creating opportunities for our business. We are in the midst of a unique oil and gas cycle, characterized by strong market fundamentals, growing demand, and an even deeper focus on energy security. As described on several occasions, this cycle continue to display breadth, resilience, and longevity, this is very much the case in the Asia region where we are hosting this call today. In this context, there are certain priorities that are increasingly critical to our customers: project life-cycle reduction, particularly in exploration & appraisal to accelerate time to first gas or first oil; capital efficiency in the development phase to set new benchmarks in every basin; step change in production and recovery for producing assets and for unconventional resources; and finally, adoption of Digital & Al capabilities to transform operations and use of technology to abate emissions. Against this backdrop, we continue to innovate with our customers, through the combination of integration, fit-for-basin technologies, and digital, focusing on unlocking value by delivering lower-cost and lower-carbon barrels. In our Core oil and gas business, we are benefiting from these trends with our exposure to the fastest growing and most resilient markets. This cycle continues to be defined by broad growth across the international basins, and there is nowhere this is more evident than in the Middle East and global offshore markets. In the Middle East, countries are investing to increase both oil and gas supplies through the end of the decade. The long-cycle nature of the investments provides further confidence in the durability of the cycle, and we look forward to continue working with our customers to deliver on these targets. And offshore, many of the FIDs from the past few years have commenced, leading to broad-based activity across Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Europe. SLB has a strong foothold in each of these offshore regions, benefiting from our deep customer relationships, operational performance, and fit-for-basin solutions. Through our OneSubsea joint venture, we offer an unmatched pore-to-process offering throughout the full lifecycle of offshore assets, and we continue to deliver on our substantial offshore backlog. Now, looking at the priorities for producing assets today and tomorrow, we recognize the need to increase our exposure to the Production and Recovery market, including the more resilient OpEx spend, as operators work to offset natural decline, extend performance, and maximize the value of their assets. Our acquisition of ChampionX will further evolve our portfolio to capture this opportunity with the addition of a leading production chemicals business and well-established artificial lift (ph) portfolio with significant benefits to our customers in every producing basin in the world. This will be particularly visible in the offshore environment, which requires a higher intensity of production chemicals for flow assurance, reinforcing the long-cycle value of our offshore strategy. Another notable trend in the market is the enhanced focus on emissions reduction and low-carbon energy. Our early investments in this space are beginning to deliver promising results, both in the Core through our Transition Technologies, and in our New Energy portfolio, notably in Carbon Capture and Sequestration. CCS is one of the fastest-growing and most-immediate opportunities to reduce carbon emissions, and we are leveraging our domain expertise and deep knowledge of the subsurface to respond to an increased demand in our storage solutions. At the same time, we are also expanding to address opportunities throughout the CCS value chain. As you saw in our announcement a few weeks ago, we have entered into an agreement to combine our carbon capture business with Aker Carbon Capture and will own 80% of the combined entity. This is an exciting opportunity to bring together our complementary technology portfolios, leading process design expertise, and an established project delivery platform to innovate and deliver carbon capture technology solutions at an industrial scale. Looking across our broad portfolio, it is clear that our three engines of growth, each with differentiated technologies and exciting project pipelines, are positioning us for continued performance across all time horizons. Supported by our strong international portfolio and our unique technology driven approach to North America, we are truly making this investment cycle better for longer. Finally, I will conclude with our outlook for the full year and the second quarter. Based on the commentary I have just shared, the ongoing characteristics of the cycle, and our strong first quarter results, we remain confident in our full year financial guidance, with strength in international activity offsetting slower growth in North America. In particular, we anticipate the activity momentum in the international markets to continue, driven by increasing global demand and an even deeper focus on energy security. The relevance of oil and gas in the energy mix continues to support further investments in capacity expansion, particularly in the Middle East and in long-cycle projects across the global offshore markets, fully aligned with our international revenue ambitions. Additionally, we expect to realize further growth in the strengthening production and recovery market as operators work to maximize the efficiency and longevity of their producing assets. Altogether, this continues to present a very strong outlook for our business during 2024 and beyond. Specific to the second quarter, we expect sequential revenue growth internationally in the mid-single digits and North America in the low-single digits. We also expect to expand adjusted EBITDA margins by 75 bps to100 bps. By Division, we expect sequential growth to be led by Digital & Integration, followed by Reservoir Performance, Production Systems, and Well Construction, all of which are rebounding from the conclusion of winter seasonality. I will now turn the call over to Stephane.\nStephane Biguet: Thank you, Olivier. Good morning, ladies, and gentlemen. First quarter earnings per share excluding charges and credits was $0.75. This represents an increase of $0.12 when compared to the first quarter of last year. In addition, during the first quarter, we recorded $0.01 of merger and integration charges associated with our 2023 acquisition of the Aker subsea business. Overall, our first quarter revenue of $8.7 billion increased 12.6% year-on-year. Excluding the impact of the Aker subsea acquisition, revenue increased 6.5% when compared to the same quarter last year. International revenue was up 18% year-on-year, and more than 10% when excluding the contribution from Aker, driven in particular by year-on-year growth of 29% in the Middle East & Asia. North America revenue decreased 6% year-on-year, primarily due to lower rig count in U.S. land and the effect of lower gas pricing which impacted our APS project in Canada. Company-wide adjusted EBITDA margin for the first quarter was 23.6%, up 51 basis points year-on-year. In absolute dollars, adjusted EBITDA increased 15% year-on-year. This is in line with our guidance for adjusted EBITDA to grow in the mid-teens for the full year of 2024. Our pre-tax segment operating margin increased 95 basis points driven by strong incremental margins internationally. Let me now go through the first quarter results for each division. First quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $953 million increased 7% year-on-year as Digital revenue experienced double-digit growth while APS revenue was flat. Margins declined 300 basis points year-on-year to 26.6% due to the effects of higher APS amortization expense and lower commodity prices on our APS project in Canada. Margins for the Digital & Integration Division are expected to improve in Q2 and throughout the rest of the year, as digital sales will increase sequentially, in line with the usual seasonal trend. Reservoir Performance revenue of $1.7 billion increased 15% year-on-year due to strong stimulation activity, particularly in Middle East & Asia and offshore. Margins expanded 356 basis points as compared to the first quarter of last year to 19.7% driven by higher activity and improved pricing. Well Construction revenue of $3.4 billion increased 3% year-on-year as International growth of 9% was largely offset by lower revenue in North America. Margins of 20.5% were essentially flat year-on-year. Finally, Production Systems revenue of $2.8 billion increased 28% year-on-year. Excluding the effects of the acquired Aker subsea business, Production Systems revenue grew 6% driven by strong international sales. Margins of 14.2% expanded 490 basis points year-on-year driven by a favorable activity mix, strong execution, and pricing improvements. Now turning to our liquidity. During the quarter, we generated $327 million of cash flow from operations. Free cash flow of negative $222 million was slightly better than the same period last year. These cash flows reflect the seasonal effects of the payout of our annual employee incentives and lower cash collections following very strong receivable performance in the fourth quarter of last year. Consistent with our historical trend, free cash flow is expected to be higher in the second quarter and to continue to increase in the third and fourth quarters. Capital investments, inclusive of CapEx and investments in APS projects and exploration data were $549 million in the first quarter. For the full year, we are still expecting capital investments to be approximately $2.6 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased 5.4 million shares for a total purchase price of $270 million. As we disclosed a couple of weeks ago, we have raised our 2024 target for total returns of capital to shareholders from $2.5 billion to $3 billion. This $3 billion will be evenly split between dividends and share repurchases. Lastly, we plan on filing our S-4 registration statement relating to the ChampionX acquisition in the next couple of weeks. The transaction will require the approval of ChampionX shareholders. During the period after ChampionX mails its proxy for the merger until its shareholder vote, we are required to suspend our share buyback program. While this will not impact our total share repurchases for the year of approximately $1.5 billion, it will potentially result in our buybacks being more heavily weighted towards the second half of the year. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Stephane. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe, we are opening the floor for your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from James West with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nJames West: Hey. Good morning, Olivier and Stephane.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Good morning\nStephane Biguet: Good morning.\nJames West: So Olivier, I know you alluded to it earlier, and you and I have had conversations about the cycle recently as well. But how are you thinking about in the last six, eight weeks or so as we've seen just increased amounts of contracts and rig awards, and subsea equipment awards. How are you thinking about where we are in this cycle today and the duration of the cycle? Because it seems to me, we're -- right now, it's a Middle East, Asia and offshore story, but certainly going to broaden out to more regions as well. So I'm curious to kind of get your big picture high-level thoughts.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, James. So from our perspective, I think, first and foremost, I think the cycle attributes that we have described earlier, the breadth, the resilience, the durability or the longevity of the cycle are fully in place and are driven by a combination of strong fundamental energy demand, oil and gas demand, if anything is trending upwards from the revision. Energy security is still on top of the agenda. There is no other place than Asia to realize this on the ground. And as such, I think the base of (ph) activity is being supported by very critical flow of investment, both as you said, in capacity expansion, which is already committed. But also, I think in short-cycle and long-cycle offshore, deepwater and shallow. And I think I was here in Asia, and it was remarkable to see the breadth, the diversity of the opportunity, the number of countries, offshore, onshore, the new exploration appraisal cycle, the new entrants that are coming in Southeast Asia, they were not before to invest because they are looking for securing gas supply, and they are looking to participate to maintain oil production. So I believe that if you combine this with what is happening in North America, which is North America operating within a threshold and not necessarily with significant anticipation of supply growth in that market in short term. This is only accentuating the characteristics of the cycle in international. And it can -- if I can reflect from the last two or three months of a lot of customer engagements, the sentiment is trending more positively than it was maybe six or 12 months ago. Hence, customer engaging to secure capacity on long projects such as deepwater and subsea, and they are looking for partnership collaboration to make sure that we help them into securing the best capital efficiency, as I highlighted, look for integration to accelerate the product cycle to get faster to first oil, first gas. So if anything, I think I see more, stronger pipeline of projects that will help us -- help this cycle to prolong beyond what we could have anticipated a year ago.\nJames West: Right. Got it. Okay. Makes a lot of sense. And then maybe just as a follow-up on the digital side and the rollout of the Delfi platform. How do you feel about the progress that's happening there, the adoption by customers? I know you've got a good number of customers so far, but still the penetration is probably not nearly where it will be in three to five years, but it's a powerful tool and so how do you see adoption trending from here?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think the adoption continues to trend favorably. I think you'll continue to see as we deliver quarter-after-quarter both sorts of announcements in digital operation in cloud adoption for geoscience workflow or in data and AI, as you have seen the diversity of what we announced this quarter. I do expect the same next quarter and the following quarter because we believe that customers are realizing that they need to unlock efficiency and they need to accelerate the cycle, and they need to extract lower carbon solutions for their assets. So this is pulling. So we are still -- and we have renewed our ambition and targets to reach or exceed high teens for digital growth this year. And we started the year, I would say, considering the seasonal low - in the teens -- low teens growth year-on-year, double-digits, that was fully aligned with what we could have anticipated and it will continue. So I see quarter-after-quarter expansion of digital adoption. And I see more and more contribution from digital operations, be it drilling automation with production operation solutions, and you will see that in the coming quarter and the upcoming transaction with ChampionX will only strengthen this production operation offering as it will complement and give us another platform to expand our digital adoption. So I remain very constructive, and I believe that it is a long trend of digital adoption that will continue throughout the rest of the decade.\nJames West: Got it. Perfect. Thanks, Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, James.\nOperator: Next, we move on to David Anderson with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nDavid Anderson: Thank you. Good morning, Olivier and Stephane.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Good morning, David.\nStephane Biguet: Good morning.\nDavid Anderson: So just a question on kind of the timing of the ChampionX deal and sort of, as it relates to where we are in the cycle. So these are all product lines that are targeting the production side of the well life cycle, primary drivers can be OpEx spending, particularly with deepwater development ramping up in the coming years. Conversely, the timing of acquiring a later cycle company might suggest that you're positioned for upstream spending to be structurally slow in the coming years. So could you just help us understand a little bit the dynamics as sort of the OpEx cycle and the CapEx cycle? I totally appreciate the duration of it, but I guess I'm sort of thinking about the sort of the cadence of the different cycles. Can you just help us understand kind of how the timing of that works out and maybe you just see the OpEx cycle expanding higher, but the two dynamics, I think, are causing a little bit of questioning in the market, I guess, today.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yeah. No, it's a fair question. And I think first and foremost, stepping back in time. I think we have been -- as we prepared our core strategy a few years back, we identified that production recovery in particular production chemicals, reservoir chemicals, and lift solutions will be a domain where we need to invest in technology, and we need to explore opportunity to accelerate our market participation because we believe two things: we believe first, that this market will benefit from further innovation, from further integration, from further disruption, and hence create through OpEx, the efficiency gains into production operations, into recovery. And we believe that the market is discovering to some extent has discovered, but has an opportunity to exploit more of these production chemicals, more of this optimized full life lift solution and combined with digital, so we believe that all in all, this market is not only an OpEx versus CapEx. This market is responding to increased demand, and increased opportunity we see in the market that has been there growing, and for which we are willing to respond and the customer feedback and engagement we had realizing the potential of what we can put together from technology from workflow integration, from automation and from optimization from the main reservoir knowledge to process equipment will clearly create a new leg into the technology deployment and into the efficiency of producing assets. So -- and I will not try to oppose OpEx/CapEx. I will just say that the production recovery is becoming critical- it has been for the last few quarters - has increasingly become part of the priority of our customers. Now we believe as well that this market has further resilience because the market, every liquid produced in the world, more or less demands an amount of production chemicals to assure its resilience in production. And at the same time, we believe that as the long term, most of the assets will see a higher water cuts, and some of the assets will see more complex reservoir fluids coming up to the process facility. There will be an increasing need to add in more sophisticated and more technical production chemicals to the flow. So all in all, an opportunity today and a resilient outlook for tomorrow.\nDavid Anderson: So it's not so much, you see, I've seen CapEx slowing. It is more that you see OpEx side increasing and more technology increasing. That sounds...\nOlivier Le Peuch: Exactly. I see what we see and in the engagement with customers, we see that in their quest for production recovery opportunity, we see that a combination of production chemicals, digital capability including optimizing some production lift solutions and overall intervention is in dire need for modernizing, innovation, and automation. And we believe that the addition of this to our portfolio, the significant talent and capability we are getting through the addition of ChampionX will help us fast-track this new path of production recovery market expansion. That would be a combination of OpEx and CapEx, and OpEx will only supplement and add opportunity for growth and it is not at all relating to where we are in the cycle for CapEx.\nDavid Anderson: Understood. And then so just as a follow-up on the ChampionX deal. I was surprised to see you announced $400 million in synergies for a company that was as well run as ChampionX is. Can you help us break that down a little bit more? Like, where do you see the greatest opportunity on the cost side? And also, if you could expand the revenue synergy side. To be honest, we hear about revenue synergies all the time but ultimately don't materialize. So what's different here in ChampionX, where you have more confidence in the revenue synergy side?\nStephane Biguet: So Dave, yes, thanks for the question. So again, yes, $400 million of annual synergies which we think we can achieve in the first three years. And as we said, 70% to 80% achieved in the second year, which makes the transaction accretive to earnings per share in year two. So now we have the full integration team in place, refining estimates going through all the buckets of synergies. So I\u2019m not going to give you definitive numbers, but as a rough split, most of the synergies, most of the $400 million synergies, let\u2019s say, about 75% of it is related to costs and 25% related to initial revenue synergies, so of the 75% cost synergies, again, an approximate 75%, you can say that roughly half of that is on our own SLB spend. We mentioned earlier, we spent a lot of chemicals, for example, for overall operations. And with the manufacturing and internalization of spend we can do with ChampionX, we think we can have great savings there. And the over half or so of the cost synergies would be G&A and other operating cost savings if that helps.\nDavid Anderson: Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nStephane Biguet: Thank you.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Dave.\nOperator: Next, we move on to Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nArun Jayaram: Good morning. Olivier, I wanted to get your perspective on the spending picture in Saudi Arabia and the potential impacts from SLB given the decision to maintain their maximum spare capacity at 12 million barrels, but obviously, a shift to higher levels of gas development. And I just wondered also if you could maybe address just the recent decision to suspend some shallow water drilling in the country.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yeah. Thank you, Arun. I think let me first maybe for simplicity and for aligning our views, maybe let me unpack first and give some additional color on this rig suspension. And I think these are public data, and I think a total of 20 to 22 rigs are being suspended to divest for consolidation. But this is in the context of this both Safaniya and Manifa projects, oil incremental project expansion program, that has been suspended. Both of these assets were having combined slightly above 20 jackups operating in these two assets at the end of last year. The anticipation of the additional rigs necessary for the expansion, we expect customers will add (corrected by company after the call) another dozen rigs. When you make the math at the end of this year, both of these assets will host slightly above 10 to a dozen rigs or a net 10 rigs less than the rig count at the (corrected by company after the call) end of last year. So that's first, what is happening on offshore. You contrast this with the gas market and a decision that was almost coincidental with the MSC decision, to increase the gas capacity towards 2030 by 60% compared to 2021. This is actually resulting in the total rig activity increase and net rig addition between now and the end of the year 2025 (added by company after the call) of a total approximately 35-40 (corrected by company after the call) rigs across the entire unconventional and conventional, both workover rigs, coiled tubing drilling units, and drilling rigs for the unconventional Jafurah and for the conventional gas. So this switch from offshore to onshore, the switch from oil to gas is actually the execution of strategy of Saudi Aramco, I believe. And it happened that we have market exposure that is long on land, very long on land and it's balanced and actually long on gas. So as a consequence for us, while this is an activity that has changed and a mix that wasn't anticipated six months ago, this will not have a natural impact on our ambition for growth for Saudi, this will not change our guidance for Middle East sustained growth. And this will continue to support our ambition to grow international and hence, the full guidance directed this morning.\nArun Jayaram: Great. That's helpful. And just my follow-up, Olivier, could you just characterize the rest of the spending picture in the GCC and the Middle East outside of Saudi?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yeah. I think that's a very good point. Actually, it's very broad growth and activity uptick in almost all the country with possible exception of Egypt these days, considering the cash and the valuation situation. But almost every other country is having a very significant growth and I have been citing a few countries this morning, and I could not stop listing all of them. And it includes Qatar that is starting to now remobilize for addition of the West North field. Obviously, Kuwait, as we commented earlier that is coming now very well structured to execute their capacity expansion, UAE on both gas and oil. Oman is very steady. Iraq, as you have seen, we have had some nice contracts also in that region. So we are very comfortable about the breadth, the diversity of the activity growth, rig activity growth, in the region. And actually, a couple of rigs or more could actually be redirected from the offshore Saudi contract to supplement and to help accelerate some activity in the region, while some others are already being retained to some extent for future activity here in the Southeast Asia. So I believe that the Middle East, as we said earlier, last year broke and had a total market spend that was record high. I think this record is just extending this year and with a very good breadth of oil and gas onshore and offshore activity despite a slight change of mix in Saudi.\nArun Jayaram: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we move on to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNeil Mehta: Yeah. Thank you for all the strategic comments. I had a couple of more financial questions. The first, just the second quarter commentary, if I look at Q1 EPS was $0.75, and I think The Street's got moving to $0.84 in the second quarter. So just would love your perspective on how we should think about the 2Q versus 1Q build as you have pretty good visibility at this point into the second quarter?\nStephane Biguet: So Neil, as we have mentioned Q2, we always see the reversal of seasonality, if you want, and very strong margin expansion. So we just guided to 75 to 100 basis points of incremental EBITDA margin in terms of basis points. And the rest is below the EBITDA, you can very well assume to go down to EPS, but non-operating expenses and just about all the rest is about the same as in the first quarter, if that helps.\nNeil Mehta: That helps, falls in pretty well with The Street. I guess the follow-up is just on EBITDA margins. It did come in a little bit softer than maybe where The Street was on digital and integration, to a smaller extent, on Well Construction. Just love your perspective as we work our way through the year, how we should be thinking about EBITDA margins and your conviction on the recovery there? Thank you.\nStephane Biguet: So as Olivier mentioned, it has been 13 consecutive quarters that we increased EBITDA margin year-on-year. So it was the case in the first quarter as well, and it will be the case in each and every single of the remaining quarters of the year. So this year-on-year growth of EBITDA and EBITDA expansion is with us for the year. Now you mentioned the D&I margins. As you know, we are typically the lowest in the first quarter of the year, this is mostly the seasonally lower digital sales. This year, it was made worse by a lower APS revenue due to two kind of related effects, actually. The lower gas pricing in our Palliser, Canada assets and higher amortization expense per unit of production. So this resulted in a year-on-year drop in the total digital and integration margin, but this is entirely due to APS, the digital margins are intact. And as the rest of the year unfolds, as Olivier mentioned, digital sales will increase quarter-after-quarter and this will be at high incremental margins for digital considering that most of the costs are fixed. So we clearly continue to shoot for overall D&I margins above 30% on a full year basis.\nNeil Mehta: Thank you so much.\nStephane Biguet: Thank you.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you, Neil.\nOperator: Our next question is from Scott Gruber with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nScott Gruber: Yes. Hello. I wanted to just circle back on the Saudi comments because a few investors have asked for some clarification. Olivier, did you mention that the rig growth was the net 60, 60, even with the losses of 20 jackups?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yeah. I think that I'm contrasting, I think, some offset cases, so there will be increase. There was a plan that has not changed for Saudi to accelerate the gas expansion program, what has accelerated, what has improved, is the pace of this expansion program, driven by the raise of 50% to 60% target by 2030. And as a consequence of that, the whole year that was based on previous plans that now boosted by this accelerated expansion program will result into total rigs year-on-year that will, from beginning of the year to the end, add 35-40 (corrected by company after the call) rigs in total to the gas market, all onshore. So that's the reality of the market. Some of it in unconventional, up to 10 to 15 rigs in unconventional, some of it in the gas conventional, some of it in intervention and workover, so that's a total activity that gas is a strong market for Saudi, is becoming a significant market going forward. So that's where we expect activity to continue to grow going forward. And we are essentially favorably exposed to this activity set as we have an exposure that goes above, we are long on gas as we explained. And hence, we benefit from technology that we have deployed in Saudi that is fit for the Jafurah project, technology such as coiled tubing, underbalanced coiled tubing drilling solution, that is being used on Gabon gas and the technology that we use across for conventional gas is either integrated or discrete contracts. So that's the benefit we see, and that's the total rig that we see going forward.\nScott Gruber: Thanks. It's encouraging, thanks for clarifying that. And then turning back to well construction margins. Should we be expecting those to come in about flat for the year. I know they'll improve seasonally and are always strong in the second half. Should we be thinking about kind of flat year-on-year and just thinking about the mix in that business, historically, with greater offshore activity and weaker U.S. onshore activity, I would just expect those margins to be grinding higher. So maybe if you could comment on what's kind of keeping those flat year-on-year? Maybe the mix just isn't that impactful any more with the new sales strategy in the U.S., but just some color on the year-over-year margins in Well Construction would be great.\nStephane Biguet: So look, we were flat indeed in Q1 year-on-year. But for the full year, you should actually see margin expansion in Well Construction, what the headwind we have a bit is the lower activity in North America, so that kind of masks the margin expansion internationally, but as we go through the year, you will see year-on-year growth in Well Construction. You have timing of certain stuff and adjustments on a quarterly basis. But on a year-on-year basis, you will clearly see margin expansion coming from international.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Maybe for clarity of the split on the net addition in the gas market in Saudi. The net addition due to the expansion acceleration is about 20 rigs.\nScott Gruber: Okay. Great. Thanks. [Multiple Speakers]\nOlivier Le Peuch: A bit more than half of that in a little bit more than half of that in unconventional and the rest in the conventional. So that\u2019s the resulting effect of this acceleration of gas expansion into Saudi. Hence, the shift indeed from offshore to onshore and from oil to gas characterized by this accelerated expansion translating to 20 rigs and the reduction of the net offshore from end of year last year to the end of the year this year that is above 10%, plus the mix changing for clients.\nScott Gruber: Okay. Got it. I appreciate that. Thank you.\nStephane Biguet: Thank you.\nOperator: Next, we go to Kurt Hallead with Benchmark. Please go ahead.\nKurt Hallead: Hey. Hey, everybody. Thank you for sliding me in here. I appreciate that. So given the fact that you are currently in Kuala Lumpur and Asia seems to be one of your growth vehicles and something that really hasn't gotten a lot of airtime. Just kind of curious as to what you see is driving that growth and what regions within Asia you is standing out to you?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Great question. I think, indeed, we had a reason to come here. And the reason why, first, the team has delivered and have been delivering a resilient growth and resilient margin expansion over the last two years since the rebound from the COVID time. And I think we have been observing, supporting the team, but I think spending two weeks in a region, I think, is clearly giving us a little bit more spotlight on to the strength of the region. I think, first and foremost, I have to say, this region is characterized by the critical resources they are putting to support security of supply, particularly gas, and investment they are going to, I would say, to support and stabilize oil production and prevent further decline. So stabilizing oil production and accelerating gas is certainly the feeling that has come on to the entire region. And I think it's further accentuated by energy security and is translating into a new wave of investments. It was very telling to see that in Indonesia, in Malaysia, in South -- in offshore China, in Bangladesh, in India. We are seeing new round of exploration appraisal that have not been seen with new entrants into this market that were not there, certainly a few years back. And I think this is creating a new set of opportunity, both offshore primarily and some of them in deepwater assets, and I think that will create further opportunity for Subsea. And at the same time, as I said, and I stress, there is also a focus independently onto supporting and preventing production decline for oil. And this is visible across all assets, both onshore and offshore, and hence, intervention recovery technology is being pulled to add investment. So you combine this wave of new investment for accelerating gas from exploration to development projects with this intervention recovery-focused production on the existing declining assets that exist here in all markets across the region, and we get the recipe for a significant investment and a steady investment in every country from Indonesia to Malaysia, to Thailand, China offshore and onshore, India, Bangladesh, as I said, a new country. And I think this is very interesting and very exciting for the team, and we are responding to this by deploying assets to bring the resources and creating fit technology for the market to help us grow and continue to succeed in this region.\nKurt Hallead: That's great. That's great color. I appreciate that. So maybe a follow-up here as you kind of referenced significant opportunities to tap into the production spending profile, your customer base and hence, the dynamic related to the ChampionX acquisition. When you look at the production chemicals piece of the business, ChampionX is a clear leader there. And just kind of curious as to, is there, for a lack of a better phrase, like some secret recipes and production chemicals that you guys are bringing to the table that could potentially enhance margins and substantially boost the revenue growth rate or boost the ChampionX position?\nOlivier Le Peuch: I think there are multiple aspects to this, okay? First and foremost, I think we have been operating also in production chemicals, albeit at a smaller scale in the international market. We are actually having quite a portfolio in reservoir chemicals that are helping us extract recovery and optimize our intervention and stimulation program also in international markets. And we believe that combining this will help us open and compare and optimize fit for reservoir solutions, fit for process facility solution. And I think we both are coming from different positional strengths. We have a process portfolio, equipment process portfolio, both onshore and onshore. We have reservoir chemicals and subsurface domain expertise and fluid expertise and they have obviously fluids and understanding of the reservoir, of the production chemistry portfolio. So I think combining both, I think, is, in our opinion, a unique opportunity and the feedback from customers is indicating that they see a lot of potential in this combination. We'll obviously try to add and extend this to a full integrated production solution, including digital including lift solutions, including intervention and including process equipment optimization that we deliver on FPSO and other places. So the place where this will have further effect, in my opinion, is an offshore environment. And also, we will compare and complement each other on trying to find low carbon and solutions that help also created further differentiated portfolio of sustainable production chemical portfolio for the market. So we have quite an upside in technology, in addition to having an upside on market expansion to use our international footprint to complement the strength of ChampionX production chemical in North America.\nKurt Hallead: Thanks, Olivier. Appreciate it.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Welcome. Thank you.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Luke Lemoine with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nLuke Lemoine: Hey, good evening. Olivier, on carbon capture, understand what SLB is doing and what Aker is doing. But can you help frame how you see this business developing along with how the combinations greater than the two stand-alone entities?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yeah. Great question. First and foremost, I think we see CCS is certainly the most obvious and the most attractive market, total addressable markets adjacent to our space where we can contribute to decarbonization of the industrial space. So we believe we are first at market position and a lot of play into the sequestration through our technology, to our digital and solution to deliver not only site selection, but also site characterization and development of sites for carbon sequestration. So that's -- and by doing this, we have significant access to a large number of customers within oil and gas through that, and beyond oil and gas through the operator, the emitters, that are willing to develop. So we have this as a starting point that give us market access across many of the FIDs and many of the projects, and we quoted more than 30 projects, we are always part of at any point in time. And I think we have had quite a lot of experience there. So we also have invested into capture technology that we have done, such as RTI for non-aqueous solvent, which are trying -- where we are trying to disrupt the intervention, we have to disrupt the economics of capture for low stream -- local concentration stream of CO2 in hard-to-abate sector. But what Aker Carbon Capture brings into this is a commercial solution platform or recommercialize that will serve us as a base for expansion for deployment of our capture technology. And also we'll build on the initial success they have had to deploy this platform to some European markets and use our footprint where we see the market evolving fast in North America, Middle East and in Asia and using this platform and being the go-to-market for this carbon capture solution that they are offering, but supplementing it with our innovation that we are investing in and using this as a platform to deploy innovation. So combining sequestration and capture to offer this combined opportunity for the customers as technology solution and using the platform of the commercial carbon capture, Aker Carbon Capture, that exists today, is commercial, and using it as a platform to deploy and add and supplement this with new disruptive technology. That's the purpose, and that's the intention we have, that's the ambition we have in this market.\nLuke Lemoine: Okay. And then maybe on North America, it's a smaller piece of your business, but can you talk about how you see it developing over the course of the year past 2Q?\nOlivier Le Peuch: Yeah. I think we have been originally guiding and we are keeping our guidance that we believe that on a full year basis, it will be more muted than we had anticipated at the beginning of the year, considering the softness of the market at the start of the year, the persistent low gas price, the capital discipline and also the consolidation in the market. And we expect, going forward, we guided low-single digit growth sequentially. We anticipate at the end of the year to still outperform the market that will see a year-on-year decline on the activity by posting muted, but positive growth. But the shortfall that we may have, considering this offset will be fully offset by international growth as we commented where we see resilience, and we see further growth potential in many markets. So hence, we have reiterated our full year guidance.\nLuke Lemoine: Okay. Great. Thanks, Olivier.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll turn the conference back to Olivier Le Peuch for closing comments.\nOlivier Le Peuch: Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, to conclude today's call, I would like to leave you with the following take-aways: first, the global energy landscape remains very compelling for our business. Demand for energy is accelerating, and this is resulting in strong activity dynamics that are closely aligned with our three engines of growth. We will continue to innovate with customers across our Core, Digital, and New Energy to meet this demand in the years to come. Second, SLB remains optimally positioned to harness the ongoing oil and gas cycle for further growth. We operate in the most resilient and fastest-growing markets internationally, and we have a unique portfolio of technologies and services that differentiate us in North America. Together, our unmatched footprint and offerings will continue to set us apart and drive our outperformance globally. And third, after a strong start to 2024 and with clear visibility into the year ahead, we look forward to achieving our full year financial ambitions and commitments to shareholders return. This is an exciting time in the industry, and I am fully confident in our strategy for the future. I couldn't hope for a better backdrop to continue delivering for our customers and shareholders. With that, we will conclude this morning's call. Thank you all for joining.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Stephane Biguet",
            "content": "Thank you, Olivier. Good morning, ladies, and gentlemen. First quarter earnings per share excluding charges and credits was $0.75. This represents an increase of $0.12 when compared to the first quarter of last year. In addition, during the first quarter, we recorded $0.01 of merger and integration charges associated with our 2023 acquisition of the Aker subsea business. Overall, our first quarter revenue of $8.7 billion increased 12.6% year-on-year. Excluding the impact of the Aker subsea acquisition, revenue increased 6.5% when compared to the same quarter last year. International revenue was up 18% year-on-year, and more than 10% when excluding the contribution from Aker, driven in particular by year-on-year growth of 29% in the Middle East & Asia. North America revenue decreased 6% year-on-year, primarily due to lower rig count in U.S. land and the effect of lower gas pricing which impacted our APS project in Canada. Company-wide adjusted EBITDA margin for the first quarter was 23.6%, up 51 basis points year-on-year. In absolute dollars, adjusted EBITDA increased 15% year-on-year. This is in line with our guidance for adjusted EBITDA to grow in the mid-teens for the full year of 2024. Our pre-tax segment operating margin increased 95 basis points driven by strong incremental margins internationally. Let me now go through the first quarter results for each division. First quarter Digital & Integration revenue of $953 million increased 7% year-on-year as Digital revenue experienced double-digit growth while APS revenue was flat. Margins declined 300 basis points year-on-year to 26.6% due to the effects of higher APS amortization expense and lower commodity prices on our APS project in Canada. Margins for the Digital & Integration Division are expected to improve in Q2 and throughout the rest of the year, as digital sales will increase sequentially, in line with the usual seasonal trend. Reservoir Performance revenue of $1.7 billion increased 15% year-on-year due to strong stimulation activity, particularly in Middle East & Asia and offshore. Margins expanded 356 basis points as compared to the first quarter of last year to 19.7% driven by higher activity and improved pricing. Well Construction revenue of $3.4 billion increased 3% year-on-year as International growth of 9% was largely offset by lower revenue in North America. Margins of 20.5% were essentially flat year-on-year. Finally, Production Systems revenue of $2.8 billion increased 28% year-on-year. Excluding the effects of the acquired Aker subsea business, Production Systems revenue grew 6% driven by strong international sales. Margins of 14.2% expanded 490 basis points year-on-year driven by a favorable activity mix, strong execution, and pricing improvements. Now turning to our liquidity. During the quarter, we generated $327 million of cash flow from operations. Free cash flow of negative $222 million was slightly better than the same period last year. These cash flows reflect the seasonal effects of the payout of our annual employee incentives and lower cash collections following very strong receivable performance in the fourth quarter of last year. Consistent with our historical trend, free cash flow is expected to be higher in the second quarter and to continue to increase in the third and fourth quarters. Capital investments, inclusive of CapEx and investments in APS projects and exploration data were $549 million in the first quarter. For the full year, we are still expecting capital investments to be approximately $2.6 billion. During the quarter, we repurchased 5.4 million shares for a total purchase price of $270 million. As we disclosed a couple of weeks ago, we have raised our 2024 target for total returns of capital to shareholders from $2.5 billion to $3 billion. This $3 billion will be evenly split between dividends and share repurchases. Lastly, we plan on filing our S-4 registration statement relating to the ChampionX acquisition in the next couple of weeks. The transaction will require the approval of ChampionX shareholders. During the period after ChampionX mails its proxy for the merger until its shareholder vote, we are required to suspend our share buyback program. While this will not impact our total share repurchases for the year of approximately $1.5 billion, it will potentially result in our buybacks being more heavily weighted towards the second half of the year. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier. Good morning. Good morning. So Dave, yes, thanks for the question. So again, yes, $400 million of annual synergies which we think we can achieve in the first three years. And as we said, 70% to 80% achieved in the second year, which makes the transaction accretive to earnings per share in year two. So now we have the full integration team in place, refining estimates going through all the buckets of synergies. So I'm not going to give you definitive numbers, but as a rough split, most of the synergies, most of the $400 million synergies, let's say, about 75% of it is related to costs and 25% related to initial revenue synergies, so of the 75% cost synergies, again, an approximate 75%, you can say that roughly half of that is on our own SLB spend. We mentioned earlier, we spent a lot of chemicals, for example, for overall operations. And with the manufacturing and internalization of spend we can do with ChampionX, we think we can have great savings there. And the over half or so of the cost synergies would be G&A and other operating cost savings if that helps. Thank you. So Neil, as we have mentioned Q2, we always see the reversal of seasonality, if you want, and very strong margin expansion. So we just guided to 75 to 100 basis points of incremental EBITDA margin in terms of basis points. And the rest is below the EBITDA, you can very well assume to go down to EPS, but non-operating expenses and just about all the rest is about the same as in the first quarter, if that helps. So as Olivier mentioned, it has been 13 consecutive quarters that we increased EBITDA margin year-on-year. So it was the case in the first quarter as well, and it will be the case in each and every single of the remaining quarters of the year. So this year-on-year growth of EBITDA and EBITDA expansion is with us for the year. Now you mentioned the D&I margins. As you know, we are typically the lowest in the first quarter of the year, this is mostly the seasonally lower digital sales. This year, it was made worse by a lower APS revenue due to two kind of related effects, actually. The lower gas pricing in our Palliser, Canada assets and higher amortization expense per unit of production. So this resulted in a year-on-year drop in the total digital and integration margin, but this is entirely due to APS, the digital margins are intact. And as the rest of the year unfolds, as Olivier mentioned, digital sales will increase quarter-after-quarter and this will be at high incremental margins for digital considering that most of the costs are fixed. So we clearly continue to shoot for overall D&I margins above 30% on a full year basis. Thank you. So look, we were flat indeed in Q1 year-on-year. But for the full year, you should actually see margin expansion in Well Construction, what the headwind we have a bit is the lower activity in North America, so that kind of masks the margin expansion internationally, but as we go through the year, you will see year-on-year growth in Well Construction. You have timing of certain stuff and adjustments on a quarterly basis. But on a year-on-year basis, you will clearly see margin expansion coming from international. Thank you."

            "name": "Olivier Le Peuch",
            "content": "Thank you, James. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on the call today. During my prepared remarks, I will discuss three topics. I will begin by sharing an overview of our first quarter results; then, I will provide an update on the ongoing market dynamics and highlight areas where we anticipate opportunities for further growth; and finally, I will conclude with our outlook for the full year and the second quarter. Stephane will then provide more details on our financial results, and we will open the line for your questions. Let's begin. I'm very pleased with our strong start to 2024. Year-on-year, revenue grew 13% and EBITDA grew in the mid-teens, in line with our full year financial ambitions. Additionally, we demonstrated the differentiated value we deliver to our customers, the impact of our continued capital discipline, and execution efficiency, by expanding year-on-year adjusted EBITDA margins for the 13th consecutive quarter. Internationally, we harnessed broad-based activity growth, with 21 of our 25 international GeoUnits increasing revenue year-on-year. Even when excluding the Aker contribution, our international revenue grew by double-digits. These impressive results were led by the Middle East & Asia, which exhibited remarkable growth of 29% compared to the same period a year ago. Specifically in the Middle East and North Africa, year-on-year growth was supported by continued investments in long-cycle developments and capacity expansion projects, in both oil and gas, across Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, Libya, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. And in Asia, we saw strong activity across the region led by offshore, notably in China, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and India. Meanwhile, in North America, activity remains soft due to weaker gas prices, sustained capital discipline, and the effects of ongoing market consolidation. The slower activity contributed to revenue in the region declining by 6% year-on-year. Next, I will comment on the Divisions' performance. I was very proud to see the power of the core divisions continue to drive our performance this quarter. In particular, you may have seen the remarkable growth in Production Systems, supported by our OneSubsea joint venture, and in Reservoir Performance, led by increased stimulation, evaluation, and intervention services. Well Construction also delivered resilient growth. I was also pleased to see our core margins visibly expand year-on-year, and I trust that this will continue as we remain focused on efficiency and value creation for our customers. Turning to Digital & Integration. I continue to follow our performance very closely. Although we experienced the typical pattern of seasonally slower sales to start the year, digital still grew in the double-digits year-on-year during the first quarter and we expect a visible uptick of digital sales throughout the rest of the year. This will be supported by increased customer adoption and a baseload of ongoing projects, as you can see from the quarterly highlights included in our press release this morning. For the full year, we maintain our ambition to grow our digital revenue in the high-teens. Overall, I am very pleased with this strong start to 2024. We will remain focused on the quality of our revenue, capital discipline, and execution efficiency to generate strong cash flows and shareholder returns throughout the year. I want to thank the entire SLB team for delivering this first quarter performance. They continue to operate at a benchmark level for the industry, and I feel privileged to work with such a dedicated and talented team. Next, let me shift into the ongoing market dynamics and how these are creating opportunities for our business. We are in the midst of a unique oil and gas cycle, characterized by strong market fundamentals, growing demand, and an even deeper focus on energy security. As described on several occasions, this cycle continue to display breadth, resilience, and longevity, this is very much the case in the Asia region where we are hosting this call today. In this context, there are certain priorities that are increasingly critical to our customers: project life-cycle reduction, particularly in exploration & appraisal to accelerate time to first gas or first oil; capital efficiency in the development phase to set new benchmarks in every basin; step change in production and recovery for producing assets and for unconventional resources; and finally, adoption of Digital & Al capabilities to transform operations and use of technology to abate emissions. Against this backdrop, we continue to innovate with our customers, through the combination of integration, fit-for-basin technologies, and digital, focusing on unlocking value by delivering lower-cost and lower-carbon barrels. In our Core oil and gas business, we are benefiting from these trends with our exposure to the fastest growing and most resilient markets. This cycle continues to be defined by broad growth across the international basins, and there is nowhere this is more evident than in the Middle East and global offshore markets. In the Middle East, countries are investing to increase both oil and gas supplies through the end of the decade. The long-cycle nature of the investments provides further confidence in the durability of the cycle, and we look forward to continue working with our customers to deliver on these targets. And offshore, many of the FIDs from the past few years have commenced, leading to broad-based activity across Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Europe. SLB has a strong foothold in each of these offshore regions, benefiting from our deep customer relationships, operational performance, and fit-for-basin solutions. Through our OneSubsea joint venture, we offer an unmatched pore-to-process offering throughout the full lifecycle of offshore assets, and we continue to deliver on our substantial offshore backlog. Now, looking at the priorities for producing assets today and tomorrow, we recognize the need to increase our exposure to the Production and Recovery market, including the more resilient OpEx spend, as operators work to offset natural decline, extend performance, and maximize the value of their assets. Our acquisition of ChampionX will further evolve our portfolio to capture this opportunity with the addition of a leading production chemicals business and well-established artificial lift (ph) portfolio with significant benefits to our customers in every producing basin in the world. This will be particularly visible in the offshore environment, which requires a higher intensity of production chemicals for flow assurance, reinforcing the long-cycle value of our offshore strategy. Another notable trend in the market is the enhanced focus on emissions reduction and low-carbon energy. Our early investments in this space are beginning to deliver promising results, both in the Core through our Transition Technologies, and in our New Energy portfolio, notably in Carbon Capture and Sequestration. CCS is one of the fastest-growing and most-immediate opportunities to reduce carbon emissions, and we are leveraging our domain expertise and deep knowledge of the subsurface to respond to an increased demand in our storage solutions. At the same time, we are also expanding to address opportunities throughout the CCS value chain. As you saw in our announcement a few weeks ago, we have entered into an agreement to combine our carbon capture business with Aker Carbon Capture and will own 80% of the combined entity. This is an exciting opportunity to bring together our complementary technology portfolios, leading process design expertise, and an established project delivery platform to innovate and deliver carbon capture technology solutions at an industrial scale. Looking across our broad portfolio, it is clear that our three engines of growth, each with differentiated technologies and exciting project pipelines, are positioning us for continued performance across all time horizons. Supported by our strong international portfolio and our unique technology driven approach to North America, we are truly making this investment cycle better for longer. Finally, I will conclude with our outlook for the full year and the second quarter. Based on the commentary I have just shared, the ongoing characteristics of the cycle, and our strong first quarter results, we remain confident in our full year financial guidance, with strength in international activity offsetting slower growth in North America. In particular, we anticipate the activity momentum in the international markets to continue, driven by increasing global demand and an even deeper focus on energy security. The relevance of oil and gas in the energy mix continues to support further investments in capacity expansion, particularly in the Middle East and in long-cycle projects across the global offshore markets, fully aligned with our international revenue ambitions. Additionally, we expect to realize further growth in the strengthening production and recovery market as operators work to maximize the efficiency and longevity of their producing assets. Altogether, this continues to present a very strong outlook for our business during 2024 and beyond. Specific to the second quarter, we expect sequential revenue growth internationally in the mid-single digits and North America in the low-single digits. We also expect to expand adjusted EBITDA margins by 75 bps to100 bps. By Division, we expect sequential growth to be led by Digital & Integration, followed by Reservoir Performance, Production Systems, and Well Construction, all of which are rebounding from the conclusion of winter seasonality. I will now turn the call over to Stephane. Thank you, Stephane. Ladies and gentlemen, I believe, we are opening the floor for your questions. Good morning Thank you, James. So from our perspective, I think, first and foremost, I think the cycle attributes that we have described earlier, the breadth, the resilience, the durability or the longevity of the cycle are fully in place and are driven by a combination of strong fundamental energy demand, oil and gas demand, if anything is trending upwards from the revision. Energy security is still on top of the agenda. There is no other place than Asia to realize this on the ground. And as such, I think the base of (ph) activity is being supported by very critical flow of investment, both as you said, in capacity expansion, which is already committed. But also, I think in short-cycle and long-cycle offshore, deepwater and shallow. And I think I was here in Asia, and it was remarkable to see the breadth, the diversity of the opportunity, the number of countries, offshore, onshore, the new exploration appraisal cycle, the new entrants that are coming in Southeast Asia, they were not before to invest because they are looking for securing gas supply, and they are looking to participate to maintain oil production. So I believe that if you combine this with what is happening in North America, which is North America operating within a threshold and not necessarily with significant anticipation of supply growth in that market in short term. This is only accentuating the characteristics of the cycle in international. And it can -- if I can reflect from the last two or three months of a lot of customer engagements, the sentiment is trending more positively than it was maybe six or 12 months ago. Hence, customer engaging to secure capacity on long projects such as deepwater and subsea, and they are looking for partnership collaboration to make sure that we help them into securing the best capital efficiency, as I highlighted, look for integration to accelerate the product cycle to get faster to first oil, first gas. So if anything, I think I see more, stronger pipeline of projects that will help us -- help this cycle to prolong beyond what we could have anticipated a year ago. I think the adoption continues to trend favorably. I think you'll continue to see as we deliver quarter-after-quarter both sorts of announcements in digital operation in cloud adoption for geoscience workflow or in data and AI, as you have seen the diversity of what we announced this quarter. I do expect the same next quarter and the following quarter because we believe that customers are realizing that they need to unlock efficiency and they need to accelerate the cycle, and they need to extract lower carbon solutions for their assets. So this is pulling. So we are still -- and we have renewed our ambition and targets to reach or exceed high teens for digital growth this year. And we started the year, I would say, considering the seasonal low - in the teens -- low teens growth year-on-year, double-digits, that was fully aligned with what we could have anticipated and it will continue. So I see quarter-after-quarter expansion of digital adoption. And I see more and more contribution from digital operations, be it drilling automation with production operation solutions, and you will see that in the coming quarter and the upcoming transaction with ChampionX will only strengthen this production operation offering as it will complement and give us another platform to expand our digital adoption. So I remain very constructive, and I believe that it is a long trend of digital adoption that will continue throughout the rest of the decade. Thank you, James. Good morning, David. Yeah. No, it's a fair question. And I think first and foremost, stepping back in time. I think we have been -- as we prepared our core strategy a few years back, we identified that production recovery in particular production chemicals, reservoir chemicals, and lift solutions will be a domain where we need to invest in technology, and we need to explore opportunity to accelerate our market participation because we believe two things: we believe first, that this market will benefit from further innovation, from further integration, from further disruption, and hence create through OpEx, the efficiency gains into production operations, into recovery. And we believe that the market is discovering to some extent has discovered, but has an opportunity to exploit more of these production chemicals, more of this optimized full life lift solution and combined with digital, so we believe that all in all, this market is not only an OpEx versus CapEx. This market is responding to increased demand, and increased opportunity we see in the market that has been there growing, and for which we are willing to respond and the customer feedback and engagement we had realizing the potential of what we can put together from technology from workflow integration, from automation and from optimization from the main reservoir knowledge to process equipment will clearly create a new leg into the technology deployment and into the efficiency of producing assets. So -- and I will not try to oppose OpEx/CapEx. I will just say that the production recovery is becoming critical- it has been for the last few quarters - has increasingly become part of the priority of our customers. Now we believe as well that this market has further resilience because the market, every liquid produced in the world, more or less demands an amount of production chemicals to assure its resilience in production. And at the same time, we believe that as the long term, most of the assets will see a higher water cuts, and some of the assets will see more complex reservoir fluids coming up to the process facility. There will be an increasing need to add in more sophisticated and more technical production chemicals to the flow. So all in all, an opportunity today and a resilient outlook for tomorrow. Exactly. I see what we see and in the engagement with customers, we see that in their quest for production recovery opportunity, we see that a combination of production chemicals, digital capability including optimizing some production lift solutions and overall intervention is in dire need for modernizing, innovation, and automation. And we believe that the addition of this to our portfolio, the significant talent and capability we are getting through the addition of ChampionX will help us fast-track this new path of production recovery market expansion. That would be a combination of OpEx and CapEx, and OpEx will only supplement and add opportunity for growth and it is not at all relating to where we are in the cycle for CapEx. Thank you, Dave. Yeah. Thank you, Arun. I think let me first maybe for simplicity and for aligning our views, maybe let me unpack first and give some additional color on this rig suspension. And I think these are public data, and I think a total of 20 to 22 rigs are being suspended to divest for consolidation. But this is in the context of this both Safaniya and Manifa projects, oil incremental project expansion program, that has been suspended. Both of these assets were having combined slightly above 20 jackups operating in these two assets at the end of last year. The anticipation of the additional rigs necessary for the expansion, we expect customers will add (corrected by company after the call) another dozen rigs. When you make the math at the end of this year, both of these assets will host slightly above 10 to a dozen rigs or a net 10 rigs less than the rig count at the (corrected by company after the call) end of last year. So that's first, what is happening on offshore. You contrast this with the gas market and a decision that was almost coincidental with the MSC decision, to increase the gas capacity towards 2030 by 60% compared to 2021. This is actually resulting in the total rig activity increase and net rig addition between now and the end of the year 2025 (added by company after the call) of a total approximately 35-40 (corrected by company after the call) rigs across the entire unconventional and conventional, both workover rigs, coiled tubing drilling units, and drilling rigs for the unconventional Jafurah and for the conventional gas. So this switch from offshore to onshore, the switch from oil to gas is actually the execution of strategy of Saudi Aramco, I believe. And it happened that we have market exposure that is long on land, very long on land and it's balanced and actually long on gas. So as a consequence for us, while this is an activity that has changed and a mix that wasn't anticipated six months ago, this will not have a natural impact on our ambition for growth for Saudi, this will not change our guidance for Middle East sustained growth. And this will continue to support our ambition to grow international and hence, the full guidance directed this morning. Yeah. I think that's a very good point. Actually, it's very broad growth and activity uptick in almost all the country with possible exception of Egypt these days, considering the cash and the valuation situation. But almost every other country is having a very significant growth and I have been citing a few countries this morning, and I could not stop listing all of them. And it includes Qatar that is starting to now remobilize for addition of the West North field. Obviously, Kuwait, as we commented earlier that is coming now very well structured to execute their capacity expansion, UAE on both gas and oil. Oman is very steady. Iraq, as you have seen, we have had some nice contracts also in that region. So we are very comfortable about the breadth, the diversity of the activity growth, rig activity growth, in the region. And actually, a couple of rigs or more could actually be redirected from the offshore Saudi contract to supplement and to help accelerate some activity in the region, while some others are already being retained to some extent for future activity here in the Southeast Asia. So I believe that the Middle East, as we said earlier, last year broke and had a total market spend that was record high. I think this record is just extending this year and with a very good breadth of oil and gas onshore and offshore activity despite a slight change of mix in Saudi. Thank you. Thank you, Neil. Yeah. I think that I'm contrasting, I think, some offset cases, so there will be increase. There was a plan that has not changed for Saudi to accelerate the gas expansion program, what has accelerated, what has improved, is the pace of this expansion program, driven by the raise of 50% to 60% target by 2030. And as a consequence of that, the whole year that was based on previous plans that now boosted by this accelerated expansion program will result into total rigs year-on-year that will, from beginning of the year to the end, add 35-40 (corrected by company after the call) rigs in total to the gas market, all onshore. So that's the reality of the market. Some of it in unconventional, up to 10 to 15 rigs in unconventional, some of it in the gas conventional, some of it in intervention and workover, so that's a total activity that gas is a strong market for Saudi, is becoming a significant market going forward. So that's where we expect activity to continue to grow going forward. And we are essentially favorably exposed to this activity set as we have an exposure that goes above, we are long on gas as we explained. And hence, we benefit from technology that we have deployed in Saudi that is fit for the Jafurah project, technology such as coiled tubing, underbalanced coiled tubing drilling solution, that is being used on Gabon gas and the technology that we use across for conventional gas is either integrated or discrete contracts. So that's the benefit we see, and that's the total rig that we see going forward. Maybe for clarity of the split on the net addition in the gas market in Saudi. The net addition due to the expansion acceleration is about 20 rigs. A bit more than half of that in a little bit more than half of that in unconventional and the rest in the conventional. So that's the resulting effect of this acceleration of gas expansion into Saudi. Hence, the shift indeed from offshore to onshore and from oil to gas characterized by this accelerated expansion translating to 20 rigs and the reduction of the net offshore from end of year last year to the end of the year this year that is above 10%, plus the mix changing for clients. Great question. I think, indeed, we had a reason to come here. And the reason why, first, the team has delivered and have been delivering a resilient growth and resilient margin expansion over the last two years since the rebound from the COVID time. And I think we have been observing, supporting the team, but I think spending two weeks in a region, I think, is clearly giving us a little bit more spotlight on to the strength of the region. I think, first and foremost, I have to say, this region is characterized by the critical resources they are putting to support security of supply, particularly gas, and investment they are going to, I would say, to support and stabilize oil production and prevent further decline. So stabilizing oil production and accelerating gas is certainly the feeling that has come on to the entire region. And I think it's further accentuated by energy security and is translating into a new wave of investments. It was very telling to see that in Indonesia, in Malaysia, in South -- in offshore China, in Bangladesh, in India. We are seeing new round of exploration appraisal that have not been seen with new entrants into this market that were not there, certainly a few years back. And I think this is creating a new set of opportunity, both offshore primarily and some of them in deepwater assets, and I think that will create further opportunity for Subsea. And at the same time, as I said, and I stress, there is also a focus independently onto supporting and preventing production decline for oil. And this is visible across all assets, both onshore and offshore, and hence, intervention recovery technology is being pulled to add investment. So you combine this wave of new investment for accelerating gas from exploration to development projects with this intervention recovery-focused production on the existing declining assets that exist here in all markets across the region, and we get the recipe for a significant investment and a steady investment in every country from Indonesia to Malaysia, to Thailand, China offshore and onshore, India, Bangladesh, as I said, a new country. And I think this is very interesting and very exciting for the team, and we are responding to this by deploying assets to bring the resources and creating fit technology for the market to help us grow and continue to succeed in this region. I think there are multiple aspects to this, okay? First and foremost, I think we have been operating also in production chemicals, albeit at a smaller scale in the international market. We are actually having quite a portfolio in reservoir chemicals that are helping us extract recovery and optimize our intervention and stimulation program also in international markets. And we believe that combining this will help us open and compare and optimize fit for reservoir solutions, fit for process facility solution. And I think we both are coming from different positional strengths. We have a process portfolio, equipment process portfolio, both onshore and onshore. We have reservoir chemicals and subsurface domain expertise and fluid expertise and they have obviously fluids and understanding of the reservoir, of the production chemistry portfolio. So I think combining both, I think, is, in our opinion, a unique opportunity and the feedback from customers is indicating that they see a lot of potential in this combination. We'll obviously try to add and extend this to a full integrated production solution, including digital including lift solutions, including intervention and including process equipment optimization that we deliver on FPSO and other places. So the place where this will have further effect, in my opinion, is an offshore environment. And also, we will compare and complement each other on trying to find low carbon and solutions that help also created further differentiated portfolio of sustainable production chemical portfolio for the market. So we have quite an upside in technology, in addition to having an upside on market expansion to use our international footprint to complement the strength of ChampionX production chemical in North America. Welcome. Thank you. Yeah. Great question. First and foremost, I think we see CCS is certainly the most obvious and the most attractive market, total addressable markets adjacent to our space where we can contribute to decarbonization of the industrial space. So we believe we are first at market position and a lot of play into the sequestration through our technology, to our digital and solution to deliver not only site selection, but also site characterization and development of sites for carbon sequestration. So that's -- and by doing this, we have significant access to a large number of customers within oil and gas through that, and beyond oil and gas through the operator, the emitters, that are willing to develop. So we have this as a starting point that give us market access across many of the FIDs and many of the projects, and we quoted more than 30 projects, we are always part of at any point in time. And I think we have had quite a lot of experience there. So we also have invested into capture technology that we have done, such as RTI for non-aqueous solvent, which are trying -- where we are trying to disrupt the intervention, we have to disrupt the economics of capture for low stream -- local concentration stream of CO2 in hard-to-abate sector. But what Aker Carbon Capture brings into this is a commercial solution platform or recommercialize that will serve us as a base for expansion for deployment of our capture technology. And also we'll build on the initial success they have had to deploy this platform to some European markets and use our footprint where we see the market evolving fast in North America, Middle East and in Asia and using this platform and being the go-to-market for this carbon capture solution that they are offering, but supplementing it with our innovation that we are investing in and using this as a platform to deploy innovation. So combining sequestration and capture to offer this combined opportunity for the customers as technology solution and using the platform of the commercial carbon capture, Aker Carbon Capture, that exists today, is commercial, and using it as a platform to deploy and add and supplement this with new disruptive technology. That's the purpose, and that's the intention we have, that's the ambition we have in this market. Yeah. I think we have been originally guiding and we are keeping our guidance that we believe that on a full year basis, it will be more muted than we had anticipated at the beginning of the year, considering the softness of the market at the start of the year, the persistent low gas price, the capital discipline and also the consolidation in the market. And we expect, going forward, we guided low-single digit growth sequentially. We anticipate at the end of the year to still outperform the market that will see a year-on-year decline on the activity by posting muted, but positive growth. But the shortfall that we may have, considering this offset will be fully offset by international growth as we commented where we see resilience, and we see further growth potential in many markets. So hence, we have reiterated our full year guidance. Thank you. Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, to conclude today's call, I would like to leave you with the following take-aways: first, the global energy landscape remains very compelling for our business. Demand for energy is accelerating, and this is resulting in strong activity dynamics that are closely aligned with our three engines of growth. We will continue to innovate with customers across our Core, Digital, and New Energy to meet this demand in the years to come. Second, SLB remains optimally positioned to harness the ongoing oil and gas cycle for further growth. We operate in the most resilient and fastest-growing markets internationally, and we have a unique portfolio of technologies and services that differentiate us in North America. Together, our unmatched footprint and offerings will continue to set us apart and drive our outperformance globally. And third, after a strong start to 2024 and with clear visibility into the year ahead, we look forward to achieving our full year financial ambitions and commitments to shareholders return. This is an exciting time in the industry, and I am fully confident in our strategy for the future. I couldn't hope for a better backdrop to continue delivering for our customers and shareholders. With that, we will conclude this morning's call. Thank you all for joining."
