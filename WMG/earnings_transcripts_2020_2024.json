And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Steve.\nStephen Cooper: Thanks, Kareem. Good morning, everyone, and thanks so much for joining us today. Looking back on the past year, despite the impact of the pandemic on our business, we're proud of everything we've accomplished. We've kept music fans engaged and excited with the flow of really great new releases and we've seen a marked acceleration in early-stage revenue streams such as social media, gaming, fitness and live streaming. Although effective vaccines may be on the horizon, companies across many different industries are still expecting a prolonged road to recovery. Against that backdrop, we're very fortunate to be in a global business creating something so vital to peoples' lives all over the world. And music, unlike other forms of entertainment, can be enjoyed wherever you are and whatever you are doing. With that in mind, I'd like to turn to our performance in the fourth quarter. While digital revenue grew 15% year-over-year, our total revenue was down 1%. Digital revenue growth was offset by steep declines in the areas of our business that are most aligned with touring and live appearances and therefore most disrupted by COVID. Specifically, those areas are artist's services and expanded-rights in recorded music and performance in music publishing. Excluding revenue from those areas, our growth in Q4 would have been approximately 9%, which clearly demonstrates the ongoing strength at the core of our business. Adjusted EBITDA was up by approximately 33% year-over-year. This highlights the operating leverage in our business, driven by the continuing shift from physical to digital, as well as our focus on operating cost discipline. Our recorded music revenue was down by about 1% is double-digit growth in digital, was offset by a 45% decline in artist services and expanded-rights revenue. As always, our primary focus is on creating and delivering a constant ever-growing flow of great new music. This quarter, Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion's WAP became the first female rap collaboration in history to debut at #1 on the Billboard Top-100. There was also an impressive diversity of releases across genres from country's Brett Eldredge to pop's Charlie Puth, to rap's Saweetie. On the international front, artists who topped the charts included Germany's Amigos and Kontra K, France's Aya Nakamura and Brazil's Anitta, whose Me Gusta had more than 140 million streams in just two months. Japan's Aimyon and Twice enjoyed huge successes helping drive our physical revenue from a decline earlier in the fiscal year to essentially flat in Q4. Our top selling artists for the fiscal year also showcased the power and range of our roster. From breakout sensations, Roddy Ricch and Tones and I, to new global icons, Dua Lipa and Lizzo, to megastar Ed Sheeran. Despite a solid overall year, revenue from our music publishing business declined about 3% in the quarter. More importantly, [Technical Difficulty] digital revenue in music publishing continued to be strong growing almost 30% year-over-year. This impressive jump was offset by declines in performance, where revenue was lost from the closing of bars, restaurants, clubs and concerts. Mechanical and sync were also down. That being said, sync has shown some recovery since fiscal Q3 with a gradual resumption of television and film production. Warner Chappell continued its creative revitalization as its writers contributed to 18 #1 albums on the Billboard 200 Chart during fiscal 2020. This included Pop Smoke's posthumous release Shoot for the Stars, Aim for the Moon. As the result of our aggressive global signing campaign, we attracted a growing number of world-class songwriters, including country star Thomas Rhett; iconic Mexican Group, Bronco; and the legendary Quincy Jones. The company also renewed its deals with a number of its global superstars, including Spain's Pablo Albor\u00e1n, Germany's Capital Bra and Sweden's Miss Li. Since our acquisition by Access in 2011, we've continued to evolve from an Anglo-American company into a global music entertainment enterprise. Today, our hits can come from anywhere and resonate everywhere. Our business now spans over 70 countries, and during COVID, we added to our global reach. Earlier this year, we opened new offices in Vietnam, India and Turkey, while Warner Chappell opened in Shanghai to capitalize on the exploding Chinese entertainment market. ADA, our independent label services division, expanded into Asia and Latin America. In addition, we forged innovative partnerships with Punjabi music specialist, Ziiki Media in India and with Africori, the largest music distributor in sub-Saharan Africa. If there has been a silver lining to the COVID cloud, it\u2019s been an opportunity to recalibrate our long view, accelerate the pace of change, and position ourselves to emerge from the pandemic stronger than ever. COVID has reinforced the importance of technology across every aspect of our business, from how we sign talent to how we market music and how we pay royalties. It\u2019s made us more agile, more efficient, and more precise. Just two quick examples. Since January, on a year-over-year basis, we doubled the number of new artists and songwriter signings identified through our proprietary A&R app, Sodatone. In the same timeframe, we've doubled the number of songwriters and tripled the number of recording artists using our royalty portals. Music is being woven into every aspect of our daily lives and we have the unique intellectual property that countless emerging platforms need. We are standing on the threshold of a new golden age of music and the opportunities are everywhere. As a result, we see subscription streaming as just the beginning. It is only one of our many avenues for long-term growth. With this in mind, we wanted to give you a look at what's on our horizon. First, the worlds of social media, gaming, and live streaming. With an expanding number of partnerships, including Facebook, TikTok and Snap, among others, social media is already a meaningful nine-figure revenue stream and is growing at a rate faster than subscription streaming. Billions of people are able to create the soundtrack of their lives. The creators are the audience and the audience are the creators, producing a massive multiplier effect. Artists and songwriters of all genres and generations, have the potential to go global at any moment. Thanks to a recent viral video, Fleetwood Mac's Dreams returned to Billboard's Top 10 more than 40 years after it was first released. COVID has supercharge the demand for 2D and 3D live streaming events and we successfully facilitated virtual concerts on platforms like WaveXR, Roblox and Fortnite. These platforms enable our artists to engage with audiences through an interactive immersive content that defies real-world limitations. Around these experiences we're also offering digital goods such as in game avatars. On track to be a several hundred-billion-dollar market by 2025, gaming is among the fastest growing sectors of digital media and we've positioned ourselves to forge meaningful partnerships within the gaming community. Second, we've expanded our involvement in other forms of entertainment content, like TV and podcasting. Especially with the rise of OTT, the demand for music driven programming, both audio and video, is rapidly increasing. WMG currently produces dozens of podcasts and we've already had some successes such as Digging Deep with Robert Plant. In 2017 we launched a dedicated film and TV division, Warner Music Entertainment. This group has been delivering a slate of fantastic projects such as Spike Lee's acclaimed film and David Byrne's American Utopia. We recently announced a major partnership with Imagine Entertainment, the production company behind movies like 8 Mile and TV shows like Empire. Third, we've created a growing network of owned and operated direct-to-consumer destinations. This makes us unique among the major music companies. We acquired social publishing platform, IMGN and music news site HipHopDX this year. They joined UPROXX, EMP and Songkick, as ways for us to gain early insight in the cultural trends and fan behavior. Our global e-tailer operations have adapted quickly to the new reality of the marketplace. For example, EMP, our European digital merchandiser launched and array of new products including a Stay-At-Home collection. And since the beginning of the pandemic, they have sold nearly half a million branded facemasks. Year-over-year their user base was up 10% and it is showing accelerating growth so far in the current fiscal year. Fourth, we\u2019re seeing explosive activity in the in-home fitness arena most notably through physical products like Peloton and Mirror, but also through virtual reality experiences like Supernatural and Oculus. According to Statista, the global fitness subscription market is already more than $23 billion. These services are still at low market penetration, but they are fueled by music and there\u2019s enormous potential for future growth. I also wanted to give you an update on our diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. Maurice Stinnett arrived in August to lead our efforts in this space, working with our teams around the world. These teams include our executive diversity and inclusion council, the employee resource groups and senior leadership. At the same time, the $100 million Warner Music Group, the Blavatnik Family Foundation's Social Justice Fund has gained momentum. The fund is making disbursements to organizations that are doing amazing work on the frontlines of anti-racism, community transformation, musicians\u2019 support and prisoners\u2019 rights. I also want to note that CC Kurtzman became the newest member of WMG's Board of Directors on October, 1. CC brings valuable independent expertise and perspective to the Board. In line with best practices in corporate governance all the members of the Board with the exception of myself are now external. Finally, as we look at 2021, we\u2019re expecting that our release schedule will be backend weighted with highly anticipated music from some of our global superstars. In this increasingly complex environment, we\u2019re the vital connective tissue between artists, fans and services. This gives our artists, songwriters and us the power to entertainment the world, shape the course of culture, and satisfy the essential human need for connection and solace. And now, over to Eric.\nEric Levin: Thank you, Steve, and good morning everyone. As you know, our fiscal year ended on September 30 and we released preliminary estimates of our results on October 19 in conjunction with the bond offering we launched at that time. COVID has obviously creating a unique set of challenges since taking hold in early March and has impacted certain areas of the business in the months that followed. Moving to our performance. In the quarter, our total revenue was down approximately 1% on a constant currency basis and effectively flat on an as reported basis compared against the prior year quarter. Artist services and expanded-rights and record music and performance in music publishing were the most affected areas due to the cancellation or postponement of touring. If you exclude those revenue streams, our revenue grew 9% on a constant currency basis and 11% on an as reported basis compared to the prior year quarter. For the full-year our total revenue was about flat on both a constant currency and as reported basis. Excluding revenue streams from artist services and expanded-rights and performance, our revenue grew 4% on both a constant currency and as reported basis compared to prior year. We saw significant growth in both adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter and full-year. In Q4, adjusted OIBDA increased approximately 35% to a $174 million with margins improving from 11.5% to 15.5%. This improvement was driven by an increase in contribution from higher margin streaming revenue, lower variable compensation expense and active cost management initiatives. Adjusted EBITDA increased 33% to $177 million with margins improving from 11.8% to 15.7%. The increase was largely due to the same factors that drove our adjusted OIBDA performance in addition to higher pro forma savings that we expect to realize from our transformation initiatives and the pro forma impacts of certain transactions closed in the quarter. For the full-year adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EBITDA increased 11% and 14% respectively, driven by a mix shift towards higher margin streaming revenue as well as lower operating costs. Adjusted OIBDA excludes one-time costs related to our IPO, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, COVID related expenses, the company\u2019s Los Angeles office consolidation, restructuring and other transformation initiatives. Adjusted EBITDA excludes these items and includes pro forma savings that we expect to realize from our transformation initiatives and add-backs for certain transactions. Please refer to our press release for calculations and reconciliations. In recorded music, Q4 revenue decreased by just under 1% over the prior year quarter. Digital revenue grew almost 13% driven by a 16% increase in streaming revenue which benefited from growth in revenue from emerging digital platforms and a significant recovery in ad supported streaming revenue compared to Q3. Physical revenue was flat and licensing revenue declined 6%. The decline in licensing revenue reflects the decrease in broadcast fees and synchronization revenue from lower advertising, television and film deal activity due to the impact of COVID. Artist services and expanded-rights revenue which includes merchandising declined 45%. For Q4, recorded music adjusted OIBDA increased 35% over the prior year quarter to $161 million due to a revenue mix shift towards digital and overall cost savings. Adjusted OEBIDA margin increased 4.3 percentage points to 16.8%. For the full year, recorded music revenue declined slightly as growth in digital was more than offset by declines in physical, artist services and expanded-rights and licensing revenue. Adjusted OIBDA increased by 12% with margin improving to almost 20%. Music publishing revenue declined 3% in Q4 as digital revenue grew by 28% driven by increases in streaming revenue and timing of digital deals which was more than offset by declines in performance and sync as well as a decrease in mechanical revenue. Music publishing adjusted OIBDA decreased by $1 million and margins remained flat. For the full-year, music publishing revenue increased by 3% and adjusted OIBDA decreased by 4%. In the fourth quarter, operating cash flow increased 17% to a $176 million compared to $151 million in the prior year quarter due to timing of working capital, including payments from certain digital services. Free cash flow decreased to $44 million compared to $115 million in the prior year quarter largely because of increased CapEx to support transformation initiatives and increased investment and acquisition activity partially offset by the higher operating cash flow. For the full-year, operating cash flow increased by 16% and free cash flow increased to $244 million from $24 million in the prior year. With reflected the acquisition of EMP for a $183 million in fiscal 2019 which was entirely financial debt. CapEx in the fourth quarter was $37 million compared to $22 million in the prior year quarter and was $85 million for the full year. The increase over the prior year quarter is related to our previously announced plans to upgrade our IT and finance infrastructure. We expect to invest approximately $20 million of the costs associated with this program in fiscal 2021 and annualized run rate savings from the program should be about $35 million to $40 million once fully implemented. For fiscal 2021, we expect total CapEx to be in the range of $90 million to a $100 million. Cash taxes were $81 million in fiscal 2020 and we expect they will be in the $90 million to $95 million range in 2021. On September 1, we paid our quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share, and on November 13, we announced our next quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share to be paid on December 1. As of September 30, we had a cash balance of $553 million and net debt of approximately $2.6 billion. On November 2, we completed a $250 million tack on to our 3% senior secured notes due 2031. The proceeds of this financing in conjunction with the cash on hand of approximately $90 million were used to fund two acquisitions of music and music related assets for aggregate cash consideration of $338 million. As we look ahead to the rest of fiscal 2021, while we don't give guidance, our expectations for full year revenue and adjusted EBITDA performance remained largely in line with our internal expectations at the time of the IPO. However, certain areas will be impacted by COVID. While our objective is to have a steady flow of great new music, there will always be lumpiness in our release schedule. Even without COVID our release schedule would have been back half weighted. The COVID has complicated the situation with the logistical and recording challenges it has created. That said, we expect streaming growth to continue to be strong through \u201821. So there are no material changes to our expectations for streaming, which represents about 60% of our total revenue today. We expect some slippage on our blockbuster albums to the back half of the year. We also expect our artist services and expanded-rights revenue, as well as performance revenue from bars and concerts will be second half weighted as economies reopen, since it's starting to recover, but should remain impacted in the first half of fiscal \u201821 due to film and TV production delays. The latest data show that film permits in LA grew by 24% in October versus September, and that filming activity is just under 50% of what is normal. Physical should see some bounce back, but overall, we expect to see continued decline. In 2020, we return to the public equity markets in the midst of a global pandemic that has challenged us to re-imagine our business. We look forward to continuing to drive music through all of the places and platforms where it touches our lives. We thank you for joining our call today, and we'll now open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Hey, good morning, guys. One for Steve and one for Eric, please. Steve, you've been talking for years about price points and subscription streaming, and it looks like we're starting to see prices move up based on what Spotify has talked about granted it's only seven markets. But key to this, I'm sure you would agree is that, the competitors don't start discounting for share and driving prices offsetting that trend upward with sort of a pricing war in the industry. So I'm wondering, what are your thoughts as someone who has been obviously focused on this for a while on the implications of Spotify's decision to start raising prices? And do you have any expectations for what the broader industry may do as its competitive set as a reaction? And then I'll just ask Eric. Eric, you guys completed a bunch of acquisitions in the quarter. I think based on the 8-K, there was a modest revenue impact, but a more substantial EBITDA impact. I wonder if you could just give us a little bit of color on what's going on there and what you guys acquired? Thanks.\nStephen Cooper: Okay. Hey, Ben, good morning, and happy holidays.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Good morning.\nStephen Cooper: So, first of all, we do think this is good news that Spotify is beginning to take more seriously upward bound pricing and the news that they're going to be testing in a number of countries was well received at least by us. I think that as subscription strength grows and as these services offer more verticals, that it is likely that we continue to see across a number of the more substantial players exercising their ability to raise prices. I'm sure you know, when Amazon added their high def tier, they raised the prices there. I think the other services, given that Spotify is essentially a pure play, we'll look at this as an opportunity to also test the market and follow along. I don't see any massive shift of subscribers from Spotify to other services. They obviously have created their playlists. They have their routines on Spotify. And as we said during the IPO, ultimately, the value of the years has to begin to catch up with the value of the eyeballs. I think this is a start. I\u2019m very hopeful that it will be a successful start and I believe this will give the other services the opportunity to follow.\nEric Levin: Great. And let me take your second question, Ben, and by the way, Happy Thanksgiving, everyone. The \u2013 on the two deals that we closed this quarter were a combination of music publishing and recorded music, domestic both catalog and go-forward rights. I think part of your question is by bringing up the revenue of 6 and the EBITDA of 37, some of these assets or many of these assets were ones where we had a partial position in and it allows us to consolidate those rights in those assets, so that we are having a significant weighted upside even though the revenue impact is less.\nBenjamin Swinburne: I see. Thank you both. Thanks.\nEric Levin: Yes. Thank you, Ben.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.\nHeath Terry: Great, thanks. I was wondering if we could spend a little bit more time on some of the new revenue opportunities you touched on earlier, particularly some of the social media areas, things like Twitch and TikTok. And when you look at the monetization framework for those, is there anything that you would compare them to? I mean, as we think about sort of the passive nature, at least in terms of song choice for most of the people consuming the music on those, does it make it more tend to your licensing models versus your streaming models? How would you have us think about sort of the potential there? If it's something completely new, where along the spectrum perhaps do you see it potentially falling as it matures? And then, when we look at that category in aggregate, is there a way that you would -- you could quantify it for us, either in terms of users or even better sort of hours consumed that would put it on par with, say, where streaming wise X number of years ago, or some way just to sort of give us a sense of where you see that opportunity in terms of its maturity at this point?\nEric Levin: Steve, do you want me to take that, Steve?\nStephen Cooper: Sure. Go ahead, Eric, and then I'll chime in if there's anything I could add.\nEric Levin: Fantastic. So, Heath, really interesting question. First, with -- the first question is really look more like streaming or more like licensing. Really, these look more like streaming and the way I think of it or I think the way we think of it is licensing is generally more of a case-by-case type situation, whereas these really are full catalog plus new music licenses, access to the full portfolio and that is much more like streaming. The use cases obviously by whether it's a social service, a fitness service, or even within social services can be very different. But it's really content that is selected, accessing a vast array of catalog and constantly being updated with new music is much more like streaming. Now, each case is different and the deal structure that reflects the appropriate monetization for music and its relative value given to the overall content is different on a case-by-case basis. And those have to be evaluated and negotiated as these business models evolve and it clarifies exactly how they're monetizing, exactly the role of music players. Quantifying it versus streaming is a little challenging in a very linear way, but I can try and do it directionally. What we would say is the first thing with streaming that makes it relatively straightforward to quantify is, you can all assess the TAM, the Total Addressable Market, if you look at the Smartphones, and then you could start to track penetration and see what the addressable market is. It\u2019s much harder to do with the social fitness live gaming services, because with streaming services, in general, this is simplification. You're likely going to have one per home, and it's competition to get as many homes as you can. With social and fitness and other services, you can have many -- monetize, used and monetized within an individual home. One person may use TikTok in a home and Facebook and their brother or sister may use Instagram and they may have a Peloton or another. So your total addressable market really becomes enormous when we think about multiple services and in each home and new services launching that use music all the time that continue to increase that potential. What we can say is that, each of these businesses, gaming is already $100 billion business, fitness is already a $10 billion, $20 billion to $30 billion business and growing rapidly. And that our revenue streams from these, which three years ago, were really nascent, now is $100 million annually and growing extremely fast. So what we -- if I was equating this to streaming, I would say this would be the very, very early days of streaming, when people were just discovering it, and its rate of growth was accelerated. And I think we see this as a high-growth portion of the business for quite some time and its ability to grow to large numbers is we think, very meaningful. But I apologize, I can't do it with numbers in a better way, because its total addressable market is just, we think magnified by the fact that there could be multiple services utilized per home.\nStephen Cooper: Heath, I would just supplement that with a thought, particularly with TikTok. When you look at this service, the creators are the audience and the audiences are the creators. And the way the TikTok users are utilizing that service, from at least our perspective, increases the ability of music to go viral. And it goes viral because for these users, it's not a social platform it's a game where we're the creators trying to track their fellow creators and vice versa. And the utilization of music, the utilization of these contests, these dares, not all of them safe at times, has just produced from our perspective a tremendous multiplier effect by way of utilization, and we see that continuing for the foreseeable future.\nHeath Terry: Great, thank you both.\nStephen Cooper: Thanks, Heath.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Russo with Credit Suisse.\nBrian Russo: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. I've got two for Steve on the publishing business, and then one for Eric. So for Steve, you recently made a significant catalog purchase. And given all of the headlines around sort of Taylor Swift and the friction between her and the owners of her IP, I was just hoping you could talk about how you ensure that Warner Chappell maintains a positive relationship with the artists? That's one. The second question on publishing is, is that we're clearly seeing a lot of capital being put to work buying up catalogs. So maybe you could talk a little bit about what value Warner can bring to a catalog, such that when you make an acquisition, you can generate healthy and attractive returns even in the current climate of rising valuations? And then last for Eric, right now the Street is expecting your total revenue growth to improve next year, and adjusted EBITDA to grow more or less right along with it roughly the same pace. So the question is, is that a reasonable expectation for adjusted EBITDA do you think? Maybe you could highlight for us any swing factors that might prevent adjusted EBITDA from growing around the same pace as your revenue next year? Thanks.\nStephen Cooper: Okay, thanks, Brian for the questions. So, first of all, with respect to publishing assets, artist relations, so on and so forth, in our latest acquisition, we were approached by our artist and the artists wanted to sell part of his rights and we were able in a very cordial way to work out a deal that he or she was very happy with and we were very happy with. We do not typically sell rights. We are more often than not, and acquired rights, but we are very, very, very sensitive to how our artists feel about those transactions. Frankly, we have turned down transactions where the artist was not happy, where the artist was not inclined to be supportive, because we are in the business on both sides of our businesses, long-term artist development. So we're -- when we look at the Taylor Swift, the ongoing back and forth between Taylor and Braun, and Taylor and Shamrock, those are types of situations that we look to avoid. One of the reasons that we do these transactions, and one of the reasons that we're in the publishing business is that we have a platform that can not only administrate copyrights, but a platform and an organization that can amplify their success Brian. We have -- we are a full service shop. So once rights are acquired, we go to work on syncs, we go to work, inviting these writers into writing camps, we go to work trying to match songs to artists that we know we're looking for, new product, new sounds, innovative tunes and lyrics. And our business is to work with our artists and those copyrights to create more momentum and more success by being proactive and not letting them sit in a vault for the next 5,10 or 15 years. What we see with other investments coming into the market where substantial capital is put against these investments, those organizations are investment organizations. And, frankly, it looks to me like it's a fixed income arbitrage play, as opposed to how do we work with the artists in these copyrights to ensure that we are doing everything we can proactively to optimize the results of their songwriting efforts. So we're in a different business. We're operators that work with our artists on investments. We're not an investment house, that's looking to arbitrage fixed income Brian.\nBrian Russo: Makes sense.\nEric Levin: And I'll take the \u201821 question on growth. So Brian, as you know, we don't give guidance. So I'll answer perhaps a little generally, but I'll try and answer as clearly as I can. So first and foremost, we manage our business for growth. We manage to drive strong growth in our business. One of the metrics we discussed on the call was that Q4 revenue growth, excluding artist services, and in Warner Chappell performance grew 9%. The underlying business, he despite the areas affected by COVID is still showing very strong growth. We don't control what's going to happen with COVID next year and specifically, those that are related to touring, those revenues related to touring as artist services and performance in publishing could be affected for parts of next year. One, we believe there are opportunities to really focus on driving the areas that are available for growth and getting really strong growth out of them. And when the impacts of COVID subside to make sure we're poised to immediately capitalize on the opportunities of those areas that are resuming growth in Q4 alone. You saw ad supported streaming improve. You saw physical improve and we saw early signs of sync revenue improving. So we're already seeing signs of improvement in key areas of revenue and in \u201821, we will capitalize on those opportunities regardless of when these revenue opportunities start to improve. We are also very focused on driving bottom-line growth, just like we did in \u201820, when there were certain revenue streams that were growing well, and other that were limited by COVID, we focused on managing costs, putting our resources at -- into place where they'll drive the best bottom-line results and performance in the market. And we expect to continue to do that in \u201821. Continuing to drive bottom-line growth by focusing on spend in the areas where it can drive impact and in the areas where it can, making sure we're managing very actively. In addition to that, we have our cost containment initiatives, which will start to roll online in fiscal \u201821 obviously expanding over time. Thanks, Brian.\nBrian Russo: Understood, thanks guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rich Greenfield with LightShed Partners.\nRichard Greenfield: Hi, thanks for taking the question. We've seen a lot of -- there's been a lot of talk surrounding what's going on in the video game space, with Twitch and others looking at takedown notices. And it feels in many ways what the music industry accomplished with YouTube many years ago. I was wondering if you could sort of give us a roadmap of what do you think happens in the video game space? How does this play out over time? And how significant can the revenue? Or can the dollars be more broadly for the industry, but obviously for Warner as well?\nStephen Cooper: So, Eric, why don't I start and then you can add in anything you want. So I think there are actually two ways that we're looking at this Rich. One is the point you touched on, which is, obviously, when people are utilizing our music or anyone else's music, we believe that should be licensed. So in many respects, you're right, this looks like the early days of YouTube. But we and the gaming world are not much better organized than they were 15 or 20 years ago. So, fact of the matter is, Twitch is talking to the industry about licensing the music and obviously based upon the use cases that license will be narrow, it will be broad it will be on terms and conditions that support the use cases and support the growth of those use cases. So that's one avenue. The second avenue that we see as being as or more productive, are partnering with gaming companies. So that inside of the immersive worlds they're creating, Warner Music has the right sort of beachfront properties, sort to speak, where we are inside of those games, within conjunction with our artists or artists avatars, are providing entertainment, are holding concerts are bringing people to the Warner Music arena for other events. It's an opportunity to sell virtual goods. It's an opportunity to sell real world goods. And it's an opportunity to create a broader Canvas for our artists to paint on. So we are looking this, we're looking at gaming as a multidimensional opportunity for Warner Music and for our artists in the years ahead. Eric, you may want to add to that.\nRichard Greenfield: But, Stephen, just before you move on just I\u2019d love the answer. When you look at Roblox going public, will we start to get a flavor of part two, as people start to dig into Roblox, will we see some of what you're talking about?\nStephen Cooper: Well, fingers crossed that you will, because these games and these gaming worlds have to continue to expand their offerings to continue to attract and hold at the players in their games and their universe so to speak Rich. So just like we can't stay static, they can't stay static. And partnering with people like Warner Music gives them an opportunity to bring some of the world's greatest music, some of the world's greatest artists into their main events, which is good for them and good for us because these type of events attract millions upon millions of gamers and they add flavor to the game, that would be absent without music and our artists. So the answer is yes, in the future you should expect to see more of our participation in the gaming world and participating in a way that we create value for artists. We create value for the game, for the game companies and we create value for Warner Music.\nEric Levin: And just to put a button on that, one of our artists, Ava Max just recently had a live stream event on Roblox, so we're already at work, actively working with that platform and agree with everything Steve said this is a vital robust area that's more and more fully.\nRichard Greenfield: Thank you both for the detailed answer. I appreciate it.\nEric Levin: Thanks, Rich.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with BOA Securities.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: All right, thank you, good morning. I have three different questions. First on, I think this one is for Steve, Steve you talked a lot about how important it is to go global. Where are you now versus your long-term aspirations and what percent of your artists are -- of your biggest revenue is local repertoire versus Anglo? Is there any difference in margins between Anglo and the rest of the world? Second question, our topic is on live, I'm sure we're all super excited about the potential vaccine and getting back to life as we know it, but how do you think about or what do you anticipating for live to come back at scale and how should we think about the financial risk? It's scaled, live, touring, is pushed to '22 versus the summer of '21? And then the third and final question is on marketing. Spotify is testing a new discovery mode, which allows artists and labels to influence the song selected by its algorithm, by the seasonal or royalty payout. How does this feature affect your marketing strategy? And how do you think about the importance of marketing within that ecosystem or in DSPs in general, versus marketing or promoting music through other channels? Thank you.\nStephen Cooper: So Eric, I'll take the kind of the global and the marketing and you can take the couple in between. Thanks for your questions, Jessica. Our ambition is, we've said historically, music is the only universal language on the planet and our ambition is to be able to be speaking that music in every language on the planet. As we mentioned during our IPO process, we have expanded tremendously over the last seven or eight years, our global footprint and it was an intentional expansion to turn this from an Anglo-centric to a truly global music entertainment company. That expansion is going to continue. We are constantly looking at opportunities outside of, well, we're looking at opportunities inside the U.S. inside the U.K., but also in the rest of the world, because when you look at streaming or you look at gaming, or you look at TikTok, they are global enterprises and the people that utilize them are an army of global citizens. We want to be in that same place where we are global and we are an army of music content deliverers to people around the world that are looking not only for music in English, but music in their local languages. And one of the reasons we are so intent upon this expansion is that typically more than 50% of the music listened to in any local area is the local music. So that while Anglo music travels well globally, and is a powerful mover of culture, at the local level, the predominant form of music is local music. And therefore, you've got to be better, because we are global and we want to be able to speak music in all of the languages of the globe. On the Spotify question, we look at and we evaluate marketing tools all the time to the extent where we find tools that we believe for the cost, provide an adequate rate of return, we will experiment with them, experiment with them, experiment with them and if they work, we will continue. If we find that the cold is worse than the cure, sort to speak, or the cure is worse than the cold, I guess, is the way that phrase goes, we move on to other tools that provide us with better results and better rates of return. So we have views. We are experimenting with the Spotify Marquee, but it remains to be seen how valuable a tool that will be. And with that, I'll turn it over to -- and hopefully that answered your question Jessica and I'll turn it over to Eric now.\nEric Levin: I think there are a couple more, I'll try and hit it quickly. One, you're asking about local versus Anglo margin on repertoire and I would say, in general, our [indiscernible] businesses and our domestic business, similar margins. There's each piece of music can be very different and each country around the world is different. There are countries that really are dominantly local music, and the International is less a piece of the pie. And - in every business, virtually every business where we do business, we're producing significant amount of local language, local music. One thing about Anglo [indiscernible] globally, the marketing often happens in this post market. And then when it goes overseas, although there is marketing in other markets, it does take advantage of the initial marketing, and its home market release when it goes globally and their candy, kind of called it scale or reap benefits of marketing, for the music that goes global, whereas local music always needs to be marketed locally to make sure we do everything we can to break that artist and that music locally. So the differences are often in marketing more than anything else and where the marketing spend is to break individual piece of music. And then on live, I would say there's two ways two components for that. One is for our business, while a lot has been on hold for the past eight months, we have pivoted how we break and promote music given that that's no longer part of the equation and I think have been very effective in developing marketing programs and techniques that allow artists and their music to reach fans and break across platforms locally and globally. For us specifically, and how it affects Warner Music Group financially, obviously there's -- we have concert promotion, businesses and tour merch businesses within artist services. Those have larger revenue than a bottom-line impact. Those tend to be our lower margin businesses. So with those businesses, we obviously manage costs, or that, although there'll be a top line, in fact, a very limited impact on our bottom-line. And we'll continue to monitor those really closely and as tour live starts to resume, we fully expect to re-energize our tour merch business and our concert promotion businesses in certain markets. Again, those are a fraction of our revenue. And an even smaller portion of our bottom-line is that we do expect to re-energize over time when touring restarts. Thanks, Jessica.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our last question comes from Matthew Thornton with Truist Securities.\nMatthew Thornton: Hi, good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe one for Steve and then two clarifications for Eric, if I could. Steve, coming back to live here just for a second, given the reach of DSPs at this point and given the rise of live streaming here during COVID, I'm curious your thoughts as to how you're leaning into the opportunity or if you think there is an opportunity here to really accelerate, when we come out of COVID to re-accelerate live as it relates to your touring business, your merchandising performance on the music publishing side? I'm curious to hear your latest thoughts there. And then just Eric, maybe two points of clarification. First, you talked about 9% growth in the revenue lines not impacted by COVID, but I think that's still includes advertisers. So I'm curious, is advertising fully recovered in your view or do we still have some ways to go there, and then just a paraphrase your commentary on fiscal \u201821 just to make sure that we got it right, it sounds like you're looking for results. I assume that means revenue and adjusted OIBDA, adjusted EBITDA, largely in line with kind of what you articulated coming out of the IPO process. It sounds like maybe it's a little more second half weighted, but otherwise largely consistent. Guys I want to make sure that we kind of heard that all correctly. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.\nStephen Cooper: Great, so just to be crystal clear Matt, we see live in a couple of ways. First of all, we think there's a very reasonable probability that this last 7, 8, 9 months and the continuing COVID assault has begun and has changed a number of people's habits. So when we talk about live and we talk about touring, our intent is to continue to invest in live streaming, live concerts, VR concerts, and continue to support not only new habits, but the marketplace for this sort of entertainment at home. Because we believe at least, even with the announcement of the vaccines, the distribution is going to be very difficult for the foreseeable future. And we think that there is going to be an ongoing market for live streaming, for VR concerts, so on and so forth. When it comes to live touring per se, based upon the success of any of these potential vaccines, and the way people are thinking at that point in time, will determine how successful the return to live is. My own personal view is that there are going to be, there's going to be some change of thinking about packing yourself into stadiums or arenas. I think there's some concern about returning to a mass for this society and I'm not smart enough to know how all of this is going to play out. But what I do believe is that the new normal, whether it's the summer, whether it's later in \u201821, or it's differed to \u201822, the new normal is going to look different than the old normal that we were all used to in 2017, 2018, and 2019. How it plays out, I think is highly uncertain. But what I do know, as people's habits are changing, our intent is to identify these trends, and ensure that whichever way the wind blows, we are there to support them with our music and our artists, that much I do know.\nEric Levin: Great, let me tackle Matthews last two questions, so and thank you for them. They're good things to just make sure we take a moment and clarify. So on the Q4 revenue numbers that we quoted, which was 9%, growth, revenue growth in Q4, excluding artist services, and recorded music, and performance on music publishing, that's just meant to be represent math. In two of the areas that were most affected by COVID, if you pull them out that the rest of the business is still showing 9%, close to double-digit growth. But to clarify your point, you're right. In that 9% are still areas that are materially affected by COVID. So then think and licensing is still in there. As we said in our prepared remarks, TV and film production is still only a fraction of what it was pre-COVID and what we expect it to be once we come out of COVID, so think in licensing opportunities, we think has a significant opportunity to rebound in Warner Chappell sync was up 17% in the first half of fiscal of '20 and was down in the second half of '20. So there's significant upside, still within the areas covered in the 9%. But we just wanted to give we'll call it a simple algebraic metric so you could see how much if you pull out two of the most impacted areas are the underlying business was growing, but you're right, there's ups. And then the second piece was on the '21 weighting towards the second half of the year. That is right. We are saying that the full year our internal expectations at the time of the IPO for the full year, is what we are still targeting and we believe it is something that we can strive for. But that based on timing of revenue streams, which are impacted by COVID, and timing of our release schedule, that our business will be somewhat more second half weighted correct. Thank you, Matt.\nStephen Cooper: Go ahead.\nOperator: And I was going to turn it back over to you guys for closing comments.\nEric Levin: Steve, did you want to make closing comments Steve?\nStephen Cooper: Sure. I want to get this very brief. Just thanks everyone for taking the time out of what I'm sure you're busy schedules to join us today and I hope that everyone has a safe and a wonderful Thanksgiving and I hope that we all stay not only safe, but sane. So, we'll talk to you in a few months. Thanks, everybody and happy holidays.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's presentation. We thank you for your participation. You may all disconnect and have a wonderful day. Speakers, please standby.",

            "name": "Eric Levin",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve, and good morning everyone. As you know, our fiscal year ended on September 30 and we released preliminary estimates of our results on October 19 in conjunction with the bond offering we launched at that time. COVID has obviously creating a unique set of challenges since taking hold in early March and has impacted certain areas of the business in the months that followed. Moving to our performance. In the quarter, our total revenue was down approximately 1% on a constant currency basis and effectively flat on an as reported basis compared against the prior year quarter. Artist services and expanded-rights and record music and performance in music publishing were the most affected areas due to the cancellation or postponement of touring. If you exclude those revenue streams, our revenue grew 9% on a constant currency basis and 11% on an as reported basis compared to the prior year quarter. For the full-year our total revenue was about flat on both a constant currency and as reported basis. Excluding revenue streams from artist services and expanded-rights and performance, our revenue grew 4% on both a constant currency and as reported basis compared to prior year. We saw significant growth in both adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter and full-year. In Q4, adjusted OIBDA increased approximately 35% to a $174 million with margins improving from 11.5% to 15.5%. This improvement was driven by an increase in contribution from higher margin streaming revenue, lower variable compensation expense and active cost management initiatives. Adjusted EBITDA increased 33% to $177 million with margins improving from 11.8% to 15.7%. The increase was largely due to the same factors that drove our adjusted OIBDA performance in addition to higher pro forma savings that we expect to realize from our transformation initiatives and the pro forma impacts of certain transactions closed in the quarter. For the full-year adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EBITDA increased 11% and 14% respectively, driven by a mix shift towards higher margin streaming revenue as well as lower operating costs. Adjusted OIBDA excludes one-time costs related to our IPO, non-cash stock-based compensation expense, COVID related expenses, the company's Los Angeles office consolidation, restructuring and other transformation initiatives. Adjusted EBITDA excludes these items and includes pro forma savings that we expect to realize from our transformation initiatives and add-backs for certain transactions. Please refer to our press release for calculations and reconciliations. In recorded music, Q4 revenue decreased by just under 1% over the prior year quarter. Digital revenue grew almost 13% driven by a 16% increase in streaming revenue which benefited from growth in revenue from emerging digital platforms and a significant recovery in ad supported streaming revenue compared to Q3. Physical revenue was flat and licensing revenue declined 6%. The decline in licensing revenue reflects the decrease in broadcast fees and synchronization revenue from lower advertising, television and film deal activity due to the impact of COVID. Artist services and expanded-rights revenue which includes merchandising declined 45%. For Q4, recorded music adjusted OIBDA increased 35% over the prior year quarter to $161 million due to a revenue mix shift towards digital and overall cost savings. Adjusted OEBIDA margin increased 4.3 percentage points to 16.8%. For the full year, recorded music revenue declined slightly as growth in digital was more than offset by declines in physical, artist services and expanded-rights and licensing revenue. Adjusted OIBDA increased by 12% with margin improving to almost 20%. Music publishing revenue declined 3% in Q4 as digital revenue grew by 28% driven by increases in streaming revenue and timing of digital deals which was more than offset by declines in performance and sync as well as a decrease in mechanical revenue. Music publishing adjusted OIBDA decreased by $1 million and margins remained flat. For the full-year, music publishing revenue increased by 3% and adjusted OIBDA decreased by 4%. In the fourth quarter, operating cash flow increased 17% to a $176 million compared to $151 million in the prior year quarter due to timing of working capital, including payments from certain digital services. Free cash flow decreased to $44 million compared to $115 million in the prior year quarter largely because of increased CapEx to support transformation initiatives and increased investment and acquisition activity partially offset by the higher operating cash flow. For the full-year, operating cash flow increased by 16% and free cash flow increased to $244 million from $24 million in the prior year. With reflected the acquisition of EMP for a $183 million in fiscal 2019 which was entirely financial debt. CapEx in the fourth quarter was $37 million compared to $22 million in the prior year quarter and was $85 million for the full year. The increase over the prior year quarter is related to our previously announced plans to upgrade our IT and finance infrastructure. We expect to invest approximately $20 million of the costs associated with this program in fiscal 2021 and annualized run rate savings from the program should be about $35 million to $40 million once fully implemented. For fiscal 2021, we expect total CapEx to be in the range of $90 million to a $100 million. Cash taxes were $81 million in fiscal 2020 and we expect they will be in the $90 million to $95 million range in 2021. On September 1, we paid our quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share, and on November 13, we announced our next quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share to be paid on December 1. As of September 30, we had a cash balance of $553 million and net debt of approximately $2.6 billion. On November 2, we completed a $250 million tack on to our 3% senior secured notes due 2031. The proceeds of this financing in conjunction with the cash on hand of approximately $90 million were used to fund two acquisitions of music and music related assets for aggregate cash consideration of $338 million. As we look ahead to the rest of fiscal 2021, while we don't give guidance, our expectations for full year revenue and adjusted EBITDA performance remained largely in line with our internal expectations at the time of the IPO. However, certain areas will be impacted by COVID. While our objective is to have a steady flow of great new music, there will always be lumpiness in our release schedule. Even without COVID our release schedule would have been back half weighted. The COVID has complicated the situation with the logistical and recording challenges it has created. That said, we expect streaming growth to continue to be strong through \u201821. So there are no material changes to our expectations for streaming, which represents about 60% of our total revenue today. We expect some slippage on our blockbuster albums to the back half of the year. We also expect our artist services and expanded-rights revenue, as well as performance revenue from bars and concerts will be second half weighted as economies reopen, since it's starting to recover, but should remain impacted in the first half of fiscal \u201821 due to film and TV production delays. The latest data show that film permits in LA grew by 24% in October versus September, and that filming activity is just under 50% of what is normal. Physical should see some bounce back, but overall, we expect to see continued decline. In 2020, we return to the public equity markets in the midst of a global pandemic that has challenged us to re-imagine our business. We look forward to continuing to drive music through all of the places and platforms where it touches our lives. We thank you for joining our call today, and we'll now open the call for questions. Great. And let me take your second question, Ben, and by the way, Happy Thanksgiving, everyone. The \u2013 on the two deals that we closed this quarter were a combination of music publishing and recorded music, domestic both catalog and go-forward rights. I think part of your question is by bringing up the revenue of 6 and the EBITDA of 37, some of these assets or many of these assets were ones where we had a partial position in and it allows us to consolidate those rights in those assets, so that we are having a significant weighted upside even though the revenue impact is less. Yes. Thank you, Ben. Steve, do you want me to take that, Steve? Fantastic. So, Heath, really interesting question. First, with -- the first question is really look more like streaming or more like licensing. Really, these look more like streaming and the way I think of it or I think the way we think of it is licensing is generally more of a case-by-case type situation, whereas these really are full catalog plus new music licenses, access to the full portfolio and that is much more like streaming. The use cases obviously by whether it's a social service, a fitness service, or even within social services can be very different. But it's really content that is selected, accessing a vast array of catalog and constantly being updated with new music is much more like streaming. Now, each case is different and the deal structure that reflects the appropriate monetization for music and its relative value given to the overall content is different on a case-by-case basis. And those have to be evaluated and negotiated as these business models evolve and it clarifies exactly how they're monetizing, exactly the role of music players. Quantifying it versus streaming is a little challenging in a very linear way, but I can try and do it directionally. What we would say is the first thing with streaming that makes it relatively straightforward to quantify is, you can all assess the TAM, the Total Addressable Market, if you look at the Smartphones, and then you could start to track penetration and see what the addressable market is. It's much harder to do with the social fitness live gaming services, because with streaming services, in general, this is simplification. You're likely going to have one per home, and it's competition to get as many homes as you can. With social and fitness and other services, you can have many -- monetize, used and monetized within an individual home. One person may use TikTok in a home and Facebook and their brother or sister may use Instagram and they may have a Peloton or another. So your total addressable market really becomes enormous when we think about multiple services and in each home and new services launching that use music all the time that continue to increase that potential. What we can say is that, each of these businesses, gaming is already $100 billion business, fitness is already a $10 billion, $20 billion to $30 billion business and growing rapidly. And that our revenue streams from these, which three years ago, were really nascent, now is $100 million annually and growing extremely fast. So what we -- if I was equating this to streaming, I would say this would be the very, very early days of streaming, when people were just discovering it, and its rate of growth was accelerated. And I think we see this as a high-growth portion of the business for quite some time and its ability to grow to large numbers is we think, very meaningful. But I apologize, I can't do it with numbers in a better way, because its total addressable market is just, we think magnified by the fact that there could be multiple services utilized per home. And I'll take the \u201821 question on growth. So Brian, as you know, we don't give guidance. So I'll answer perhaps a little generally, but I'll try and answer as clearly as I can. So first and foremost, we manage our business for growth. We manage to drive strong growth in our business. One of the metrics we discussed on the call was that Q4 revenue growth, excluding artist services, and in Warner Chappell performance grew 9%. The underlying business, he despite the areas affected by COVID is still showing very strong growth. We don't control what's going to happen with COVID next year and specifically, those that are related to touring, those revenues related to touring as artist services and performance in publishing could be affected for parts of next year. One, we believe there are opportunities to really focus on driving the areas that are available for growth and getting really strong growth out of them. And when the impacts of COVID subside to make sure we're poised to immediately capitalize on the opportunities of those areas that are resuming growth in Q4 alone. You saw ad supported streaming improve. You saw physical improve and we saw early signs of sync revenue improving. So we're already seeing signs of improvement in key areas of revenue and in \u201821, we will capitalize on those opportunities regardless of when these revenue opportunities start to improve. We are also very focused on driving bottom-line growth, just like we did in \u201820, when there were certain revenue streams that were growing well, and other that were limited by COVID, we focused on managing costs, putting our resources at -- into place where they'll drive the best bottom-line results and performance in the market. And we expect to continue to do that in \u201821. Continuing to drive bottom-line growth by focusing on spend in the areas where it can drive impact and in the areas where it can, making sure we're managing very actively. In addition to that, we have our cost containment initiatives, which will start to roll online in fiscal \u201821 obviously expanding over time. Thanks, Brian. And just to put a button on that, one of our artists, Ava Max just recently had a live stream event on Roblox, so we're already at work, actively working with that platform and agree with everything Steve said this is a vital robust area that's more and more fully. Thanks, Rich. I think there are a couple more, I'll try and hit it quickly. One, you're asking about local versus Anglo margin on repertoire and I would say, in general, our [indiscernible] businesses and our domestic business, similar margins. There's each piece of music can be very different and each country around the world is different. There are countries that really are dominantly local music, and the International is less a piece of the pie. And - in every business, virtually every business where we do business, we're producing significant amount of local language, local music. One thing about Anglo [indiscernible] globally, the marketing often happens in this post market. And then when it goes overseas, although there is marketing in other markets, it does take advantage of the initial marketing, and its home market release when it goes globally and their candy, kind of called it scale or reap benefits of marketing, for the music that goes global, whereas local music always needs to be marketed locally to make sure we do everything we can to break that artist and that music locally. So the differences are often in marketing more than anything else and where the marketing spend is to break individual piece of music. And then on live, I would say there's two ways two components for that. One is for our business, while a lot has been on hold for the past eight months, we have pivoted how we break and promote music given that that's no longer part of the equation and I think have been very effective in developing marketing programs and techniques that allow artists and their music to reach fans and break across platforms locally and globally. For us specifically, and how it affects Warner Music Group financially, obviously there's -- we have concert promotion, businesses and tour merch businesses within artist services. Those have larger revenue than a bottom-line impact. Those tend to be our lower margin businesses. So with those businesses, we obviously manage costs, or that, although there'll be a top line, in fact, a very limited impact on our bottom-line. And we'll continue to monitor those really closely and as tour live starts to resume, we fully expect to re-energize our tour merch business and our concert promotion businesses in certain markets. Again, those are a fraction of our revenue. And an even smaller portion of our bottom-line is that we do expect to re-energize over time when touring restarts. Thanks, Jessica. Great, let me tackle Matthews last two questions, so and thank you for them. They're good things to just make sure we take a moment and clarify. So on the Q4 revenue numbers that we quoted, which was 9%, growth, revenue growth in Q4, excluding artist services, and recorded music, and performance on music publishing, that's just meant to be represent math. In two of the areas that were most affected by COVID, if you pull them out that the rest of the business is still showing 9%, close to double-digit growth. But to clarify your point, you're right.

So there's significant upside, still within the areas covered in the 9%. But we just wanted to give we'll call it a simple algebraic metric so you could see how much if you pull out two of the most impacted areas are the underlying business was growing, but you're right, there's ups. And then the second piece was on the '21 weighting towards the second half of the year. That is right. We are saying that the full year our internal expectations at the time of the IPO for the full year, is what we are still targeting and we believe it is something that we can strive for. But that based on timing of revenue streams, which are impacted by COVID, and timing of our release schedule, that our business will be somewhat more second half weighted correct. Thank you, Matt. Steve, did you want to make closing comments Steve?"

            "name": "Stephen Cooper",
            "content": "Thanks, Kareem. Good morning, everyone, and thanks so much for joining us today. Looking back on the past year, despite the impact of the pandemic on our business, we're proud of everything we've accomplished. We've kept music fans engaged and excited with the flow of really great new releases and we've seen a marked acceleration in early-stage revenue streams such as social media, gaming, fitness and live streaming. Although effective vaccines may be on the horizon, companies across many different industries are still expecting a prolonged road to recovery. Against that backdrop, we're very fortunate to be in a global business creating something so vital to peoples' lives all over the world. And music, unlike other forms of entertainment, can be enjoyed wherever you are and whatever you are doing. With that in mind, I'd like to turn to our performance in the fourth quarter. While digital revenue grew 15% year-over-year, our total revenue was down 1%. Digital revenue growth was offset by steep declines in the areas of our business that are most aligned with touring and live appearances and therefore most disrupted by COVID. Specifically, those areas are artist's services and expanded-rights in recorded music and performance in music publishing. Excluding revenue from those areas, our growth in Q4 would have been approximately 9%, which clearly demonstrates the ongoing strength at the core of our business. Adjusted EBITDA was up by approximately 33% year-over-year. This highlights the operating leverage in our business, driven by the continuing shift from physical to digital, as well as our focus on operating cost discipline. Our recorded music revenue was down by about 1% is double-digit growth in digital, was offset by a 45% decline in artist services and expanded-rights revenue. As always, our primary focus is on creating and delivering a constant ever-growing flow of great new music. This quarter, Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion's WAP became the first female rap collaboration in history to debut at #1 on the Billboard Top-100. There was also an impressive diversity of releases across genres from country's Brett Eldredge to pop's Charlie Puth, to rap's Saweetie. On the international front, artists who topped the charts included Germany's Amigos and Kontra K, France's Aya Nakamura and Brazil's Anitta, whose Me Gusta had more than 140 million streams in just two months. Japan's Aimyon and Twice enjoyed huge successes helping drive our physical revenue from a decline earlier in the fiscal year to essentially flat in Q4. Our top selling artists for the fiscal year also showcased the power and range of our roster. From breakout sensations, Roddy Ricch and Tones and I, to new global icons, Dua Lipa and Lizzo, to megastar Ed Sheeran. Despite a solid overall year, revenue from our music publishing business declined about 3% in the quarter. More importantly, [Technical Difficulty] digital revenue in music publishing continued to be strong growing almost 30% year-over-year. This impressive jump was offset by declines in performance, where revenue was lost from the closing of bars, restaurants, clubs and concerts. Mechanical and sync were also down. That being said, sync has shown some recovery since fiscal Q3 with a gradual resumption of television and film production. Warner Chappell continued its creative revitalization as its writers contributed to 18 #1 albums on the Billboard 200 Chart during fiscal 2020. This included Pop Smoke's posthumous release Shoot for the Stars, Aim for the Moon. As the result of our aggressive global signing campaign, we attracted a growing number of world-class songwriters, including country star Thomas Rhett; iconic Mexican Group, Bronco; and the legendary Quincy Jones. The company also renewed its deals with a number of its global superstars, including Spain's Pablo Albora\u0301n, Germany's Capital Bra and Sweden's Miss Li. Since our acquisition by Access in 2011, we've continued to evolve from an Anglo-American company into a global music entertainment enterprise. Today, our hits can come from anywhere and resonate everywhere. Our business now spans over 70 countries, and during COVID, we added to our global reach. Earlier this year, we opened new offices in Vietnam, India and Turkey, while Warner Chappell opened in Shanghai to capitalize on the exploding Chinese entertainment market. ADA, our independent label services division, expanded into Asia and Latin America. In addition, we forged innovative partnerships with Punjabi music specialist, Ziiki Media in India and with Africori, the largest music distributor in sub-Saharan Africa. If there has been a silver lining to the COVID cloud, it's been an opportunity to recalibrate our long view, accelerate the pace of change, and position ourselves to emerge from the pandemic stronger than ever. COVID has reinforced the importance of technology across every aspect of our business, from how we sign talent to how we market music and how we pay royalties. It's made us more agile, more efficient, and more precise. Just two quick examples. Since January, on a year-over-year basis, we doubled the number of new artists and songwriter signings identified through our proprietary A&R app, Sodatone. In the same timeframe, we've doubled the number of songwriters and tripled the number of recording artists using our royalty portals. Music is being woven into every aspect of our daily lives and we have the unique intellectual property that countless emerging platforms need. We are standing on the threshold of a new golden age of music and the opportunities are everywhere. As a result, we see subscription streaming as just the beginning. It is only one of our many avenues for long-term growth. With this in mind, we wanted to give you a look at what's on our horizon. First, the worlds of social media, gaming, and live streaming. With an expanding number of partnerships, including Facebook, TikTok and Snap, among others, social media is already a meaningful nine-figure revenue stream and is growing at a rate faster than subscription streaming. Billions of people are able to create the soundtrack of their lives. The creators are the audience and the audience are the creators, producing a massive multiplier effect. Artists and songwriters of all genres and generations, have the potential to go global at any moment. Thanks to a recent viral video, Fleetwood Mac's Dreams returned to Billboard's Top 10 more than 40 years after it was first released. COVID has supercharge the demand for 2D and 3D live streaming events and we successfully facilitated virtual concerts on platforms like WaveXR, Roblox and Fortnite. These platforms enable our artists to engage with audiences through an interactive immersive content that defies real-world limitations. Around these experiences we're also offering digital goods such as in game avatars. On track to be a several hundred-billion-dollar market by 2025, gaming is among the fastest growing sectors of digital media and we've positioned ourselves to forge meaningful partnerships within the gaming community. Second, we've expanded our involvement in other forms of entertainment content, like TV and podcasting. Especially with the rise of OTT, the demand for music driven programming, both audio and video, is rapidly increasing. WMG currently produces dozens of podcasts and we've already had some successes such as Digging Deep with Robert Plant. In 2017 we launched a dedicated film and TV division, Warner Music Entertainment. This group has been delivering a slate of fantastic projects such as Spike Lee's acclaimed film and David Byrne's American Utopia. We recently announced a major partnership with Imagine Entertainment, the production company behind movies like 8 Mile and TV shows like Empire. Third, we've created a growing network of owned and operated direct-to-consumer destinations. This makes us unique among the major music companies. We acquired social publishing platform, IMGN and music news site HipHopDX this year. They joined UPROXX, EMP and Songkick, as ways for us to gain early insight in the cultural trends and fan behavior. Our global e-tailer operations have adapted quickly to the new reality of the marketplace. For example, EMP, our European digital merchandiser launched and array of new products including a Stay-At-Home collection. And since the beginning of the pandemic, they have sold nearly half a million branded facemasks. Year-over-year their user base was up 10% and it is showing accelerating growth so far in the current fiscal year. Fourth, we're seeing explosive activity in the in-home fitness arena most notably through physical products like Peloton and Mirror, but also through virtual reality experiences like Supernatural and Oculus. According to Statista, the global fitness subscription market is already more than $23 billion. These services are still at low market penetration, but they are fueled by music and there's enormous potential for future growth. I also wanted to give you an update on our diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. Maurice Stinnett arrived in August to lead our efforts in this space, working with our teams around the world. These teams include our executive diversity and inclusion council, the employee resource groups and senior leadership. At the same time, the $100 million Warner Music Group, the Blavatnik Family Foundation's Social Justice Fund has gained momentum. The fund is making disbursements to organizations that are doing amazing work on the frontlines of anti-racism, community transformation, musicians' support and prisoners' rights. I also want to note that CC Kurtzman became the newest member of WMG's Board of Directors on October, 1. CC brings valuable independent expertise and perspective to the Board. In line with best practices in corporate governance all the members of the Board with the exception of myself are now external. Finally, as we look at 2021, we're expecting that our release schedule will be backend weighted with highly anticipated music from some of our global superstars. In this increasingly complex environment, we're the vital connective tissue between artists, fans and services. This gives our artists, songwriters and us the power to entertainment the world, shape the course of culture, and satisfy the essential human need for connection and solace. And now, over to Eric. Okay. Hey, Ben, good morning, and happy holidays. So, first of all, we do think this is good news that Spotify is beginning to take more seriously upward bound pricing and the news that they're going to be testing in a number of countries was well received at least by us. I think that as subscription strength grows and as these services offer more verticals, that it is likely that we continue to see across a number of the more substantial players exercising their ability to raise prices. I'm sure you know, when Amazon added their high def tier, they raised the prices there. I think the other services, given that Spotify is essentially a pure play, we'll look at this as an opportunity to also test the market and follow along. I don't see any massive shift of subscribers from Spotify to other services. They obviously have created their playlists. They have their routines on Spotify. And as we said during the IPO, ultimately, the value of the years has to begin to catch up with the value of the eyeballs. I think this is a start. I'm very hopeful that it will be a successful start and I believe this will give the other services the opportunity to follow. Sure. Go ahead, Eric, and then I'll chime in if there's anything I could add. Heath, I would just supplement that with a thought, particularly with TikTok. When you look at this service, the creators are the audience and the audiences are the creators. And the way the TikTok users are utilizing that service, from at least our perspective, increases the ability of music to go viral. And it goes viral because for these users, it's not a social platform it's a game where we're the creators trying to track their fellow creators and vice versa. And the utilization of music, the utilization of these contests, these dares, not all of them safe at times, has just produced from our perspective a tremendous multiplier effect by way of utilization, and we see that continuing for the foreseeable future. Thanks, Heath. Okay, thanks, Brian for the questions. So, first of all, with respect to publishing assets, artist relations, so on and so forth, in our latest acquisition, we were approached by our artist and the artists wanted to sell part of his rights and we were able in a very cordial way to work out a deal that he or she was very happy with and we were very happy with. We do not typically sell rights. We are more often than not, and acquired rights, but we are very, very, very sensitive to how our artists feel about those transactions. Frankly, we have turned down transactions where the artist was not happy, where the artist was not inclined to be supportive, because we are in the business on both sides of our businesses, long-term artist development. So we're -- when we look at the Taylor Swift, the ongoing back and forth between Taylor and Braun, and Taylor and Shamrock, those are types of situations that we look to avoid. One of the reasons that we do these transactions, and one of the reasons that we're in the publishing business is that we have a platform that can not only administrate copyrights, but a platform and an organization that can amplify their success Brian. We have -- we are a full service shop. So once rights are acquired, we go to work on syncs, we go to work, inviting these writers into writing camps, we go to work trying to match songs to artists that we know we're looking for, new product, new sounds, innovative tunes and lyrics. And our business is to work with our artists and those copyrights to create more momentum and more success by being proactive and not letting them sit in a vault for the next 5,10 or 15 years. What we see with other investments coming into the market where substantial capital is put against these investments, those organizations are investment organizations. And, frankly, it looks to me like it's a fixed income arbitrage play, as opposed to how do we work with the artists in these copyrights to ensure that we are doing everything we can proactively to optimize the results of their songwriting efforts. So we're in a different business. We're operators that work with our artists on investments. We're not an investment house, that's looking to arbitrage fixed income Brian. So, Eric, why don't I start and then you can add in anything you want. So I think there are actually two ways that we're looking at this Rich. One is the point you touched on, which is, obviously, when people are utilizing our music or anyone else's music, we believe that should be licensed. So in many respects, you're right, this looks like the early days of YouTube. But we and the gaming world are not much better organized than they were 15 or 20 years ago. So, fact of the matter is, Twitch is talking to the industry about licensing the music and obviously based upon the use cases that license will be narrow, it will be broad it will be on terms and conditions that support the use cases and support the growth of those use cases. So that's one avenue. The second avenue that we see as being as or more productive, are partnering with gaming companies. So that inside of the immersive worlds they're creating, Warner Music has the right sort of beachfront properties, sort to speak, where we are inside of those games, within conjunction with our artists or artists avatars, are providing entertainment, are holding concerts are bringing people to the Warner Music arena for other events. It's an opportunity to sell virtual goods. It's an opportunity to sell real world goods. And it's an opportunity to create a broader Canvas for our artists to paint on. So we are looking this, we're looking at gaming as a multidimensional opportunity for Warner Music and for our artists in the years ahead. Eric, you may want to add to that. Well, fingers crossed that you will, because these games and these gaming worlds have to continue to expand their offerings to continue to attract and hold at the players in their games and their universe so to speak Rich. So just like we can't stay static, they can't stay static. And partnering with people like Warner Music gives them an opportunity to bring some of the world's greatest music, some of the world's greatest artists into their main events, which is good for them and good for us because these type of events attract millions upon millions of gamers and they add flavor to the game, that would be absent without music and our artists. So the answer is yes, in the future you should expect to see more of our participation in the gaming world and participating in a way that we create value for artists. We create value for the game, for the game companies and we create value for Warner Music. So Eric, I'll take the kind of the global and the marketing and you can take the couple in between. Thanks for your questions, Jessica. Our ambition is, we've said historically, music is the only universal language on the planet and our ambition is to be able to be speaking that music in every language on the planet. As we mentioned during our IPO process, we have expanded tremendously over the last seven or eight years, our global footprint and it was an intentional expansion to turn this from an Anglo-centric to a truly global music entertainment company. That expansion is going to continue. We are constantly looking at opportunities outside of, well, we're looking at opportunities inside the U.S. inside the U.K., but also in the rest of the world, because when you look at streaming or you look at gaming, or you look at TikTok, they are global enterprises and the people that utilize them are an army of global citizens. We want to be in that same place where we are global and we are an army of music content deliverers to people around the world that are looking not only for music in English, but music in their local languages. And one of the reasons we are so intent upon this expansion is that typically more than 50% of the music listened to in any local area is the local music. So that while Anglo music travels well globally, and is a powerful mover of culture, at the local level, the predominant form of music is local music. And therefore, you've got to be better, because we are global and we want to be able to speak music in all of the languages of the globe. On the Spotify question, we look at and we evaluate marketing tools all the time to the extent where we find tools that we believe for the cost, provide an adequate rate of return, we will experiment with them, experiment with them, experiment with them and if they work, we will continue. If we find that the cold is worse than the cure, sort to speak, or the cure is worse than the cold, I guess, is the way that phrase goes, we move on to other tools that provide us with better results and better rates of return. So we have views. We are experimenting with the Spotify Marquee, but it remains to be seen how valuable a tool that will be. And with that, I'll turn it over to -- and hopefully that answered your question Jessica and I'll turn it over to Eric now. Great, so just to be crystal clear Matt, we see live in a couple of ways. First of all, we think there's a very reasonable probability that this last 7, 8, 9 months and the continuing COVID assault has begun and has changed a number of people's habits. So when we talk about live and we talk about touring, our intent is to continue to invest in live streaming, live concerts, VR concerts, and continue to support not only new habits, but the marketplace for this sort of entertainment at home. Because we believe at least, even with the announcement of the vaccines, the distribution is going to be very difficult for the foreseeable future. And we think that there is going to be an ongoing market for live streaming, for VR concerts, so on and so forth. When it comes to live touring per se, based upon the success of any of these potential vaccines, and the way people are thinking at that point in time, will determine how successful the return to live is. My own personal view is that there are going to be, there's going to be some change of thinking about packing yourself into stadiums or arenas. I think there's some concern about returning to a mass for this society and I'm not smart enough to know how all of this is going to play out. But what I do believe is that the new normal, whether it's the summer, whether it's later in \u201821, or it's differed to \u201822, the new normal is going to look different than the old normal that we were all used to in 2017, 2018, and 2019. How it plays out, I think is highly uncertain. But what I do know, as people's habits are changing, our intent is to identify these trends, and ensure that whichever way the wind blows, we are there to support them with our music and our artists, that much I do know. Go ahead. Sure. I want to get this very brief. Just thanks everyone for taking the time out of what I'm sure you're busy schedules to join us today and I hope that everyone has a safe and a wonderful Thanksgiving and I hope that we all stay not only safe, but sane. So, we'll talk to you in a few months. Thanks, everybody and happy holidays."

At the request of Warner Music Group, today\u2019s call is being recorded for replay purposes. And if you object, you may disconnect at any time. As a reminder there will be a question-and-answer session following today\u2019s presentation. [Operator Instructions] Now, I would like to turn today\u2019s call over to your host, Mr. James Steven, Executive Vice President and Chief Communications Officer. You may begin.\nJames Steven: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Warner Music Group\u2019s fiscal third quarter ended June 30, 2020, conference call.

Also, please note that all revenue figures and comparisons discussed today will be presented in constant currency, unless otherwise noted. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Steve.\nSteve Cooper: Thanks, James. Good morning. First, I want to extend to everyone listening today a very warm welcome to our first earnings call as a publicly traded company. I also want to thank everyone who participated in our IPO process, making it a resounding success. And whether you\u2019ve followed us for years or you\u2019re just now getting up to speed, we\u2019re very pleased to be speaking with you today. We\u2019re holding this call during an extraordinary period of challenging change for both our country and our planet. We continue to grapple with global pandemic while, at the same time, we\u2019re at a critical moment of reckoning with systemic inequities. I\u2019ll speak more about these issues in a minute. But for anyone who\u2019s new to these calls, we thought it would be a good idea to give some background on what makes WMG unique. To begin, we\u2019re the only pure-play global music entertainment company on the planet. Warner Music is made up of 3 primary units: our Recorded Music and Music Publishing businesses and our corporate function. But we\u2019re driven by a one company and a one team philosophy, which helps maximize the value of all our rights and all of our assets. It\u2019s our distinctive combination of scale and nimbleness, creative innovation and financial discipline that gives us our competitive edge. We believe in investing in artist development and backing bold entrepreneurship. We don\u2019t believe in buying market share at a loss. Equally, we don\u2019t judge ourselves on a quarterly cycle, but rather by how we consistently perform on an annual basis. In short, we play the long game. On the Recorded Music side, our world-renowned record labels include Atlantic, Warner, Elektra and Parlophone. Our artist roster spans every musical genre led by superstars like Cardi B, Coldplay, Dua Lipa, Bruno Mars and Ed Sheeran. At the same time, our rich catalog includes legends such as David Bowie, The Doors, Fleetwood Mac, Aretha Franklin and Prince. As the role of the record label has evolved, we\u2019ve expanded our suite of groundbreaking artists and label services. These include ADA, which supports independent labels such as BMG and 12 Tone; a merchandise and e-commerce business with clients that include non-Warner artists such as Jennifer Lopez and Shawn Mendes; and a network of wholly owned consumer brands, including UPROXX, the influential youth website; Songkick, the live music app; and EMP, the merchandise e-tailer. Warner Chappell, our music publishing arm, has a history dating back more than 200 years. We currently represent 80,000 songwriters and 1.4 million-plus copyrights around the world from the standards of the great American songbook to the biggest hits of the 21st century, from George Gershwin to George Michael, from Led Zeppelin to Lizzo. Since Access Industries acquired Warner in 2011, we\u2019ve transformed ourselves from an Anglo-centric company into a global music enterprise in more than 70 countries. We\u2019ve embraced new technology, becoming the first major music company to strike deals with tech players such as Tencent and Snap. We were also the first to generate more than 50% of our Recorded Music revenue from streaming. And we\u2019ve invested in a suite of proprietary tools such as our marketing dashboard Opus and our A&R app, Sodatone. With that, let\u2019s get to the numbers. This was our first quarter during which COVID was a factor from beginning to end. During Q3, total revenue was down 3.1%. Digital revenue was up 13.4%. Adjusted EBITDA was up 18.9%, and adjusted OIBDA was up 12.2%. Eric will go into more detail shortly. We\u2019re very pleased with these results. They highlight the underlying strength and resilience of our business. Our most important metrics remain healthy: streaming growth is strong and our digital transformation continues. Digital revenue was more than 70% of our total revenue on an as-reported basis, and our largest source of revenue streaming was largely unaffected by COVID with Recorded Music jumping 11%. Our results echo encouraging signs across the industry with Nielsen reporting a double-digit consumption increase for on-demand audio streaming in the U.S. from mid-March through early July. We\u2019re also seeing increased competition in the streaming arena from newer entrants such as Facebook and Snap. As we said last quarter, some of our revenue streams, including physical sales, artist services and sync, have been affected by the pandemic. We expect that, for the most part, these revenue streams will recover over time as businesses reopen and economies begin to normalize. Physical is the only one of these revenue streams that was consistently decreasing pre-COVID, and in recent months, that decline has accelerated. In Recorded Music, physical revenue fell nearly 46% in the quarter. In Music Publishing, mechanical revenue from physical sales was down almost 43%. As the pandemic continues, especially as we\u2019re seeing new spikes in some countries, companies across many different industries are expecting a prolonged period of economic disruption. Against that backdrop, we\u2019re very, very fortunate to be in a sector that creates something so vital to people\u2019s lives. During this quarter, our team and our company were pressure tested, and we\u2019re more confident than ever about our long-term future. While we certainly won\u2019t become complacent, it\u2019s clear our formula is working. We\u2019re seeing success with a broad diversity of artists across genres, geographies and generations. We\u2019re especially proud of our ability to attract original talent often early in their careers and develop them into global superstars. Our commitment to new artist development is illustrated by the fact that 4 out of our top 5 best sellers this quarter were from artists releasing either debut or sophomore albums: Dua Lipa, Lil Uzi Vert, Roddy Ricch and Tones And I. In the U.S., Nielsen\u2019s 2020 midyear report again proved our ability to have massive hits with artists at every stage of their careers. This included Roddy Ricch\u2019s hit single, The Box, which is the most streamed song of 2020 and the only track with 1 billion streams in the U.S. alone. We also had 3 of the top 10 artists by total consumption as well as the number 1 and number 2 biggest pop songs during the first half of the calendar year. Our strength across multiple genres has been a real advantage during COVID. For example, Nielsen reported that country music experienced a significant surge in streaming during the quarter. And we\u2019ve been at the forefront of the genre with Kenny Chesney hitting number 1 on the U.S. album chart and 2 new artists, Gabby Barrett and Ingrid Andress, both topping the country charts with breakthrough releases. We\u2019ve continued to have strong momentum internationally as well. In April, Warner Music Russia had nine of the top ten tracks on the local Apple music chart, including Egor Kreed at number one. Italy scored number ones on 4 separate charts with Ghali, Pink Floyd and Achille Lauro, France had top-charting hits with Da Uzi and Ninho and Spain hit number with Fred De Palma. We\u2019re also very pleased to say that we kicked off Q4 with successful new releases from country star Brett Eldredge; Dutch rapper, Boef; Brazil\u2019s Anitta; the UK\u2019s Tinie Tempah and the U.S.\u2019 Charlie Puth and Saweetie, among others. Revenue from our Music Publishing business remains very strong, with global digital revenue up 41% in Q3. During the quarter, Warner Chappell songwriters contributed to a remarkable 13 songs that hit number one across the Billboard charts, including The Weeknd\u2019s massive hit Blinding Lights, co-written by Canada\u2019s Belly and Sweden\u2019s Oscar Holter. Other chart-topping songwriters included the U.S.\u2019 Yeti Beats, the UK\u2019s Liam Gallagher, Brazil\u2019s [indiscernible], the Netherlands Shirak, Italy\u2019s Tedua and Spain\u2019s C. Tangana. As I mentioned, one of our core strengths is to keep up a strong ever-growing flow of new music. During COVID, we\u2019re unavoidably experiencing some shifts in our release plans due to changes in recording and songwriting schedules. To counteract that, we\u2019ve prioritized signing new talent while giving our artists and songwriters the tools and environment they need to create and collaborate. We have dozens of in-house studios around the world, which have become safe havens for artists to work during the crisis. And where that\u2019s not possible, we\u2019re finding inventive workarounds. By way of example, Warner Music Mexico shipped home recording kits to many of its artists. To support our songwriters and producers, Warner Chappell has run more than ten virtual songwriting camps since March so that they can continue to make music and stay connected globally. And Recorded Music hosted a very successful global sync showcase with acclaimed artist, Lianne La Havas, bringing her music to commercial partners all over the world. Meanwhile, Warner Chappell continued its creative revitalization with an aggressive global signing campaign. Among the world-class songwriters to join the company in Q3 were country star Thomas Rhett, iconic Mexican group Bronco, and the late rapper, Pop Smoke, whose posthumous album debuted at #1 on the U.S. album chart. Warner Chappell also renewed its deals with a number of its global superstars, including Spain\u2019s Pablo Alboran, Germany\u2019s Capital Bra and Sweden\u2019s Miss Li. Since our acquisition by Access in 2011, Warner Music has become a worldwide platform where our artists and their music can come from anywhere and resonate everywhere. As I said earlier, we\u2019re now in over 70 countries, and even during COVID, we\u2019ve continued to expand our global reach. Earlier this year, Recorded Music opened new offices in Vietnam, India and Turkey, while Warner Chappell opened in Shanghai to capitalize on the exploding Chinese market. We\u2019ve forged new innovative partnerships with Punjabi specialist, Ziiki Media in India and with Africori, the largest music distributor in sub-Saharan Africa. More than ever, we\u2019re seeing the value that major music companies bring to the entire music ecosystem, cutting through the noise and deepening the connections between artists and fans across the globe. The COVID-induced absence of live concerts has crystallized our value to creative talent like never before. We\u2019re helping our artists and songwriters take more risks and be more adventurous than ever as they look for new ways to connect with fans in a world of social distancing. A key element driving this connection over the past few months has been the growing world of live streams and virtual events. A few highlights include David Guetta\u2019s United At Home livestream benefit, which had 12 million viewers; an innovative paid admission virtual concert with the rock band Trivium, which also led to a spike in merch sales; and hugely successful events in Finland, France, Spain and elsewhere around the globe. We\u2019ve always believed that music is a force for good in the world, and that our artists, songwriters and our team can have a powerful influence in bringing about changes that we all want to see. Recent horrific events have made it clear that concrete actions must be taken to combat all forms of social injustice, and at the same time, champion diversity and inclusion. In June, we announced that the Warner Music Group and the Blavatnik Family Foundation were establishing a $100 million fund to support social justice education, the music ecosystem and campaigns against violence and racism. Recently, we announced the 15 members of the fund\u2019s Board of Directors, including highly accomplished people such as Mona Sutphen, the former White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy under President Obama; and Paul Henderson of the San Francisco Department of Police Accountability. Yesterday, we announced the appointment of a dedicated Head of Global Equity, Diversity and Inclusion, Dr. Maurice Stinnett, a well-known leader in the field. We\u2019ve also established an Executive Diversity & Inclusion Council, which will further unite our core values with our business objectives. We will continue to mount a concerted sustained drive to effect real change in our company, our industry and our society. Let me conclude by saying I\u2019m incredibly proud of how endlessly adaptive, creative and solution-driven our teams, artists and songwriters across the globe have been during this unprecedented time. Music is central to the lives of every person on this planet. We remain perfectly positioned to satisfy the essential human need for entertainment, solace and connection. And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Eric.\nEric Levin: Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. As Steve said, total revenue was down 3.1% in constant currency. On an as-reported basis, it was down 4.5%. I\u2019ll break this out in detail in a moment, but the key takeaway is that these results are slightly better than our expectations given the unsurprising impact that COVID had on certain aspects of our business. A big part of this is that streaming revenue continues to show double-digit increases. We remain confident that we\u2019re well positioned for long-term growth. From an OIBDA perspective, certain adjustments are necessary to make the year-over-year comparisons more meaningful. The details are in our press release. But in the quarter, we had a charge of $440 million associated with noncash stock-based compensation under our long-term incentive plan, reflecting changes in the value of our common stock as a result of our IPO. This compares to $14 million of noncash stock-based compensation expense in the prior year quarter. We also had $86 million of IPO-related costs and $11 million of expenses related to restructuring and other transformation costs. Going forward, the long-term incentive plan awards will be accounted for as equity, and as such, will not be adjusted for fluctuations in trading value of our common stock. However, we will continue to have stock-based compensation charges for any unvested awards in the plan and for any future awards that may be issued under new clients. From this quarter on, noncash stock-based compensation expense will be excluded from adjusted OIBDA. We believe this provides a more accurate view of how we manage our business. Q3 adjusted OIBDA increased 12% to $166 million due to lower overall costs from COVID-related business disruption and active cost management. Adjusted OIBDA margin increased 2.4 percentage points to 16.4% primarily driven by revenue mix, with a decrease in lower-margin physical and artist services and expanded rights revenue and an increase in higher-margin streaming revenue as well as lower operating costs. In Recorded Music, third quarter revenue was down 4.2%. Digital revenue grew 10% with an 11% increase in streaming revenue. Licensing revenue declined 26% due to lower advertising spend and deal activity resulting from COVID disruption. Physical revenue declined 46% with lower physical sales due to the impact of COVID and the continued shift to stream. Artist services and expanded-rights revenue, which includes merchandising, declined 21% driven by timing of tour schedules as well as COVID-related tour postponements and cancellations and decreased merchandise revenue. Recorded Music adjusted OIBDA increased 14% to $167 million due to overall cost savings and revenue mix. Adjusted OIBDA margin increased 3.4 percentage points to 19.4%. Music Publishing grew its revenue by 3% in Q3. Digital revenue rose 41% due to increases in streaming revenue and timing of digital deals. Mechanicals declined 43% due to continued market decline in physical and the impact of COVID. Sync declined 24%, and performance revenue declined 21% due to COVID-related business disruption. Music Publishing adjusted OIBDA declined 6% or $2 million to $34 million. Adjusted OIBDA margin declined 1.7 percentage points to 22.8% due to revenue mix. Our operating cash flow in Q3 was $123 million versus $150 million in the prior year quarter. The change was largely due to timing of working capital, including royalty payments. CapEx was $20 million compared to $23 million in the prior year quarter. For the full year 2020, we expect the total to be about $80 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $189 million compared to $159 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was largely due to the same factors impacting adjusted OIBDA in addition to higher pro forma savings expected to be realized from certain transformational initiatives. We did not declare or pay a dividend in the quarter as we shift to our new dividend policy. In connection with our IPO, we amended our dividend policy and now intend to pay quarterly cash dividends of $0.12 per share to holders of our common stock. We expect to pay the first dividend under this policy in September 2020. When we reported our Q2 results in early May, we were less than two months into the worsening impact of COVID in most major markets. Since then, we\u2019ve taken a number of additional steps to protect our business, continuing to adjust spend and allocate our capital in the most prudent and impactful way. Even if the pandemic continues longer than originally expected, we have all the resources and resilience needed to weather this storm. We\u2019ll come out of this \u2013 out the other side with our long-term prospects as strong as ever. As of June 30, we had a cash balance of $532 million. Just after our quarter end, we completed the issuance of $535 million of 3 7/8% senior secured notes and EUR 325 million of 2 3/4% senior secured notes. The proceeds of these issuances have been used to refinance all of our 4 1/8%, 4 7/8% and 5% senior secured notes. The effect of this transaction has reduced our weighted average cost of debt from 4% at June 30, 2020, to 3.6%, resulting in $9 million of annual interest savings. We\u2019ve all learned much during these extraordinary times about our business and our people. We\u2019ve learned that our biggest source of revenue, streaming, is hugely resilient with music subscriptions continuing to grow in the midst of a global lockdown. Perhaps more importantly, we\u2019ve learned that our teams, our artists and our songwriters have an incredible ability to pivot and adapt, to keep the company running and the music flowing. With that, operator, please open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nBen Swinburne: Hey, good morning, guys. I wanted to ask two questions. Steve, you mentioned in your prepared remarks the fact that there\u2019s no touring, which obviously is just an enormous part of artists\u2019 income. How is that impacting your business, your artists, both positively and negatively? I think you talked about it crystallizing your value, but obviously, it may also be impacting release schedules. Just could you talk a little bit more about the fact that not only is there no touring today, but the outlook is pretty unclear? And how we should think about that impacting your business? And then I just had one follow-up for Eric.\nSteve Cooper: Sure, and good morning, nice to chat with you. Well, live has obviously been negatively impacted by the pandemic. But it is provided for us the opportunity to pivot far more quickly into live streaming and virtual concerts. We have been experimenting with it for some time, but we have now taken meaningful additional steps to support our artists and to support their loss of live revenue with this digital reinterpretation of live. So it has hastened our move into the live streaming world. It\u2019s hastened our move into the virtual concert world. And I would expect that in the future, our activity in those areas are going to expand. So that\u2019s one positive. Another positive that we have found is that with the shutdown of live, it\u2019s become more important for our artists and for us to have consistent engagement with their fan base, both by way of their existing music, but as importantly, producing new music. And we\u2019ve seen with many of our artists around the globe an uptick in the output of new music, both from our established and new artists, and that\u2019s been good news. The downside is that, obviously, there are certain operations that require our people to be in either our video studios or other\u2019s video studios and that\u2019s been a bit difficult. But slowly but surely, we see that returning. And hopefully, over the next few months, given our network of studios, both recording and video and the protocols that we put in place to keep them safe and sound, that business will begin to normalize over the next 3, 6, 9, 12 months. So all in all, we have provided what I would call really a very safe harbor environment for artists where they can continue to work, to collaborate, to write songs, to produce music.\nBen Swinburne: Thanks, Steve. And Eric, just as we think about fiscal fourth quarter, is there a way for you to help us think about sort of the year-over-year trends we saw in Q3 and how they may translate into Q4? So trying to understand if COVID is sort of as is in the fourth quarter on your business as we saw in Q3? Or anything you can tell us about sort of the near-term trends? Thanks.\nEric Levin: I mean we \u2013 thanks, Ben. We don\u2019t give guidance, so it\u2019s hard for me to be very specific. We can certainly say that we\u2019re extremely kind of pleased that streaming continues, specifically subscription streaming continues its strong trends and strong double-digit growth on our business. Every market around the world is in a different stage of either recovery and opening or cautiousness around opening. So every market around the world\u2019s going to be on a different time frame. So we\u2019re continuing to monitor very closely each market. But what we can say is that we\u2019re working very diligently to maximize the performance of each of our businesses, each of our revenue streams in each market around the world, given market conditions. And we\u2019re managing costs to make sure we\u2019re spending where it will have the most impact. So I think that\u2019s directionally kind of what I can say there, Ben.\nBen Swinburne: Thanks, Eric. Thank you.\nEric Levin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nHeath Terry: Great, thanks. I hate to be a little repetitive, but I actually want to dig into the live events piece, too. But I kind of want to go in a bit of a different direction, more longer term. And Steve, really curious sort of how you\u2019re thinking about the opportunity. To the extent that your artists are going to be in this position of sort of reduced touring revenues for an extended period of time, given the investments that you\u2019ve made in technology platforms and in merchandising, how do you see the opportunity for Warner to do more in supporting what may be a much bigger, more robust online event environment? And potentially, whether that means investing far more significantly in technology platforms or marketing opportunities for your artists? Just really curious, somebody who\u2019s been in the industry for as long as you have, sort of how you potentially see that as a bigger, longer-term shift that maybe this pandemic is accelerating. And then, Eric, if you don\u2019t mind, just really curious if you could help us a bit with sort of the pace of streaming growth across the quarter. It sounds like from what you said that May and June growth was a bit slower than April. Curious if there\u2019s any sort of reason that you could share with us on that? And to the extent that there\u2019s anything that you can say about sort of how that\u2019s trended into July, that would also be really helpful.\nSteve Cooper: So why don\u2019t I go first? There is this old phrase that nature abhors a vacuum. And the loss of live because of the pandemic has created a vacuum. And I think that, that\u2019s a situation where we will do all that we can to begin to fill it. I think that people\u2019s habits change over time. I think the pandemic and the isolation has created changes in habits, changes in behavior. People are becoming more used to live streaming to virtual concerts and it\u2019s an area that I believe presents both a short, intermediate and long-term opportunity for us. And so my expectation is that our operators, with the support of corporate, will be doing more and more in those areas. And I expect it by way of what we offer our artists. I expect that those capabilities and our offerings to expand to fill that vacuum, Heath.\nEric Levin: Great. And I\u2019ll take the second question. So on the pace of streaming, Heath, it\u2019s really been quite stable. I mean we would describe Q3 as consistently double digits with \u2013 throughout the period, so quite stable. And then as we look forward, we continue to be extremely optimistic about the ongoing strength of streaming and its continuing capabilities, specifically of paid streaming, to continue its growth profile.\nHeath Terry: Great. Thank you, both.\nEric Levin: Thanks, Heath.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Russo with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nBrian Russo: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. One for Steve and then a follow-up for Eric. So for Steve, a question on music videos since Facebook has the \u2013 launched officially licensed music videos and so has Snapchat as you mentioned in your opening remarks. So we know that YouTube is sort of notorious for paying what I\u2019ll call below-market rates for their videos. What should we be assuming about the royalty rates for these other platforms? And do you see this as a revenue source that can potentially move the needle over the next several years? And then for Eric, just again, another follow-up on streaming. Curious in terms of, again, the near-term outlook. Is the launch of like Taylor Swift\u2019s new album something that we should expect to affect the growth rate of your streaming revenue? Any color there would be helpful. Thanks.\nSteve Cooper: Okay. Brian. So on the first point \u2013 sorry, I seem to have a frog in my throat this morning. On the first point, one of the things that we told our potential equity investors on our road show is we look to do two things: a, revenue diversification; and b, when we see new economic models emerging, to support those models and their growth in the short term by establishing both an operating and economic relationship with them that allows them better opportunities to boost their growth and by us taking that posture as they grow than sharing in their success differently as we renew our deals over time. Our expectation is that these alternate distribution paths, particularly the social platforms, will over time be significant revenue contributors to Warner music.\nBrian Russo: Understood.\nEric Levin: Great. And I\u2019ll take the second piece on the near-term outlook of streaming. Again, we don\u2019t give guidance, but we do kind of \u2013 I can kind of describe our philosophy, and philosophy is that we have a very broad portfolio of music and releases globally. And we target continued growth of our business regardless of release schedules. Thanks, Brian.\nBrian Russo: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Richard Greenfield with LightShed. Your line is now open.\nRichard Greenfield: Hi, thanks for taking the question. When you think about competition, I guess I\u2019d love your view because I think, Stephen, when you gave your opening, you talked about new competition from Facebook and Snapchat. And I sort of think of those very differently than I think about a Snapchat \u2013 sorry, about a Spotify or an Apple Music. I sort of think of that as they\u2019re licensing a different form of music. And when you think about sort of the core streaming service of those Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon, et cetera, could you just give us an update on sort of what\u2019s happening competitively across the world? Obviously, we see Spotify\u2019s results, but we don\u2019t really see the others. Could you give us a sense of what\u2019s happening with the other sort of competitors to Spotify and what you\u2019re seeing in various markets?\nSteve Cooper: Sure. I can\u2019t give you specifics, but what I can tell you is, broadly speaking, and Eric can give you more specifics, but broadly speaking, streaming continues to enjoy very robust growth, both in developed and in emerging markets. So that\u2019s number one. And there, I\u2019m talking about the traditional streamers: Spotify, Apple, YouTube, Amazon. We\u2019re also seeing that there are new competitors, as you indicated, coming into the market. These social platforms, even though they are \u2013 they serve a different purpose than a YouTube or a Spotify, but they have discovered that music is, as we\u2019ve always believed, relevant and important to virtually everybody on the planet and they are developing within their own ecospheres their own models for the utilization in music, and we expect that to continue, not only on social platforms, but when you look at other routes of distribution like fitness. You see it with Peloton. So we think that\u2019s great from both a competitive as well as a revenue diversification point of view. We think the growth both in \u2013 from traditional streaming as well as these new models will continue at a very nice pace for the foreseeable future. And we see in new emerging models that we haven\u2019t seen any substantial growth yet from and new ones popping up every day that music is more often than not becoming a foundational building block. So we continue not only to be excited about traditional streaming, these new large platforms sort of utilizing music, but also the future where new models emerge weekly, monthly that utilize music. So we continue to be very excited about our future.\nRichard Greenfield: So maybe just \u2013 that\u2019s very helpful. Could you just maybe give us some way of framing? I think for the quarter, you reported streaming revenue globally was up like 9%. That obviously includes both the dedicated streaming as well as the \u2013 these are social streamers, I guess, as you just called them. Is there any way to think about how much of that is driven by the core streamers versus the new sort of \u2013 the new avenues of monetization?\nSteve Cooper: Eric, can you take that?\nEric Levin: Yes. This is Eric. So our Reported Music streaming grew in constant currency 11%, which we think is a very good way to look at it. And I would say that the \u2013 what we\u2019ll call traditional streamers continue to be, by far, the largest proportion of our revenue. So for that level of double-digit growth requires the traditional streamers to have continued strong growth, which I would describe as supplemented by the emerging forms of streaming, which are, as Steve mentioned earlier, are expanding but are a smaller piece of the pie. So the opportunity for them to have that kind of significant impact is over the longer term as they get more and more scale.\nRichard Greenfield: That\u2019s extremely helpful. Thank you, Eric.\nEric Levin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America Securities. Your line is now open.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Good morning. Thank you. Universal Music \u2013 Universal\u2019s recent Spotify deal, let me put it that way, it just seems somewhat different than yours given the two-sided marketplace tools. Can you access similar terms and services for marketing data and analytics? And do you want to? And then also on kind of a second question. You\u2019ve talked a lot about how important global is for you, of course. Can you talk a little more deeply or can you drill a little deeper into which markets are showing the best growth? Obviously, this would be in streaming. But where do you think the greatest potential for upside still remains? And then finally, just can you touch on TikTok and how this \u2013 how important of a platform is this? How did the shutdown in India affect you and all of these potential outcomes in the U.S. like how important is it for you? And what would you like to say? Thank you.\nSteve Cooper: So let me first address Spotify, then I\u2019ll address growth in TikTok. We have experimented with Spotify tools, Marquee and other tools. And if we choose to utilize them, we can utilize them on the same basis as our substantial competitors. So we look at all of these tools, we look at marketing not as an expense, but as an investment. And so when we expend marketing dollars, we look at how and where and when we get the best return on investment. If we find that\u2019s a Spotify tool, we utilize it. If we find it\u2019s other approaches, we utilize them. What we don\u2019t do is utilize tools where we don\u2019t get sufficient return on investment, Jessica. So that\u2019s number one. Number two, we see robust growth for the foreseeable future coming from both the developed markets, North America, Western Europe and very robust growth from emerging markets. Obviously, the emerging markets have a different model because of however you measure it, their GDP, the per capita income, the number of people that are categorized as middle class, on and on and on. But what we do see is even with a more compacted economic model in those emerging markets, it has \u2013 streaming has had a meaningful reduction in piracy where we would get a 100% of zero. So the growth, the conversion of people, even if it\u2019s on the free side, is converting people out of piracy into something that ultimately allows them to convert into premium utilization. And that\u2019s good for the music industry and it\u2019s good for the streamers. With respect to TikTok, TikTok is a \u2013 it is not really a \u2013 it\u2019s not a social platform. It\u2019s an app where the creators are the audience, the audience are the creators. And what we find, it is a source of discovery, both by way of new music and A&R. So from that perspective, it\u2019s very important to us. Economically, it is much more in the start-up category. And because of the economics in India, it will not, in the short term, have a meaningful impact on our revenue. Hopefully, that answers your question.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Morris with Guggenheim. Your line is now open.\nMichael Morris: Thank you. Good morning. Two questions from me. The first one has to do with podcasting. The market, investors have had a lot of enthusiasm for some of the investment that Spotify, in particular has made in podcasting. I\u2019d love to hear your current thoughts on how growth in podcasting for Spotify impacts your economic relationship with them, both on the subscription side and your participation there and also on the advertising side, whether they are carving pieces of that out that they\u2019re keeping and not sharing with you. My second question is on margins and the opportunity for margin expansion, and specifically, how you are thinking about investment in A&R going forward, whether that\u2019s an area where you expect to get scale over time or whether it\u2019s something that the growth in investment would keep pace with your top line, and what the priorities are on the A&R side? Thank you.\nSteve Cooper: So I\u2019ll take the first, Michael, and Eric will take the second. So first of all, we\u2019re very happy that Spotify is investing in podcasting. It gives them an opportunity to create another vertical that they can create not only an ad-free service around, but presumably, over time, a premium service. I believe personally that there will be people that come to Spotify for a podcast and stay for music, and that there will be people that come to Spotify for music and stay for a podcast. It does not impact our economics, either on the free side or the subscription side. But hopefully, what it will do is create appeal to a broader audience. And if you remember your Venn diagrams, I\u2019m sure that there will be a overlap in those Venn diagrams that drive people from podcasting to music and music to podcasting. I also believe that, that being said, that Spotify\u2019s basic foundation stone or basic foundation will always be music, Michael. I don\u2019t see that changing anywhere near the foreseeable future. Hopefully, that\u2019s responsive to your question, and I\u2019ll turn it over to Eric on the other piece.\nEric Levin: On margins, you specifically asked about A&R, but I\u2019ll answer margins broadly but also touch on A&R. So one of our core strategies has been and continues to be to continue to invest organically in our own growth, and A&R is a cornerstone of that. So we continue to invest and broaden our releases of music around the world as an important cornerstone to continuing to grow our business in a growing marketplace, certainly over the long term. But margins in generally, we do see a formula and plan for expansion and that has twofold: one is as Recorded Music continues to shift from physical formats to streaming formats has a natural margin uplift; and two, we are very actively in cost management mode. To give a couple of examples, one is we\u2019re well underway with our global financial transformation where we\u2019re moving over the next two years at cloud-based SAP S/4HANA solution. And once that is live, we have plans to save $35 million to $40 million a year. We also have started, and we started last year, actually a transformation office, a dedicated transformation office reporting directly to Steve that\u2019s focused on looking at opportunities to drive efficiencies through technologies and other tools throughout the business. And we expect to start seeing opportunities to drive business benefits as well as cost savings starting in 2021 from that office. So margin expansion is important to us, but we continue to invest in A&R to help fuel our business growth. Thanks Michael.\nMichael Morris: Thank you both.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Thornton with [indiscernible] Securities. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, good morning everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe two quick ones if I could. I guess one for Steve. Do you see opportunity to leverage some of the DSP partners to drive just better growth in ticketing over time, whether that\u2019s for live events or streamed concerts as you kind of talked about earlier as well as merchandising and memorabilia? I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s opportunity to kind of leverage those partners to drive maybe accelerated growth in those verticals, which have been fairly stable for quite a long time. And then just, secondly, maybe one for Eric, on the cost rationalization programs. You talked about the financial systems one as well the other that I think was more back office and real estate that starts next year. Any change to just the absolute amounts you\u2019re targeting versus several months ago as well as just kind of the time line that you communicated a couple of months back? Just curious if we\u2019re on track there or any updates there. Thanks guys.\nSteve Cooper: Thanks for the questions, Matthew. So we\u2019re constantly looking at opportunities to better support our artist opportunities. So we look at, on a regular basis, the interfaces with any number of platforms and what we can do better by way of driving music, merch, ticketing, so on and so forth. We are \u2013 and we \u2013 as I said, we\u2019re in regular discussions with these platforms about how can we expand this, how can we be more productive doing that. So we do look at it. We do, in certain instances, see opportunities. In other instances, frankly, with our wholly owned sites or wholly owned apps, we find that we can create because of the focus on a specific mission with specific artists, oftentimes drive additional revenue better than these large DSPs. But yes, we\u2019re looking all the time.\nEric Levin: Great. And Matthew, on the question related to cost, I would say that we remain focused and managing to the same plans that we were related to both our financial transformation and our broader transformation office. I think it\u2019s worth noting that working remotely and being in the COVID-affected environment requires different ways to work on those initiatives, and in some cases, different ways of delivering those initiatives. But we\u2019ve made those adjustments and remain totally comfortable and committed in delivering the transformations that we\u2019ve been working diligently towards.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks guys. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Thank you. So I guess a couple. I mean, firstly, I think during the prepared remarks, I think one of the comments that was made was four out of five artists this quarter were \u2013 top-performing artists were those who released albums new or were new artists. Does that change \u2013 just from a margin perspective, does that help margins because you do recognize COGS upfront from that? And so how does that change the cadence, if at all, going forward? And secondly, your marketing cost, excluding SBC, seems to have come in lower. The SG&A costs, excluding SBC, seems to have come in lower largely because of lower marketing. Is that a cadence output? Or is there something that we can expect on a sustained basis going forward as well? Thanks.\nEric Levin: I can take that. So what I would say is I wouldn\u2019t look to four of the top five artists being new to uniquely have an effect on margin. We have a very broad and global portfolio and so it\u2019s really the portfolio of music that we\u2019re releasing, marketing, the mix that is going to affect margins. So the top five artists are meaningful, but we have such a deep, broad global array of artists that it\u2019s \u2013 that I would look \u2013 that we\u2019re going to \u2013 that you\u2019d have to look much deeper than that to really see a margin impact. So I wouldn\u2019t focus on the top five for margin purposes. On marketing, what I would say is on a ongoing basis, we\u2019ve had a pretty stable investment in marketing. It\u2019s been growing with revenue, and we would expect to continue to grow with revenue as we continue to drive more and more music into the marketplace over time that our marketing supports that. We have said that this quarter, and we will manage quarter-to-quarter in a COVID-affected world to make sure the spend that we\u2019re putting into the market is generating the appropriate return, and we\u2019ll adjust spend where appropriate. And that adjusting of spend will be across all attributes of spend. It will be across marketing. It will be across travel. It will be across infrastructure and overhead. And so I would just say that this quarter, we evaluated the appropriate level of spend to drive the revenue and make sure that we were managing costs yet still delivering the right marketing impact.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Okay, thank you.\nEric Levin: Thank you, Kannan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tim Nollen with Macquarie. Your line is now open.\nTim Nollen: Great, thanks very much. I just wonder \u2013 a couple of quick questions for Eric, please. If you could elucidate the difference between the U.S. and the international growth rates in the quarter? It looks like, if my numbers are right, international was only down a couple percent. U.S. was down much more like 7%. Just wondering why that is? And then I don\u2019t know if you provide this, but would it be possible to get an advertising-related revenue figure? I think Spotify\u2019s number was down about 20% for ad-supported revenues in its quarter. It would make sense that yours would be something similar. Is there any comment on that, please?\nEric Levin: Great. So I would just say that U.S. is impacted by areas such as physical and artist services, which affect the overall revenue growth trends. So those are some of the areas that declined related to COVID that had an impact and those are going to have a bit of a U.S. orientation in this quarter. We don\u2019t break out ad-supported streaming from subscription streaming. I would just say directionally that the trends were subscription streaming growth has continued to be robust and ad-supported streaming has been affected is appropriate to say. Clearly, businesses that are pulling back on their marketing budgets and not doing as much advertising affects ad-supported streaming, and that would flow through our numbers as well, but we don\u2019t release a specific percentage.\nTim Nollen: Yes, makes sense. Thank you.\nEric Levin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Belton with Evercore. Your line is now open.\nJohn Belton: Yes, thanks for the questions. Two quick ones. First, just kind of taking everything you\u2019ve just gone through on the margin side. When you look at margins reported by your peers, are there significant reporting differences and business mix differentials that maybe suggest it\u2019s not a great comparison? Or do you think ultimately, given all the transformation plans you have in the process, you could close the gap and generate margins similar to what your peers are reporting? And then, secondly, probably for Steve, on the M&A environment and the impact of COVID, how is the pandemic impact on what you\u2019re seeing on potential deals, potential publishing catalogs available for purchase? Any color there would be interesting. Thanks.\nEric Levin: So I\u2019ll take the margin one. So we\u2019re very comfortable with where our margins currently are relative to our peers, but we are very focused on expanding our margins from where we are. And we have outlined our kind of strategy, which includes the cost management of our infrastructure. I described our programs before, which will both allow us to generate cost savings, but also have more scalability with our infrastructure. And the continued shift from physical to streaming will also give us margin directionally ongoing and long-term margin improvement. So we\u2019re very comfortable with the direction of our margins, how we\u2019re managing it and our opportunities for upside.\nSteve Cooper: Great. And on the M&A part, John, we are seeing a lot of opportunities. And where we believe that we can execute a rational, financially and operationally disciplined deals, we move forward on them and we try and close. I will say this that the market is, looks to me, somewhere between crazy and really, really crazy. And we\u2019ve got a real cost of capital. So we continue to be very financially disciplined on one side and very disciplined when we look at these operations so that we know that they can be reasonably and thoughtfully integrated even as a stand-alone unit into the envelope under the Warner Music Group. But we are not allowing COVID to screw up our brains and make us lose our wraparound, which is financial discipline.\nJohn Belton: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet with Citi. Your line is now open.\nJason Bazinet: Just a quick question for Mr. Levin. If COVID didn\u2019t happen, how much better do you think your revenues would have been in the quarter?\nEric Levin: Really hard to answer hypotheticals, but I think we can kind of just look at it not numerically but structurally. And if you look just at Recorded Music first and you look at ad-supported streaming, which clearly was affected; you look at sync, which clearly was affected; you look at artist services, both merch and touring, which were dramatically affected; physical, which was declining, but the acceleration has declined. Although streaming is 70% of our revenue, our largest and fastest-growing source of revenue, these other areas other than physical were all businesses and revenue streams that were growing. So clearly, there\u2019d be a significant opportunity for growth as we were doing prior to COVID. On Publishing, you\u2019d have a similar dynamic. Performance was growing. Sync in Publishing grew in our fiscal first half of the year, 17% in Publishing. So the dynamics for growth prior to COVID and without COVID, obviously, were very strong and favorable. And over the past several years, we\u2019ve been having a double-digit revenue CAGR. So clearly, COVID has had a material impact. That said, we\u2019ve said, longer term, as you look \u2013 as COVID recedes in the future, we still feel very good about the long-term prospects and growth potential of our business. We don\u2019t really see that any of these areas have been affected \u2013 or that their long-term potential has been inhibited or affected by this.\nJason Bazinet: That\u2019s helpful. And if I can just ask one follow-up. When you said ad-supported was impacted, I always assumed that your revenues were a function of the hours streamed on ad-supported, not a function of the ad revenue that streaming service generates?\nEric Levin: Well, every deal is different. We don\u2019t comment on specific deals. But we certainly do have deals where we get a percentage of the ad revenue.\nJason Bazinet: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nTodd Juenger: Hi. Thanks. I know we\u2019re way over time here, so I\u2019ll keep it to one, probably for Eric. Kind of picking up Kannan\u2019s question. I\u2019d love if you would be so kind to help us understand a little better the unit economics on catalog or what\u2019s called catalog; however you define that, versus, I guess, what I\u2019ll call new releases. Anything you can tell us about sort of the margin profiles and differences amongst that and generally proportionately how your mix stands between catalog and new releases? And I\u2019m sorry, finally along that, one might believe catalog might be actually growing as a share in this current era of lack of new releases as much as normally, and that would maybe be good for margins. Is there anything you can do to support that and keep that growing for your benefit and those artists\u2019 benefits? Thanks.\nEric Levin: I would say that both catalog and new release have strong margin profiles and it\u2019s certainly true that new releases will, in some cases have advances. By the way, sometimes catalogs will as well. But so long as we\u2019re recouping those advances, and we generally recoup at high rates, the underlying economics of deals can be strong on both. So I would just make that point. The mix of new and catalog in streaming, certainly one of the things that we\u2019ve continued to say is that traditional catalog and shallow catalog have always made up the majority of streams, but that new releases are hugely important part of it and that new releases also create the shallow and eventually deep catalog of the future. So new releases are critical fuel that both grows the opportunity to grow market share in the short-term, but also continues to replenish the catalog in the longer term. And then, lastly, has COVID, which I think is what you\u2019re asking, affected the share of catalog? Certainly, it has, to some degree. It certainly affected listening patterns. People are listening; different communities are listening differently than they were before. There\u2019s less commuting, more home listening. So it\u2019s definitely different patterns. But I would also say we continue to \u2013 our artists continue to write, record and release music. And we continue to be very focused on driving new music into the market and maintaining that presence even through this COVID environment. So hopefully, that helps, Todd.\nTodd Juenger: It does. And I know I squeezed three into one, so sorry about that and thank for indulging. Thanks everybody.\nEric Levin: We appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Ivan Feinseth with Tigress Financial Partners. Your line is now open.\nIvan Feinseth: Thank you for taking my questions and congratulations on good performance in a difficult time. I guess my question is for Steve. Do you see an opportunity to like sign and develop podcast artists, I guess for lack of a better word?\nSteve Cooper: We are looking at the podcast ecosphere, and we currently, with a number of our recording artists, create podcasts. That being said, the economics of podcasting remain pretty opaque. And while we are prowling around that space, we haven\u2019t really found anything yet, Ivan that has really caught our eye.\nIvan Feinseth: Okay. Currently, there are people who just \u2013 I understand the podcast from like performers, which makes sense, but for people who obviously are just podcasters or have certain niches, there could be an opportunity. I just wanted your thoughts on that?\nSteve Cooper: Yes, there might be. We just \u2013 we keep looking at the economic model of podcasting to figure out whether or not there\u2019s something that makes sense for us to do and whether or not there\u2019s something that can really be done at scale. And we\u2019re going to continue to look at it. Obviously, we\u2019re in the content, the intellectual property and the artist business. And you\u2019re right, there may be opportunities. We just haven\u2019t seen the right ones yet, Ivan.\nIvan Feinseth: Okay. Thank you very much.\nSteve Cooper: You\u2019re more than welcome. Have a great day.\nOperator: That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Steve for closing remarks.\nSteve Cooper: Well, again, I want to thank everybody for joining us today. I want to welcome again our new shareholders. Hopefully, this has been an informative session, and we look forward to chatting with you again after our fourth quarter. So I hope everybody stays safe and sound and especially sane as we continue to kind of work our way through this crazy world today. So thanks, everybody, and we\u2019ll speak to you soon. Bye-bye.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Eric Levin",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. As Steve said, total revenue was down 3.1% in constant currency. On an as-reported basis, it was down 4.5%. I'll break this out in detail in a moment, but the key takeaway is that these results are slightly better than our expectations given the unsurprising impact that COVID had on certain aspects of our business. A big part of this is that streaming revenue continues to show double-digit increases. We remain confident that we're well positioned for long-term growth. From an OIBDA perspective, certain adjustments are necessary to make the year-over-year comparisons more meaningful. The details are in our press release. But in the quarter, we had a charge of $440 million associated with noncash stock-based compensation under our long-term incentive plan, reflecting changes in the value of our common stock as a result of our IPO. This compares to $14 million of noncash stock-based compensation expense in the prior year quarter. We also had $86 million of IPO-related costs and $11 million of expenses related to restructuring and other transformation costs. Going forward, the long-term incentive plan awards will be accounted for as equity, and as such, will not be adjusted for fluctuations in trading value of our common stock. However, we will continue to have stock-based compensation charges for any unvested awards in the plan and for any future awards that may be issued under new clients. From this quarter on, noncash stock-based compensation expense will be excluded from adjusted OIBDA. We believe this provides a more accurate view of how we manage our business. Q3 adjusted OIBDA increased 12% to $166 million due to lower overall costs from COVID-related business disruption and active cost management. Adjusted OIBDA margin increased 2.4 percentage points to 16.4% primarily driven by revenue mix, with a decrease in lower-margin physical and artist services and expanded rights revenue and an increase in higher-margin streaming revenue as well as lower operating costs. In Recorded Music, third quarter revenue was down 4.2%. Digital revenue grew 10% with an 11% increase in streaming revenue. Licensing revenue declined 26% due to lower advertising spend and deal activity resulting from COVID disruption. Physical revenue declined 46% with lower physical sales due to the impact of COVID and the continued shift to stream. Artist services and expanded-rights revenue, which includes merchandising, declined 21% driven by timing of tour schedules as well as COVID-related tour postponements and cancellations and decreased merchandise revenue. Recorded Music adjusted OIBDA increased 14% to $167 million due to overall cost savings and revenue mix. Adjusted OIBDA margin increased 3.4 percentage points to 19.4%. Music Publishing grew its revenue by 3% in Q3. Digital revenue rose 41% due to increases in streaming revenue and timing of digital deals. Mechanicals declined 43% due to continued market decline in physical and the impact of COVID. Sync declined 24%, and performance revenue declined 21% due to COVID-related business disruption. Music Publishing adjusted OIBDA declined 6% or $2 million to $34 million. Adjusted OIBDA margin declined 1.7 percentage points to 22.8% due to revenue mix. Our operating cash flow in Q3 was $123 million versus $150 million in the prior year quarter. The change was largely due to timing of working capital, including royalty payments. CapEx was $20 million compared to $23 million in the prior year quarter. For the full year 2020, we expect the total to be about $80 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $189 million compared to $159 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was largely due to the same factors impacting adjusted OIBDA in addition to higher pro forma savings expected to be realized from certain transformational initiatives. We did not declare or pay a dividend in the quarter as we shift to our new dividend policy. In connection with our IPO, we amended our dividend policy and now intend to pay quarterly cash dividends of $0.12 per share to holders of our common stock. We expect to pay the first dividend under this policy in September 2020. When we reported our Q2 results in early May, we were less than two months into the worsening impact of COVID in most major markets. Since then, we've taken a number of additional steps to protect our business, continuing to adjust spend and allocate our capital in the most prudent and impactful way. Even if the pandemic continues longer than originally expected, we have all the resources and resilience needed to weather this storm. We'll come out of this \u2013 out the other side with our long-term prospects as strong as ever. As of June 30, we had a cash balance of $532 million. Just after our quarter end, we completed the issuance of $535 million of 3 7/8% senior secured notes and EUR 325 million of 2 3/4% senior secured notes. The proceeds of these issuances have been used to refinance all of our 4 1/8%, 4 7/8% and 5% senior secured notes. The effect of this transaction has reduced our weighted average cost of debt from 4% at June 30, 2020, to 3.6%, resulting in $9 million of annual interest savings. We've all learned much during these extraordinary times about our business and our people. We've learned that our biggest source of revenue, streaming, is hugely resilient with music subscriptions continuing to grow in the midst of a global lockdown. Perhaps more importantly, we've learned that our teams, our artists and our songwriters have an incredible ability to pivot and adapt, to keep the company running and the music flowing. With that, operator, please open the line for questions. I mean we \u2013 thanks, Ben. We don't give guidance, so it's hard for me to be very specific. We can certainly say that we're extremely kind of pleased that streaming continues, specifically subscription streaming continues its strong trends and strong double-digit growth on our business. Every market around the world is in a different stage of either recovery and opening or cautiousness around opening. So every market around the world's going to be on a different time frame. So we're continuing to monitor very closely each market. But what we can say is that we're working very diligently to maximize the performance of each of our businesses, each of our revenue streams in each market around the world, given market conditions. And we're managing costs to make sure we're spending where it will have the most impact. So I think that's directionally kind of what I can say there, Ben. Thank you. Great. And I'll take the second question. So on the pace of streaming, Heath, it's really been quite stable. I mean we would describe Q3 as consistently double digits with \u2013 throughout the period, so quite stable. And then as we look forward, we continue to be extremely optimistic about the ongoing strength of streaming and its continuing capabilities, specifically of paid streaming, to continue its growth profile. Thanks, Heath. Great. And I'll take the second piece on the near-term outlook of streaming. Again, we don't give guidance, but we do kind of \u2013 I can kind of describe our philosophy, and philosophy is that we have a very broad portfolio of music and releases globally. And we target continued growth of our business regardless of release schedules. Thanks, Brian. Yes. This is Eric. So our Reported Music streaming grew in constant currency 11%, which we think is a very good way to look at it. And I would say that the \u2013 what we'll call traditional streamers continue to be, by far, the largest proportion of our revenue. So for that level of double-digit growth requires the traditional streamers to have continued strong growth, which I would describe as supplemented by the emerging forms of streaming, which are, as Steve mentioned earlier, are expanding but are a smaller piece of the pie. So the opportunity for them to have that kind of significant impact is over the longer term as they get more and more scale. Thank you. On margins, you specifically asked about A&R, but I'll answer margins broadly but also touch on A&R. So one of our core strategies has been and continues to be to continue to invest organically in our own growth, and A&R is a cornerstone of that. So we continue to invest and broaden our releases of music around the world as an important cornerstone to continuing to grow our business in a growing marketplace, certainly over the long term. But margins in generally, we do see a formula and plan for expansion and that has twofold: one is as Recorded Music continues to shift from physical formats to streaming formats has a natural margin uplift; and two, we are very actively in cost management mode. To give a couple of examples, one is we're well underway with our global financial transformation where we're moving over the next two years at cloud-based SAP S/4HANA solution. And once that is live, we have plans to save $35 million to $40 million a year. We also have started, and we started last year, actually a transformation office, a dedicated transformation office reporting directly to Steve that's focused on looking at opportunities to drive efficiencies through technologies and other tools throughout the business. And we expect to start seeing opportunities to drive business benefits as well as cost savings starting in 2021 from that office. So margin expansion is important to us, but we continue to invest in A&R to help fuel our business growth. Thanks Michael. Great. And Matthew, on the question related to cost, I would say that we remain focused and managing to the same plans that we were related to both our financial transformation and our broader transformation office. I think it's worth noting that working remotely and being in the COVID-affected environment requires different ways to work on those initiatives, and in some cases, different ways of delivering those initiatives. But we've made those adjustments and remain totally comfortable and committed in delivering the transformations that we've been working diligently towards. I can take that. So what I would say is I wouldn't look to four of the top five artists being new to uniquely have an effect on margin. We have a very broad and global portfolio and so it's really the portfolio of music that we're releasing, marketing, the mix that is going to affect margins. So the top five artists are meaningful, but we have such a deep, broad global array of artists that it's \u2013 that I would look \u2013 that we're going to \u2013 that you'd have to look much deeper than that to really see a margin impact. So I wouldn't focus on the top five for margin purposes. On marketing, what I would say is on a ongoing basis, we've had a pretty stable investment in marketing. It's been growing with revenue, and we would expect to continue to grow with revenue as we continue to drive more and more music into the marketplace over time that our marketing supports that. We have said that this quarter, and we will manage quarter-to-quarter in a COVID-affected world to make sure the spend that we're putting into the market is generating the appropriate return, and we'll adjust spend where appropriate. And that adjusting of spend will be across all attributes of spend. It will be across marketing. It will be across travel. It will be across infrastructure and overhead. And so I would just say that this quarter, we evaluated the appropriate level of spend to drive the revenue and make sure that we were managing costs yet still delivering the right marketing impact. Thank you, Kannan. Great. So I would just say that U.S. is impacted by areas such as physical and artist services, which affect the overall revenue growth trends. So those are some of the areas that declined related to COVID that had an impact and those are going to have a bit of a U.S. orientation in this quarter. We don't break out ad-supported streaming from subscription streaming. I would just say directionally that the trends were subscription streaming growth has continued to be robust and ad-supported streaming has been affected is appropriate to say. Clearly, businesses that are pulling back on their marketing budgets and not doing as much advertising affects ad-supported streaming, and that would flow through our numbers as well, but we don't release a specific percentage. Thank you. So I'll take the margin one. So we're very comfortable with where our margins currently are relative to our peers, but we are very focused on expanding our margins from where we are. And we have outlined our kind of strategy, which includes the cost management of our infrastructure. I described our programs before, which will both allow us to generate cost savings, but also have more scalability with our infrastructure. And the continued shift from physical to streaming will also give us margin directionally ongoing and long-term margin improvement. So we're very comfortable with the direction of our margins, how we're managing it and our opportunities for upside. Really hard to answer hypotheticals, but I think we can kind of just look at it not numerically but structurally. And if you look just at Recorded Music first and you look at ad-supported streaming, which clearly was affected; you look at sync, which clearly was affected; you look at artist services, both merch and touring, which were dramatically affected; physical, which was declining, but the acceleration has declined. Although streaming is 70% of our revenue, our largest and fastest-growing source of revenue, these other areas other than physical were all businesses and revenue streams that were growing. So clearly, there'd be a significant opportunity for growth as we were doing prior to COVID. On Publishing, you'd have a similar dynamic. Performance was growing. Sync in Publishing grew in our fiscal first half of the year, 17% in Publishing. So the dynamics for growth prior to COVID and without COVID, obviously, were very strong and favorable. And over the past several years, we've been having a double-digit revenue CAGR. So clearly, COVID has had a material impact. That said, we've said, longer term, as you look \u2013 as COVID recedes in the future, we still feel very good about the long-term prospects and growth potential of our business. We don't really see that any of these areas have been affected \u2013 or that their long-term potential has been inhibited or affected by this. Well, every deal is different. We don't comment on specific deals. But we certainly do have deals where we get a percentage of the ad revenue. I would say that both catalog and new release have strong margin profiles and it's certainly true that new releases will, in some cases have advances. By the way, sometimes catalogs will as well. But so long as we're recouping those advances, and we generally recoup at high rates, the underlying economics of deals can be strong on both. So I would just make that point.

            "name": "Steve Cooper",
            "content": "Thanks, James. Good morning. First, I want to extend to everyone listening today a very warm welcome to our first earnings call as a publicly traded company. I also want to thank everyone who participated in our IPO process, making it a resounding success. And whether you've followed us for years or you're just now getting up to speed, we're very pleased to be speaking with you today. We're holding this call during an extraordinary period of challenging change for both our country and our planet. We continue to grapple with global pandemic while, at the same time, we're at a critical moment of reckoning with systemic inequities. I'll speak more about these issues in a minute. But for anyone who's new to these calls, we thought it would be a good idea to give some background on what makes WMG unique. To begin, we're the only pure-play global music entertainment company on the planet. Warner Music is made up of 3 primary units: our Recorded Music and Music Publishing businesses and our corporate function. But we're driven by a one company and a one team philosophy, which helps maximize the value of all our rights and all of our assets. It's our distinctive combination of scale and nimbleness, creative innovation and financial discipline that gives us our competitive edge. We believe in investing in artist development and backing bold entrepreneurship. We don't believe in buying market share at a loss. Equally, we don't judge ourselves on a quarterly cycle, but rather by how we consistently perform on an annual basis. In short, we play the long game. On the Recorded Music side, our world-renowned record labels include Atlantic, Warner, Elektra and Parlophone. Our artist roster spans every musical genre led by superstars like Cardi B, Coldplay, Dua Lipa, Bruno Mars and Ed Sheeran. At the same time, our rich catalog includes legends such as David Bowie, The Doors, Fleetwood Mac, Aretha Franklin and Prince. As the role of the record label has evolved, we've expanded our suite of groundbreaking artists and label services. These include ADA, which supports independent labels such as BMG and 12 Tone; a merchandise and e-commerce business with clients that include non-Warner artists such as Jennifer Lopez and Shawn Mendes; and a network of wholly owned consumer brands, including UPROXX, the influential youth website; Songkick, the live music app; and EMP, the merchandise e-tailer. Warner Chappell, our music publishing arm, has a history dating back more than 200 years. We currently represent 80,000 songwriters and 1.4 million-plus copyrights around the world from the standards of the great American songbook to the biggest hits of the 21st century, from George Gershwin to George Michael, from Led Zeppelin to Lizzo. Since Access Industries acquired Warner in 2011, we've transformed ourselves from an Anglo-centric company into a global music enterprise in more than 70 countries. We've embraced new technology, becoming the first major music company to strike deals with tech players such as Tencent and Snap. We were also the first to generate more than 50% of our Recorded Music revenue from streaming. And we've invested in a suite of proprietary tools such as our marketing dashboard Opus and our A&R app, Sodatone. With that, let's get to the numbers. This was our first quarter during which COVID was a factor from beginning to end. During Q3, total revenue was down 3.1%. Digital revenue was up 13.4%. Adjusted EBITDA was up 18.9%, and adjusted OIBDA was up 12.2%. Eric will go into more detail shortly. We're very pleased with these results. They highlight the underlying strength and resilience of our business. Our most important metrics remain healthy: streaming growth is strong and our digital transformation continues. Digital revenue was more than 70% of our total revenue on an as-reported basis, and our largest source of revenue streaming was largely unaffected by COVID with Recorded Music jumping 11%. Our results echo encouraging signs across the industry with Nielsen reporting a double-digit consumption increase for on-demand audio streaming in the U.S. from mid-March through early July. We're also seeing increased competition in the streaming arena from newer entrants such as Facebook and Snap. As we said last quarter, some of our revenue streams, including physical sales, artist services and sync, have been affected by the pandemic. We expect that, for the most part, these revenue streams will recover over time as businesses reopen and economies begin to normalize. Physical is the only one of these revenue streams that was consistently decreasing pre-COVID, and in recent months, that decline has accelerated. In Recorded Music, physical revenue fell nearly 46% in the quarter. In Music Publishing, mechanical revenue from physical sales was down almost 43%. As the pandemic continues, especially as we're seeing new spikes in some countries, companies across many different industries are expecting a prolonged period of economic disruption. Against that backdrop, we're very, very fortunate to be in a sector that creates something so vital to people's lives. During this quarter, our team and our company were pressure tested, and we're more confident than ever about our long-term future. While we certainly won't become complacent, it's clear our formula is working. We're seeing success with a broad diversity of artists across genres, geographies and generations. We're especially proud of our ability to attract original talent often early in their careers and develop them into global superstars. Our commitment to new artist development is illustrated by the fact that 4 out of our top 5 best sellers this quarter were from artists releasing either debut or sophomore albums: Dua Lipa, Lil Uzi Vert, Roddy Ricch and Tones And I. In the U.S., Nielsen's 2020 midyear report again proved our ability to have massive hits with artists at every stage of their careers. This included Roddy Ricch's hit single, The Box, which is the most streamed song of 2020 and the only track with 1 billion streams in the U.S. alone. We also had 3 of the top 10 artists by total consumption as well as the number 1 and number 2 biggest pop songs during the first half of the calendar year. Our strength across multiple genres has been a real advantage during COVID. For example, Nielsen reported that country music experienced a significant surge in streaming during the quarter. And we've been at the forefront of the genre with Kenny Chesney hitting number 1 on the U.S. album chart and 2 new artists, Gabby Barrett and Ingrid Andress, both topping the country charts with breakthrough releases. We've continued to have strong momentum internationally as well. In April, Warner Music Russia had nine of the top ten tracks on the local Apple music chart, including Egor Kreed at number one. Italy scored number ones on 4 separate charts with Ghali, Pink Floyd and Achille Lauro, France had top-charting hits with Da Uzi and Ninho and Spain hit number with Fred De Palma. We're also very pleased to say that we kicked off Q4 with successful new releases from country star Brett Eldredge; Dutch rapper, Boef; Brazil's Anitta; the UK's Tinie Tempah and the U.S.' Charlie Puth and Saweetie, among others. Revenue from our Music Publishing business remains very strong, with global digital revenue up 41% in Q3. During the quarter, Warner Chappell songwriters contributed to a remarkable 13 songs that hit number one across the Billboard charts, including The Weeknd's massive hit Blinding Lights, co-written by Canada's Belly and Sweden's Oscar Holter. Other chart-topping songwriters included the U.S.' Yeti Beats, the UK's Liam Gallagher, Brazil's [indiscernible], the Netherlands Shirak, Italy's Tedua and Spain's C. Tangana. As I mentioned, one of our core strengths is to keep up a strong ever-growing flow of new music. During COVID, we're unavoidably experiencing some shifts in our release plans due to changes in recording and songwriting schedules. To counteract that, we've prioritized signing new talent while giving our artists and songwriters the tools and environment they need to create and collaborate. We have dozens of in-house studios around the world, which have become safe havens for artists to work during the crisis. And where that's not possible, we're finding inventive workarounds. By way of example, Warner Music Mexico shipped home recording kits to many of its artists. To support our songwriters and producers, Warner Chappell has run more than ten virtual songwriting camps since March so that they can continue to make music and stay connected globally. And Recorded Music hosted a very successful global sync showcase with acclaimed artist, Lianne La Havas, bringing her music to commercial partners all over the world. Meanwhile, Warner Chappell continued its creative revitalization with an aggressive global signing campaign. Among the world-class songwriters to join the company in Q3 were country star Thomas Rhett, iconic Mexican group Bronco, and the late rapper, Pop Smoke, whose posthumous album debuted at #1 on the U.S. album chart. Warner Chappell also renewed its deals with a number of its global superstars, including Spain's Pablo Alboran, Germany's Capital Bra and Sweden's Miss Li. Since our acquisition by Access in 2011, Warner Music has become a worldwide platform where our artists and their music can come from anywhere and resonate everywhere. As I said earlier, we're now in over 70 countries, and even during COVID, we've continued to expand our global reach. Earlier this year, Recorded Music opened new offices in Vietnam, India and Turkey, while Warner Chappell opened in Shanghai to capitalize on the exploding Chinese market. We've forged new innovative partnerships with Punjabi specialist, Ziiki Media in India and with Africori, the largest music distributor in sub-Saharan Africa. More than ever, we're seeing the value that major music companies bring to the entire music ecosystem, cutting through the noise and deepening the connections between artists and fans across the globe. The COVID-induced absence of live concerts has crystallized our value to creative talent like never before. We're helping our artists and songwriters take more risks and be more adventurous than ever as they look for new ways to connect with fans in a world of social distancing. A key element driving this connection over the past few months has been the growing world of live streams and virtual events. A few highlights include David Guetta's United At Home livestream benefit, which had 12 million viewers; an innovative paid admission virtual concert with the rock band Trivium, which also led to a spike in merch sales; and hugely successful events in Finland, France, Spain and elsewhere around the globe. We've always believed that music is a force for good in the world, and that our artists, songwriters and our team can have a powerful influence in bringing about changes that we all want to see. Recent horrific events have made it clear that concrete actions must be taken to combat all forms of social injustice, and at the same time, champion diversity and inclusion. In June, we announced that the Warner Music Group and the Blavatnik Family Foundation were establishing a $100 million fund to support social justice education, the music ecosystem and campaigns against violence and racism. Recently, we announced the 15 members of the fund's Board of Directors, including highly accomplished people such as Mona Sutphen, the former White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy under President Obama; and Paul Henderson of the San Francisco Department of Police Accountability. Yesterday, we announced the appointment of a dedicated Head of Global Equity, Diversity and Inclusion, Dr. Maurice Stinnett, a well-known leader in the field. We've also established an Executive Diversity & Inclusion Council, which will further unite our core values with our business objectives. We will continue to mount a concerted sustained drive to effect real change in our company, our industry and our society. Let me conclude by saying I'm incredibly proud of how endlessly adaptive, creative and solution-driven our teams, artists and songwriters across the globe have been during this unprecedented time. Music is central to the lives of every person on this planet. We remain perfectly positioned to satisfy the essential human need for entertainment, solace and connection. And now I'll turn it over to Eric. Sure, and good morning, nice to chat with you. Well, live has obviously been negatively impacted by the pandemic. But it is provided for us the opportunity to pivot far more quickly into live streaming and virtual concerts. We have been experimenting with it for some time, but we have now taken meaningful additional steps to support our artists and to support their loss of live revenue with this digital reinterpretation of live. So it has hastened our move into the live streaming world. It's hastened our move into the virtual concert world. And I would expect that in the future, our activity in those areas are going to expand. So that's one positive. Another positive that we have found is that with the shutdown of live, it's become more important for our artists and for us to have consistent engagement with their fan base, both by way of their existing music, but as importantly, producing new music. And we've seen with many of our artists around the globe an uptick in the output of new music, both from our established and new artists, and that's been good news. The downside is that, obviously, there are certain operations that require our people to be in either our video studios or other's video studios and that's been a bit difficult. But slowly but surely, we see that returning. And hopefully, over the next few months, given our network of studios, both recording and video and the protocols that we put in place to keep them safe and sound, that business will begin to normalize over the next 3, 6, 9, 12 months. So all in all, we have provided what I would call really a very safe harbor environment for artists where they can continue to work, to collaborate, to write songs, to produce music. So why don't I go first? There is this old phrase that nature abhors a vacuum. And the loss of live because of the pandemic has created a vacuum. And I think that, that's a situation where we will do all that we can to begin to fill it. I think that people's habits change over time. I think the pandemic and the isolation has created changes in habits, changes in behavior. People are becoming more used to live streaming to virtual concerts and it's an area that I believe presents both a short, intermediate and long-term opportunity for us. And so my expectation is that our operators, with the support of corporate, will be doing more and more in those areas. And I expect it by way of what we offer our artists. I expect that those capabilities and our offerings to expand to fill that vacuum, Heath. Okay. Brian. So on the first point \u2013 sorry, I seem to have a frog in my throat this morning. On the first point, one of the things that we told our potential equity investors on our road show is we look to do two things: a, revenue diversification; and b, when we see new economic models emerging, to support those models and their growth in the short term by establishing both an operating and economic relationship with them that allows them better opportunities to boost their growth and by us taking that posture as they grow than sharing in their success differently as we renew our deals over time. Our expectation is that these alternate distribution paths, particularly the social platforms, will over time be significant revenue contributors to Warner music. Sure. I can't give you specifics, but what I can tell you is, broadly speaking, and Eric can give you more specifics, but broadly speaking, streaming continues to enjoy very robust growth, both in developed and in emerging markets. So that's number one. And there, I'm talking about the traditional streamers: Spotify, Apple, YouTube, Amazon. We're also seeing that there are new competitors, as you indicated, coming into the market. These social platforms, even though they are \u2013 they serve a different purpose than a YouTube or a Spotify, but they have discovered that music is, as we've always believed, relevant and important to virtually everybody on the planet and they are developing within their own ecospheres their own models for the utilization in music, and we expect that to continue, not only on social platforms, but when you look at other routes of distribution like fitness. You see it with Peloton. So we think that's great from both a competitive as well as a revenue diversification point of view. We think the growth both in \u2013 from traditional streaming as well as these new models will continue at a very nice pace for the foreseeable future. And we see in new emerging models that we haven't seen any substantial growth yet from and new ones popping up every day that music is more often than not becoming a foundational building block. So we continue not only to be excited about traditional streaming, these new large platforms sort of utilizing music, but also the future where new models emerge weekly, monthly that utilize music. So we continue to be very excited about our future. Eric, can you take that? So let me first address Spotify, then I'll address growth in TikTok. We have experimented with Spotify tools, Marquee and other tools. And if we choose to utilize them, we can utilize them on the same basis as our substantial competitors. So we look at all of these tools, we look at marketing not as an expense, but as an investment. And so when we expend marketing dollars, we look at how and where and when we get the best return on investment. If we find that's a Spotify tool, we utilize it. If we find it's other approaches, we utilize them. What we don't do is utilize tools where we don't get sufficient return on investment, Jessica. So that's number one. Number two, we see robust growth for the foreseeable future coming from both the developed markets, North America, Western Europe and very robust growth from emerging markets. Obviously, the emerging markets have a different model because of however you measure it, their GDP, the per capita income, the number of people that are categorized as middle class, on and on and on. But what we do see is even with a more compacted economic model in those emerging markets, it has \u2013 streaming has had a meaningful reduction in piracy where we would get a 100% of zero. So the growth, the conversion of people, even if it's on the free side, is converting people out of piracy into something that ultimately allows them to convert into premium utilization. And that's good for the music industry and it's good for the streamers. With respect to TikTok, TikTok is a \u2013 it is not really a \u2013 it's not a social platform. It's an app where the creators are the audience, the audience are the creators. And what we find, it is a source of discovery, both by way of new music and A&R. So from that perspective, it's very important to us. Economically, it is much more in the start-up category. And because of the economics in India, it will not, in the short term, have a meaningful impact on our revenue. Hopefully, that answers your question. So I'll take the first, Michael, and Eric will take the second. So first of all, we're very happy that Spotify is investing in podcasting. It gives them an opportunity to create another vertical that they can create not only an ad-free service around, but presumably, over time, a premium service. I believe personally that there will be people that come to Spotify for a podcast and stay for music, and that there will be people that come to Spotify for music and stay for a podcast. It does not impact our economics, either on the free side or the subscription side. But hopefully, what it will do is create appeal to a broader audience. And if you remember your Venn diagrams, I'm sure that there will be a overlap in those Venn diagrams that drive people from podcasting to music and music to podcasting. I also believe that, that being said, that Spotify's basic foundation stone or basic foundation will always be music, Michael. I don't see that changing anywhere near the foreseeable future. Hopefully, that's responsive to your question, and I'll turn it over to Eric on the other piece. Thanks for the questions, Matthew. So we're constantly looking at opportunities to better support our artist opportunities. So we look at, on a regular basis, the interfaces with any number of platforms and what we can do better by way of driving music, merch, ticketing, so on and so forth. We are \u2013 and we \u2013 as I said, we're in regular discussions with these platforms about how can we expand this, how can we be more productive doing that. So we do look at it. We do, in certain instances, see opportunities. In other instances, frankly, with our wholly owned sites or wholly owned apps, we find that we can create because of the focus on a specific mission with specific artists, oftentimes drive additional revenue better than these large DSPs. But yes, we're looking all the time. Great. And on the M&A part, John, we are seeing a lot of opportunities. And where we believe that we can execute a rational, financially and operationally disciplined deals, we move forward on them and we try and close. I will say this that the market is, looks to me, somewhere between crazy and really, really crazy. And we've got a real cost of capital. So we continue to be very financially disciplined on one side and very disciplined when we look at these operations so that we know that they can be reasonably and thoughtfully integrated even as a stand-alone unit into the envelope under the Warner Music Group. But we are not allowing COVID to screw up our brains and make us lose our wraparound, which is financial discipline. We are looking at the podcast ecosphere, and we currently, with a number of our recording artists, create podcasts. That being said, the economics of podcasting remain pretty opaque. And while we are prowling around that space, we haven't really found anything yet, Ivan that has really caught our eye. Yes, there might be. We just \u2013 we keep looking at the economic model of podcasting to figure out whether or not there's something that makes sense for us to do and whether or not there's something that can really be done at scale. And we're going to continue to look at it. Obviously, we're in the content, the intellectual property and the artist business. And you're right, there may be opportunities. We just haven't seen the right ones yet, Ivan. You're more than welcome. Have a great day. Well, again, I want to thank everybody for joining us today. I want to welcome again our new shareholders. Hopefully, this has been an informative session, and we look forward to chatting with you again after our fourth quarter. So I hope everybody stays safe and sound and especially sane as we continue to kind of work our way through this crazy world today. So thanks, everybody, and we'll speak to you soon. Bye-bye."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to Warner Music Group's Second Quarter Earnings Call for the Period Ended March 31, 2020. At the request of Warner Music Group, today's call is being recorded for replay purposes. And if you object, you may disconnect at any time.\n Now I would like to turn today's call over to your host, Mr. James Steven, Executive Vice President and Chief Communications Officer. You may begin. \nJames Steven: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Warner Music Group's Fiscal Second Quarter Ended March 31, 2020 Conference Call. Both our earnings press release and the Form 10-Q we filed this morning are available on our website. Today, our CEO, Steve Cooper, will update you on our business performance and strategy and then our Executive Vice President and CFO, Eric Levin, will discuss our financial condition and results. Usually, we then open the call for questions. However, in February, we filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the SEC for a proposed IPO. As a result, we remain in a quiet period, and we have decided not to take questions this quarter.\n Before Steve's comments, let me remind you that this communication includes forward-looking statements that reflect the current views of Warner Music Group about future events and financial performance. All forward-looking statements are made as of today, and we disclaim any duty to update such statements.\n Our expectations, beliefs and projections are expressed in good faith, and we believe there is a reasonable basis for them. However, there can be no assurance that management's expectations, beliefs and projections will result or be achieved. Investors should not rely on forward-looking statements because they are subject to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors that can cause actual results that differ materially from our expectations.\n Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in our earnings press release, our Form 10-Q and Form 10-K and other SEC filings.\n We plan to present certain non-GAAP results during this conference call. We have provided schedules reconciling these results to our GAAP results in our earnings press release posted on our website. Also, please note that all revenue figures and comparisons discussed today will be presented in constant currency unless otherwise noted.\n And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve Cooper. \nStephen Cooper: Hi, everyone. Thanks so much for joining us in the midst of this difficult time. I hope that you and your families are all keeping safe, sound, sane and out of harm's way. As James noted, we decided not to do a Q&A session today. That being said, I want to address one topic upfront, what's happening with our IPO. As you'll appreciate, we're in a regulatory quiet period, and we're limited in what we can say. The current market conditions are obvious, so our Board and management will continue to monitor the situation.\n In Q1, we achieved the highest quarterly revenue in our 16-year history as a stand-alone company. And well before the pandemic turned all of our lives upside down, we knew Q2 this year would be a tough comparison with an especially strong Q2 in 2019. In the prior year quarter, our results included the impact of a onetime digital streaming license and unusually high physical revenue due to several very successful physical-centric releases. So I'm really very pleased to report that due in large part to an 11% increase in streaming revenue in recorded music and a 17% increase in digital revenue in music publishing, we've matched our great performance in the prior year quarter. That's a tremendous achievement, especially given the unusual circumstances that I'll explain shortly.\n During this quarter, total revenue was flat, digital revenue was up 7.4% and OIBDA was down 93.7%. It's important to note that this OIBDA result doesn't properly reflect our great operating performance or the strong underlying health of our business. That's because we had an abnormal level of noise in our numbers this quarter, including expenses associated with our long-term incentive plan, which are a direct reflection of the strength of our results and the rising value of our company; expenses relating to restructuring and music publishing and other transformation expenses, including our financial system upgrade; reserves taken by us due to the outbreak of COVID; and expenses relating to the proposed IPO. Without these expenses, our OIBDA would have been $212 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter.\n I also want to note that as of this quarter, we will report adjusted EBITDA figures in our quarterly earnings releases. Since we included adjusted EBITDA and our S-1 for the proposed IPO, we want to continue to update you on it going forward. Adjusted EBITDA for the 12 months ending March 31 was $755 million compared to roughly $1.1 billion for the comparable prior year period. The decrease was largely the result of the impact of the net gain on the sale of our Spotify shares in 2019. Taking that out of the equation, adjusted EBITDA would have increased by $47 million, largely driven by the growth in stream. This is another demonstration of the continued strong fundamentals underlying our business. Eric will, of course, provide more detail later.\n Like all businesses, ours is facing unique challenges in 2020. During the pandemic, we expected our -- we expect our physical artist services and synchronization revenue streams to be somewhat affected. We won't really know the exact impact of COVID until we see our Q3 results, but there may also be some shifts in our release plans due to changes in recording and songwriting schedules. Having gone through 2 decades of industry transformation, we're now in a position where almost 70% of our revenue is digital, and that percentage continues to grow. This makes us more resilient in a crisis such as this. As a result, digital revenue was not materially impacted by COVID in the quarter. Perfect examples are major new albums from Dua Lipa, Lil Uzi Vert and PARTYNEXTDOOR, all released in March, just as the pandemic was impacting major markets, they're enjoying global success supported by massive streaming and social media awareness.\n We're very pleased with the global diversity and chart-topping successes of our A&R activities across both emerging and superstar talent as well as our thriving catalog business. Among the quarter's top recorded music sellers were, Roddy Ricch's debut album, Please Excuse Me for Being Antisocial, featuring the global smash, The Box, which spent 11 weeks at #1 in the U.S.; Dua Lipa's second album, Future Nostalgia, which saw her become the third most listened to artist on Spotify globally; and albums from 2 artists that we're pleased to work with across both recorded music and music publishing, multi-Grammy winner Lizzo and Australian sensation, Tones and I, whose global smash, Dance Monkey, crossed the 1 billion streams mark. On the international front, best sellers included Japan's Kobukuro and Korea's Twice. We also saw #1 chart success stories in multiple markets across the globe, including Ghali in Italy, [ Gondi ] in France and Capital Bra in Germany.\n At Warner Chappell, our momentum continues to build. With revenue up 8%, our songwriters contributed to every #1 song on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart this quarter, including Belly and Oscar Holter on the Weeknd's Blinding Lights and 30 Roc and Dat Boi Squeeze on Roddy Ricch's The Box. As mentioned earlier, our digital revenue was rising at a healthy pace. In light of streaming's continued growth, I'm happy to say that we recently renewed our licensing partnership with Spotify and we're looking forward to collaborating with them on impactful campaigns for our artists and songwriters and working together to grow the global industry.\n Against this backdrop, we're also pleased to see some recent legal decisions that help protect the value of music. Following the $1 billion verdict against Cox Communications in December, the majors continue to make progress in other ISP cases, including those against Grande, Charter, Bright House and RCN.\n Now I'd like to turn to the pandemic. It's certainly no secret that we're in uncharted territory, what one of my colleagues happily called business unusual. Right now, our priorities are to protect the health of our people and our company, sustain our artists' and songwriters' livelihoods and support the wider music ecosystem. Ultimately, we will come out of this awful situation having absorbed some valuable lessons while evolving into a company that's even stronger and more efficient.\n So what are we learning in this unprecedented environment? First and foremost, we're seeing how vital and important music is to people's daily lives. In difficult times like these, music can lift people's spirits, transport them and make them feel connected and safe. The global appetite for great music is higher than ever and will continue to expand. It's still early days, but we're seeing daily consumption patterns shifting to reflect people's new working-from-home reality. Initially, at least, we've not seen fundamental changes in the dynamic of the streaming subscription business which remains strong and healthy.\n Second, our A&R teams are demonstrating their ability to find new and imaginative ways to help and support our artists' and songwriters' creative processes even in the most challenging circumstances. Great talent always rises to the occasion in good times and bad, and incredible music is being written and recorded right now, not only about the crisis itself but about life, relationships and resiliency.\n Just a few examples. Atlantic artist and Warner Chappell songwriter, Alec Benjamin, released Six Feet Apart a moving song about social distancing. He recorded the vocals and guitar on his phone, and the track was written and produced over Face Time. The 2 members of Twenty One Pilots collaborated remotely on a fantastic new song and inventive video, Level of Concern. At Warner Chappell, they've responded by setting up a series of video dates between songwriters who've never met before. And in the midst of the pandemic, Warner Music Italy couldn't film the traditional video for their breakout superstar, Ghali. So they supported the artist's vision by organizing fans to sing the song from their homes and created a video with user-generated content that brought everyone together. We're also not missing a beat when it comes to attracting the next-generation of talent. We're already adept at negotiating and signing deals remotely and we're accelerating the adoption and use of our proprietary A&R tool, Sodatone, to identify emerging artists across the globe.\n Third, our ability to cut through all the noise on streaming services is more valuable than ever to our artists and songwriters. We pivoted quickly implementing imaginative solutions to not only compensate for the abrupt halt to live promotional appearances but to actually deepen the connections between artists and fans. Songkick, the world's leading gig discovery tool, which we acquired in 2017, has been at the forefront of this effort. They've staged a series of livestream gigs by artists such as France's Christophe Ma\u00e9, the U.K.'s Rudimental and Sweden's Paul Rey to name just a few. And we continue to focus on moving into emerging markets to expand our reach for both global superstars and local talent.\n At the beginning of April, we unveiled our new office in Vietnam where they marked the opening in grand style by nailing the top 3 spots on the country's Spotify playlist. This follows our recent launch of operations in India and Turkey.\n None of us can be sure how long this situation is going to last. So we believe that besides supporting our people, our artists and our songwriters. Through this tough time, we need to help those less fortunate than ourselves. We've set aside a central multimillion-dollar fund to support both local and global COVID-related philanthropic efforts over an extended period of time. We're helping the fight against the virus by donating to groups such as the World Health Organization and Heart to Heart International.\n We're helping people across the music community, not only artists and songwriters in need of emergency aid, but also the wider ecosystem of technicians, session musicians, production crews and tour managers with donations to music-focused organizations such as use of MusiCares, the Health Musicians Fund, the Unison Fund, the Jazz Foundation and the Crexendo Trust.\n We're also supporting the efforts of our artists and songwriters to make a difference. One highlight was the hugely successful PlayOn Fest, a first-of-its-kind global virtual music festival presented by the Warner Music Group. Held over the last weekend of April, it benefited the World Health Organization's COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund.\n Right now, our global teams, our artists and our songwriters are proving just how flexible, endlessly creative and solution-driven they are. As I've noted in the past, we're the planet's only pure-play global music entertainment company. Both our scale and our nimbleness will serve us very well in the coming months as we keep the music flowing and fans engaged. I'm very optimistic that our distinctive combination of creative innovation and financial discipline will see us whether this storm and emerge stronger, better and more agile than ever.\n With that, I'll now turn it over to Eric. \nEric Levin: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. As Steve said, total revenue was flat in constant currency. On an as-reported basis, it was down slightly at 1.7%. While our headline performance isn't as impressive as in recent quarters, we're anticipating a very tough comparison with a strong Q2 2019, and our results are in line with what our expectations were for this 1 quarter. I'd also like to add that while COVID presents real and significant challenges to our industry, we remain very confident that we're well positioned for long-term growth.\n From an OIBDA perspective, certain adjustments are necessary to make the year-over-year comparisons more meaningful. The details are in our press release. But in the quarter, we had a charge of $169 million associated with variable compensation under our long-term incentive plan due to an increase in our valuation. This compares to $5 million of variable compensation expense in the prior year quarter. We also had $31 million of onetime expenses related to restructuring and publishing associated with management changes, the upgrade of our financial system, reserves taken due to COVID and cost of our proposed IPO. Q2 adjusted OIBDA declined 78% to $43 million, and adjusted OIBDA margin declined 16.4 percentage points to 1.1%, primarily driven by higher variable compensation expense. Excluding the impact of this higher expense, Q2 adjusted OIBDA would have increased $8 million or 3.9%. Adjusted OIBDA margin increased 1.1 percentage points to 19.8% due to revenue mix.\n Based on our valuation at quarter end, we would expect the payout associated with our long-term incentive plan to be approximately $400 million, which relates to the redemption of equity interests, with the majority expected to be paid out in fiscal '21.\n In recorded music, second quarter revenue was down 1.5%. Digital revenue grew 6% driven by an 11% increase in streaming revenue. Adjusting for the onetime impact of the pre-1972 digital streaming license with SiriusXM in Q2 2019, digital revenue grew 9% and driven by a 14% increase in streaming revenue. Licensing revenue increased 3% due to timing of payments. Physical revenue declined 28%, mostly due to timing of strong physical releases in the prior year quarter and also due to ongoing industry trends and the impact of COVID this quarter. Artist services and expanded rights revenue, which includes merchandising, declined 13% driven by timing of tour schedules as well as some COVID-related tour postponements.\n Recorded music adjusted OIBDA declined 52% to $89 million due to higher variable compensation expense. Adjusted OIBDA margin declined 10.9 percentage points to 8.4%. Excluding the impact of this higher expense, Q2 adjusted OIBDA would have increased $3 million or 1.6%. Adjusted OIBDA margin increased 0.9 percentage points to 21.1% due to revenue mix.\n We are pleased that after only a year of new leadership under Guy Moot and Carianne Marshall, Music Publishing grew its revenue by 8% in Q2. Digital revenue rose 17% as streaming revenue continues to grow. Mechanicals increased 25% due to timing of distributions; synchros, 10%, due to our expanded sync team driving greater revenue from licensing for TV and commercials. These gains were partially offset by a 9% decline in performance revenue due to timing of distributions and the impact of COVID. Music Publishing adjusted OIBDA grew 4% or $2 million to $49 million. Adjusted OIBDA margin declined 0.2 percentage points to 29.5% due to timing of A&R investment.\n Our operating cash flow in Q2 was $86 million versus $7 million in the prior year quarter. The chink was largely due to timing of receivables and strong working capital management. CapEx was $13 million compared with $33 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease was due to the completion of spend on our L.A. headquarters in the prior year. For the full year '20, we had expected total CapEx of about $100 million due to spend on the upgrade of our financial system, but the actual spend should be closer to $80 million, with the remainder shifted to fiscal '21.\n Adjusted EBITDA for the last 12 months ended March 31, 2020, was $755 million compared to $1.097 billion for the comparable prior year of LTM period. The chink was largely a result of the impact of a net gain of $389 million from the sale of the company's Spotify share in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of the Spotify share sale, adjusted EBITDA would have increased $47 million to $755 million, largely driven by the growth in streaming. While we have previously reported adjusted EBITDA in our SEC filings as a measure of covenant compliance, from this quarter forward, we plan to also update you on it in our filings and our earnings calls as a performance metric.\n On April 17, we paid a regular quarterly dividend of $37.5 million as compared to our Q2 '19 dividend of $31.25 million. We expect to pay the same $37.5 million dividend in Q3 and, consistent with our policy, will determine any potential variable dividend for Q4 at fiscal year-end.\n Like many other companies right now, we're managing our finances carefully to help us respond to the COVID-related business disruption of our industry and the economy at large. In the short term, we're taking all the prudent steps you would expect: we're adjusting spend, and we're allocating our resources to where they'll be the most impactful. In the long term, our prospects are as strong as ever. As of March 31, we had a cash balance of $484 million. In addition, on April 3, in the midst of this chaos, we managed to amend our revolving credit agreement expanding the size from $180 million to $300 million, extending the maturity, reducing the interest margin and improving covenants. This transaction is a real show of confidence by the financial community and our company's strength. While we haven't needed to draw on the revolver in the past 5 years, it's helpful to know it's available to us if necessary.\n So while we're realistic about the pressures created by COVID, we're staying light on our feet and remaining positive about the future. Our industry becomes more digital every day. And our biggest source of revenue, streaming, is also the most durable and recurrent. Not only that, music subscription services are an incredible value for consumers. And subscriber growth is continuing.\n These are extraordinary times, but I'm proud to say this situation is bringing out the best in our teams around the world. Our people are showing great creativity, resilience and empathy as they're supporting our artists and songwriters and keeping an amazing music flowing to fans everywhere. We have some excellent releases in the market and have some hugely exciting music on the way.\n As Steve mentioned, because we're in a regulatory quiet period, we won't be doing a Q&A session today. We'd like to thank you all for joining, and hope everyone stays safe and healthy. We look forward to speaking to you again soon. Thank you, and have a great day.",

Excluding the impact of this higher expense, Q2 adjusted OIBDA would have increased $8 million or 3.9%. Adjusted OIBDA margin increased 1.1 percentage points to 19.8% due to revenue mix.\n Based on our valuation at quarter end, we would expect the payout associated with our long-term incentive plan to be approximately $400 million, which relates to the redemption of equity interests, with the majority expected to be paid out in fiscal '21.\n In recorded music, second quarter revenue was down 1.5%. Digital revenue grew 6% driven by an 11% increase in streaming revenue. Adjusting for the onetime impact of the pre-1972 digital streaming license with SiriusXM in Q2 2019, digital revenue grew 9% and driven by a 14% increase in streaming revenue. Licensing revenue increased 3% due to timing of payments. Physical revenue declined 28%, mostly due to timing of strong physical releases in the prior year quarter and also due to ongoing industry trends and the impact of COVID this quarter. Artist services and expanded rights revenue, which includes merchandising, declined 13% driven by timing of tour schedules as well as some COVID-related tour postponements.\n Recorded music adjusted OIBDA declined 52% to $89 million due to higher variable compensation expense. Adjusted OIBDA margin declined 10.9 percentage points to 8.4%. Excluding the impact of this higher expense, Q2 adjusted OIBDA would have increased $3 million or 1.6%. Adjusted OIBDA margin increased 0.9 percentage points to 21.1% due to revenue mix.\n We are pleased that after only a year of new leadership under Guy Moot and Carianne Marshall, Music Publishing grew its revenue by 8% in Q2. Digital revenue rose 17% as streaming revenue continues to grow. Mechanicals increased 25% due to timing of distributions; synchros, 10%, due to our expanded sync team driving greater revenue from licensing for TV and commercials. These gains were partially offset by a 9% decline in performance revenue due to timing of distributions and the impact of COVID. Music Publishing adjusted OIBDA grew 4% or $2 million to $49 million. Adjusted OIBDA margin declined 0.2 percentage points to 29.5% due to timing of A&R investment.\n Our operating cash flow in Q2 was $86 million versus $7 million in the prior year quarter. The chink was largely due to timing of receivables and strong working capital management. CapEx was $13 million compared with $33 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease was due to the completion of spend on our L.A. headquarters in the prior year. For the full year '20, we had expected total CapEx of about $100 million due to spend on the upgrade of our financial system, but the actual spend should be closer to $80 million, with the remainder shifted to fiscal '21.\n Adjusted EBITDA for the last 12 months ended March 31, 2020, was $755 million compared to $1.097 billion for the comparable prior year of LTM period. The chink was largely a result of the impact of a net gain of $389 million from the sale of the company's Spotify share in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of the Spotify share sale, adjusted EBITDA would have increased $47 million to $755 million, largely driven by the growth in streaming. While we have previously reported adjusted EBITDA in our SEC filings as a measure of covenant compliance, from this quarter forward, we plan to also update you on it in our filings and our earnings calls as a performance metric.\n On April 17, we paid a regular quarterly dividend of $37.5 million as compared to our Q2 '19 dividend of $31.25 million. We expect to pay the same $37.5 million dividend in Q3 and, consistent with our policy, will determine any potential variable dividend for Q4 at fiscal year-end.\n Like many other companies right now, we're managing our finances carefully to help us respond to the COVID-related business disruption of our industry and the economy at large. In the short term, we're taking all the prudent steps you would expect: we're adjusting spend, and we're allocating our resources to where they'll be the most impactful. In the long term, our prospects are as strong as ever. As of March 31, we had a cash balance of $484 million. In addition, on April 3, in the midst of this chaos, we managed to amend our revolving credit agreement expanding the size from $180 million to $300 million, extending the maturity, reducing the interest margin and improving covenants. This transaction is a real show of confidence by the financial community and our company's strength. While we haven't needed to draw on the revolver in the past 5 years, it's helpful to know it's available to us if necessary.\n So while we're realistic about the pressures created by COVID, we're staying light on our feet and remaining positive about the future. Our industry becomes more digital every day. And our biggest source of revenue, streaming, is also the most durable and recurrent. Not only that, music subscription services are an incredible value for consumers. And subscriber growth is continuing.\n These are extraordinary times, but I'm proud to say this situation is bringing out the best in our teams around the world. Our people are showing great creativity, resilience and empathy as they're supporting our artists and songwriters and keeping an amazing music flowing to fans everywhere. We have some excellent releases in the market and have some hugely exciting music on the way.\n As Steve mentioned, because we're in a regulatory quiet period, we won't be doing a Q&A session today. We'd like to thank you all for joining, and hope everyone stays safe and healthy. We look forward to speaking to you again soon. Thank you, and have a great day."

            "content": "Hi, everyone. Thanks so much for joining us in the midst of this difficult time. I hope that you and your families are all keeping safe, sound, sane and out of harm's way. As James noted, we decided not to do a Q&A session today. That being said, I want to address one topic upfront, what's happening with our IPO. As you'll appreciate, we're in a regulatory quiet period, and we're limited in what we can say. The current market conditions are obvious, so our Board and management will continue to monitor the situation.\n In Q1, we achieved the highest quarterly revenue in our 16-year history as a stand-alone company. And well before the pandemic turned all of our lives upside down, we knew Q2 this year would be a tough comparison with an especially strong Q2 in 2019. In the prior year quarter, our results included the impact of a onetime digital streaming license and unusually high physical revenue due to several very successful physical-centric releases. So I'm really very pleased to report that due in large part to an 11% increase in streaming revenue in recorded music and a 17% increase in digital revenue in music publishing, we've matched our great performance in the prior year quarter. That's a tremendous achievement, especially given the unusual circumstances that I'll explain shortly.\n During this quarter, total revenue was flat, digital revenue was up 7.4% and OIBDA was down 93.7%. It's important to note that this OIBDA result doesn't properly reflect our great operating performance or the strong underlying health of our business. That's because we had an abnormal level of noise in our numbers this quarter, including expenses associated with our long-term incentive plan, which are a direct reflection of the strength of our results and the rising value of our company; expenses relating to restructuring and music publishing and other transformation expenses, including our financial system upgrade; reserves taken by us due to the outbreak of COVID; and expenses relating to the proposed IPO. Without these expenses, our OIBDA would have been $212 million, an increase of 4% over the prior year quarter.\n I also want to note that as of this quarter, we will report adjusted EBITDA figures in our quarterly earnings releases. Since we included adjusted EBITDA and our S-1 for the proposed IPO, we want to continue to update you on it going forward. Adjusted EBITDA for the 12 months ending March 31 was $755 million compared to roughly $1.1 billion for the comparable prior year period. The decrease was largely the result of the impact of the net gain on the sale of our Spotify shares in 2019. Taking that out of the equation, adjusted EBITDA would have increased by $47 million, largely driven by the growth in stream. This is another demonstration of the continued strong fundamentals underlying our business. Eric will, of course, provide more detail later.\n Like all businesses, ours is facing unique challenges in 2020. During the pandemic, we expected our -- we expect our physical artist services and synchronization revenue streams to be somewhat affected. We won't really know the exact impact of COVID until we see our Q3 results, but there may also be some shifts in our release plans due to changes in recording and songwriting schedules. Having gone through 2 decades of industry transformation, we're now in a position where almost 70% of our revenue is digital, and that percentage continues to grow. This makes us more resilient in a crisis such as this. As a result, digital revenue was not materially impacted by COVID in the quarter. Perfect examples are major new albums from Dua Lipa, Lil Uzi Vert and PARTYNEXTDOOR, all released in March, just as the pandemic was impacting major markets, they're enjoying global success supported by massive streaming and social media awareness.\n We're very pleased with the global diversity and chart-topping successes of our A&R activities across both emerging and superstar talent as well as our thriving catalog business. Among the quarter's top recorded music sellers were, Roddy Ricch's debut album, Please Excuse Me for Being Antisocial, featuring the global smash, The Box, which spent 11 weeks at #1 in the U.S.; Dua Lipa's second album, Future Nostalgia, which saw her become the third most listened to artist on Spotify globally; and albums from 2 artists that we're pleased to work with across both recorded music and music publishing, multi-Grammy winner Lizzo and Australian sensation, Tones and I, whose global smash, Dance Monkey, crossed the 1 billion streams mark. On the international front, best sellers included Japan's Kobukuro and Korea's Twice. We also saw #1 chart success stories in multiple markets across the globe, including Ghali in Italy, [ Gondi ] in France and Capital Bra in Germany.\n At Warner Chappell, our momentum continues to build. With revenue up 8%, our songwriters contributed to every #1 song on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart this quarter, including Belly and Oscar Holter on the Weeknd's Blinding Lights and 30 Roc and Dat Boi Squeeze on Roddy Ricch's The Box. As mentioned earlier, our digital revenue was rising at a healthy pace. In light of streaming's continued growth, I'm happy to say that we recently renewed our licensing partnership with Spotify and we're looking forward to collaborating with them on impactful campaigns for our artists and songwriters and working together to grow the global industry.\n Against this backdrop, we're also pleased to see some recent legal decisions that help protect the value of music. Following the $1 billion verdict against Cox Communications in December, the majors continue to make progress in other ISP cases, including those against Grande, Charter, Bright House and RCN.\n Now I'd like to turn to the pandemic. It's certainly no secret that we're in uncharted territory, what one of my colleagues happily called business unusual. Right now, our priorities are to protect the health of our people and our company, sustain our artists' and songwriters' livelihoods and support the wider music ecosystem. Ultimately, we will come out of this awful situation having absorbed some valuable lessons while evolving into a company that's even stronger and more efficient.\n So what are we learning in this unprecedented environment? First and foremost, we're seeing how vital and important music is to people's daily lives. In difficult times like these, music can lift people's spirits, transport them and make them feel connected and safe. The global appetite for great music is higher than ever and will continue to expand. It's still early days, but we're seeing daily consumption patterns shifting to reflect people's new working-from-home reality. Initially, at least, we've not seen fundamental changes in the dynamic of the streaming subscription business which remains strong and healthy.\n Second, our A&R teams are demonstrating their ability to find new and imaginative ways to help and support our artists' and songwriters' creative processes even in the most challenging circumstances. Great talent always rises to the occasion in good times and bad, and incredible music is being written and recorded right now, not only about the crisis itself but about life, relationships and resiliency.\n Just a few examples. Atlantic artist and Warner Chappell songwriter, Alec Benjamin, released Six Feet Apart a moving song about social distancing. He recorded the vocals and guitar on his phone, and the track was written and produced over Face Time. The 2 members of Twenty One Pilots collaborated remotely on a fantastic new song and inventive video, Level of Concern. At Warner Chappell, they've responded by setting up a series of video dates between songwriters who've never met before. And in the midst of the pandemic, Warner Music Italy couldn't film the traditional video for their breakout superstar, Ghali. So they supported the artist's vision by organizing fans to sing the song from their homes and created a video with user-generated content that brought everyone together. We're also not missing a beat when it comes to attracting the next-generation of talent. We're already adept at negotiating and signing deals remotely and we're accelerating the adoption and use of our proprietary A&R tool, Sodatone, to identify emerging artists across the globe.\n Third, our ability to cut through all the noise on streaming services is more valuable than ever to our artists and songwriters. We pivoted quickly implementing imaginative solutions to not only compensate for the abrupt halt to live promotional appearances but to actually deepen the connections between artists and fans. Songkick, the world's leading gig discovery tool, which we acquired in 2017, has been at the forefront of this effort. They've staged a series of livestream gigs by artists such as France's Christophe Mae\u0301, the U.K.'s Rudimental and Sweden's Paul Rey to name just a few. And we continue to focus on moving into emerging markets to expand our reach for both global superstars and local talent.\n At the beginning of April, we unveiled our new office in Vietnam where they marked the opening in grand style by nailing the top 3 spots on the country's Spotify playlist. This follows our recent launch of operations in India and Turkey.\n None of us can be sure how long this situation is going to last. So we believe that besides supporting our people, our artists and our songwriters. Through this tough time, we need to help those less fortunate than ourselves. We've set aside a central multimillion-dollar fund to support both local and global COVID-related philanthropic efforts over an extended period of time. We're helping the fight against the virus by donating to groups such as the World Health Organization and Heart to Heart International.\n We're helping people across the music community, not only artists and songwriters in need of emergency aid, but also the wider ecosystem of technicians, session musicians, production crews and tour managers with donations to music-focused organizations such as use of MusiCares, the Health Musicians Fund, the Unison Fund, the Jazz Foundation and the Crexendo Trust.\n We're also supporting the efforts of our artists and songwriters to make a difference. One highlight was the hugely successful PlayOn Fest, a first-of-its-kind global virtual music festival presented by the Warner Music Group. Held over the last weekend of April, it benefited the World Health Organization's COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund.\n Right now, our global teams, our artists and our songwriters are proving just how flexible, endlessly creative and solution-driven they are. As I've noted in the past, we're the planet's only pure-play global music entertainment company. Both our scale and our nimbleness will serve us very well in the coming months as we keep the music flowing and fans engaged. I'm very optimistic that our distinctive combination of creative innovation and financial discipline will see us whether this storm and emerge stronger, better and more agile than ever.\n With that, I'll now turn it over to Eric."

At the request of Warner Music Group, today's call is being recorded for replay purposes. And if you object, you may disconnect at any time. [Operator Instructions] \n Now I would like to turn today's call over to your host, Mr. James Steven, Executive Vice President and Chief Communications Officer. You may begin. \nJames Steven: Good morning. Welcome to Warner Music Group's fiscal first quarter ended December 31, 2019, conference call. Both our earnings press release and the Form 10-Q we filed this morning are available on our website. \n Today, our CEO, Steve Cooper, will update you on our business performance and strategy; our Executive Vice President and CFO, Eric Levin, will discuss our financial condition and results; and then we will take your questions. \n Before Steve's comments, let me remind you that this communication includes forward-looking statements that reflect the current views of Warner Music Group about future events and financial performance. All forward-looking statements are made as of today, and we disclaim any duty to update such statements. Our expectations, beliefs and projections are expressed in good faith, and we believe there is a reasonable basis for them. However, there can be no assurance that management's expectations, beliefs and projections will result or be achieved. Investors should not rely on forward-looking statements because they are subject to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors that can cause actual results that differ materially from our expectations.\n Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in our earnings press release, our Form 10-Q and Form 10-K and other SEC filings. We plan to present certain non-GAAP results during this conference call. We have provided schedules reconciling these results to our GAAP results in our earnings press release posted on our website. Also please note that all revenue figures and comparisons discussed today will be presented in constant currency, unless otherwise noted. \n With that, I'll turn it over to Steve. \nStephen Cooper: Thanks, James. Happy New Year, everyone, and thanks for joining us. My comments today will be briefer than usual since we spoke 2 months ago. \n Our Q1 results were very strong. We achieved the highest revenue in our 16-year history as a stand-alone company. We're especially pleased with this, considering the tough comparison with our results in the prior year quarter. Specifically, we grew total revenue by 5%, digital revenue by 14% and OIBDA by 10%. \n Our results reflect the benefit of both our own execution and industry performance. Recorded Music continues to expand in both established and emerging markets. For calendar '19, consumption in the U.S. rose 15%, with streaming up 29%. In the U.K., album equivalent sales grew 7.5%, with streaming up 26%. All indications are that other major territories, particularly in Europe, will show strong performance figures when released over the coming weeks. But as we've said many times, we're not satisfied with merely keeping pace with the industry. We're determined to take advantage of our unique position. We are the planet's only pure-play global music entertainment company. We have the worldwide scale necessary to flourish in the streaming environment. We also have the agility and nimbleness required to capitalize on new opportunities and business models. The combination of our creative expertise and expanding global footprint, innovation mindset and financial discipline makes us very confident about our long-term growth prospects. \n Above all, our results this quarter are further evidence that our investment in a consistent flow of great music is paying off. Our top sellers reflected new talent, including Lizzo and Tones and I; hip-hop stars, such as Cardi B and Young Thug; legends, like Rod Stewart and Prince; and superstars, including Coldplay and Ed Sheeran, who was named Artist of the Decade by the U.K.'s Official Charts Company and whose single, Shape of You, was the most streamed song of the decade on Spotify. \n In order to turbocharge our A&R activity, we continue to build out the breadth and depth of our repertoire centers. One of the most recent examples is Elektra Music Group, which we established as a new stand-alone frontline U.S. label in the last fiscal year under Gregg Nadel and Mike Easterlin's leadership. Elektra's many early accomplishments include signing Tones and I, whose single, Dance Monkey, has had a 3-month run at #1 on Spotify's global chart. And in December, Elektra formed a joint venture with DTA Records, the label founded by Blink-182's Travis Barker, whose worked with groundbreakers, like Lil Nas X, Halsey and Pharrell. \n Our commitment to extending our global reach by adding to our local expertise clearly shows up in our results this quarter. Local stars like France's Renaud and Japan's WANIMA and TWICE featured high up on our list of top sellers, despite not yet having significant global fan bases. \n We're seeing incredible success with the new generation of local European artists who are helping drive streaming growth. These include Aya Nakamura in France, Bausa in Germany; and Fred De Palma, who ,with his 5x platinum single, Una Volta Ancora, celebrated Italy's biggest #1 single of 2019. \n We're always looking for imaginative ways to break into new markets and add to our existing presence, whether that's through organic investment, local partnerships or acquisitions. I'll give you 2 recent examples. \n At the beginning of the year, we opened new offices in Turkey, following the expansion of our partnership with the country's largest independent music company, Dogan.\n And at the end of last year, our Netherlands-based label, Spinnin', launched a nation imprint to capitalize on the popularity of new dance music coming out of the region. \n In Publishing, Warner Chappell songwriters are contributing to today's top hits. For example, Julia Michaels, Justin Tranter and Mattman & Robin cowrote Selena Gomez's Lose You to Love Me; Michael Pollack cowrote Maroon 5's Memories and Dre Moon cowrote The Weeknd's Heartless. Under the great leadership of Guy Moot and Carianne Marshall, Warner Chappell continues to build its roster of superstar songwriters. They've added breakthrough artists such as Lizzo, Tones and I and Ava Max to a roster that already includes Twenty One Pilots, Green Day, Wiley, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Katy Perry, George Michael and many, many more. \n Warner Chappell is also taking a more global outlook, signing a host of local songwriters from all corners of the world, including Vicente Barco from Columbia, Espina from Spain and Kim Jae-hwan from Korea. \n Our artists and songwriters had a great showing at the Grammys this past Sunday, with Lizzo and Gary Clark, Jr. each taking home 3. We congratulate all our winners who include Dan + Shay, Brandi Carlile, Nipsey Hussle, Anderson .Paak and the Hadestown cast recording. \n We're looking forward to the Brit Awards on February 18, where our artists and songwriters are up for a wide range of awards. \n Warner Chappell's Dave, and Atlantic and Warner Chappell's Stormzy led the pack for us with 4 and 3 nominations, respectively. Other Warner recording artists and songwriters up for a Brit include Burna Boy, Charli XCX, Foals, Lizzo, Mahalia and Rag'N'Bone Man. We wish them all the best of luck. \n Fiscal '20 is off to an excellent start, and there's lots of amazing new music on the horizon. Our partnerships with our digital distributors have never been better, we put the India litigation with Spotify behind us, and we're looking forward to working with all the streaming services to grow the industry and create new possibilities for artists and songwriters. \n One of our unwavering goals is to preserve and protect the value of music. While we expect an appeal, we are pleased that in December, a jury rendered a $1 billion verdict in the copyright infringement case brought by us, Sony and Universal against Cox Communications. This was the fifth largest U.S. jury award in 2019 and clearly demonstrates the juries understand piracy is not okay. We've brought similar industry cases against 4 other ISPs, Charter, Grande, RCN and Bright House, all of which should proceed to trial within the next 12 to 18 months. \n In short, given our critical role in the music ecosystem, we believe we've only just begun to realize the Warner Music Group's true potential as the global music entertainment powerhouse. \n I'll now turn the call over to Eric. \nEric Levin: Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results are very healthy, particularly in the context of a very strong prior year quarter. \n Revenue rose 5% in constant currency and 4% on an as-reported basis. From an OIBDA perspective, certain adjustments are necessary to make the year-over-year comparisons more meaningful. The details are in our press release. But in the quarter, we had $11 million of onetime expenses related to our financial system upgrade and restructuring and publishing associated with management changes. \n Q1 adjusted OIBDA rose 10% to $247 million, and adjusted OIBDA margin rose 1.1 percentage points to 19.7% driven by revenue growth and lower variable compensation expense. Variable compensation associated with our long-term incentive plan was a benefit of $2 million compared with an expense of $17 million in the prior year quarter due to the impact of dividends paid. Based on the valuation at quarter end, we expect the cash payout associated with the plan to be in the range of $250 million to $300 million spread mostly over fiscal '20 and fiscal '21. That said, we are in the process of evaluating what impact the Tencent investment in Universal could have on the current valuation and the resulting impacts to variable comp expense and future cash payouts. \n In Recorded Music, first quarter revenue was up 5%. On a segment basis, digital revenue grew 13% driven by a 19% increase in streaming. Physical revenue declined 19% due to industry trends and timing of releases. Licensing declined 1% due to timing of payments. Artist service and expanded rights revenue grew 14% driven by touring and advertising revenue. \n Recorded Music adjusted OIBDA rose 12% to $241 million driven by revenue growth and lower variable compensation expense. Adjusted OIBDA margin rose 1.5 percentage points to 22.2%. \n Q1 Music Publishing revenue grew 6%. Digital rose 12%. Performance declined 12% due to timing of distributions. Mechanicals, which only relate to physical sales, was flat. Sync rose 29% due to higher revenue from licensing for TV and commercials. \n Music Publishing adjusted OIBDA declined 13% or $5 million to $34 million. Adjusted OIBDA margin declined 3.9 percentage points to 19.7% due to timing of A&R investment. \n Our operating cash flow in Q1 was $78 million versus $92 million in the prior year quarter. The change was largely due to the timing of working capital. \n CapEx was $15 million compared to $26 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease was due to timing of our L.A. headquarter -- spend on our L.A. headquarters in the prior year quarter. For full year '20, we continue to expect our total CapEx of about $100 million due to anticipated spend on the upgrade of our financial systems. \n On January 17, we paid a dividend of $37.5 million as compared to our Q1 dividend of '19 of $31.25 million. We expect to pay the same $37.5 million dividend in each of Q2 and Q3. And consistent with our policy, we'll determine any potential variable dividend for Q4 at fiscal year-end. \n I am pleased with Q1 results and remain confident in our growth prospects for the full year. \n With that, operator, please open the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We do have a question from the line of David Farber from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. \nDavid Farber: I have a couple of questions. The way -- the business is obviously performing as you've talked about for a couple of quarters. But I wanted to touch base on just 2 items. The first on what you mentioned in the prepared remarks around Cox and some of the other cable operators. Can you kind of just give us a high-level sense for what the back and forth is around the $1 billion? Sort of just walk us through what's happening there because I think that would be helpful. And then I have a follow-up. \nEric Levin: I can... \nStephen Cooper: Yes, go ahead. \nEric Levin: Yes. So well, I would say that that's a jury ruling or judgment, which we're very pleased with. We do fully expect the likelihood of an appeal, and that process will move forward. We'll continue to pursue that case and the other ISP cases rigorously. But it could take time to go through the appeals process and the discussions that, that could bring up. So although we're pleased, we do expect a favorable outcome. We'll pursue rigorously. We realize we have to be patient given the judicial process. \nDavid Farber: Right. But what's the crux of the back and forth? Yes. \nStephen Cooper: Just to elaborate for a minute on Eric's response. The case was really the basis of a disregard for the DMCA and disregarding takedown and policing of their network for people that were pirating our intellectual property as well as Sony's and Universal. And there really is no back and forth. There were repeated requests to police and takedown, which were ignored. And it's similar in the other cases where, as I mentioned, we are determined to preserve the value of music, and we don't believe piracy is okay. I mean, that's really the back and the forth. \nDavid Farber: Right. I just didn't know if there were particular way that users you felt like were pirating via Cox or some of the other providers. \nEric Levin: Using things like BitTorrent, David. \nDavid Farber: Right. Okay. And then the other one that we get asked from time to time is just the fitness industry and sort of how that's evolving over time in terms of people using music and obviously your content. Do you have any thoughts there? And then I did want to touch upon some of the dot-coms that you mentioned as well. And that's it. \nEric Levin: Well, David, what I would say on fitness is fitness is one of a series of emerging opportunities that we think there's, what we'll call, traditional streaming, the services that people use to access the full library of music, which is wonderful. But there's also these emerging digital opportunities. Fitness is one. Various short-form social media forms are another and so on. As digital proliferates with new types of consumer services and products, these represent new growing areas where music will be consumed and areas of potential solid and incremental growth for us to license music. The various fitness services are services we do license our music to. We do monetize the platforms. We're thrilled they utilize our music. We look forward to more types of experimentation in new companies in addition to the big ones that we know of now emerging. And we'll continue to speak with them and license our music. \n David, did you have a follow-up? \nDavid Farber: Yes. My follow-up is just you touched upon it briefly, but I want to make sure I understand. On the valuation, so we're understanding, to the extent you think there's going to be, it sounded like somewhere between $250 million and $300 million of outflows over the next 2 years related to the valuation of the business, but just maybe help us with that. \nEric Levin: No, that's right. So the long-term incentive plan we have in place has a payout mechanism over the next -- this and the next fiscal year. Our current valuation is in the range that we described in that you just $250 million to $300 million. We also noted that with the Tencent Universal transaction, we will evaluate what impact that has going forward. And that is -- I think that's the summary. \nOperator: I'll now turn the call back to Steve Cooper for closing remarks. \nEric Levin: Okay. Well, this is Eric. Steve may be having a challenge with technology, but we thank everyone for joining the call. We look forward to speaking to everyone next quarter. And we hope everyone has a good rest of the winter, and we will speak to everyone soon. Thank you so much. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

But in the quarter, we had $11 million of onetime expenses related to our financial system upgrade and restructuring and publishing associated with management changes. \n Q1 adjusted OIBDA rose 10% to $247 million, and adjusted OIBDA margin rose 1.1 percentage points to 19.7% driven by revenue growth and lower variable compensation expense. Variable compensation associated with our long-term incentive plan was a benefit of $2 million compared with an expense of $17 million in the prior year quarter due to the impact of dividends paid. Based on the valuation at quarter end, we expect the cash payout associated with the plan to be in the range of $250 million to $300 million spread mostly over fiscal '20 and fiscal '21. That said, we are in the process of evaluating what impact the Tencent investment in Universal could have on the current valuation and the resulting impacts to variable comp expense and future cash payouts. \n In Recorded Music, first quarter revenue was up 5%. On a segment basis, digital revenue grew 13% driven by a 19% increase in streaming. Physical revenue declined 19% due to industry trends and timing of releases. Licensing declined 1% due to timing of payments. Artist service and expanded rights revenue grew 14% driven by touring and advertising revenue. \n Recorded Music adjusted OIBDA rose 12% to $241 million driven by revenue growth and lower variable compensation expense. Adjusted OIBDA margin rose 1.5 percentage points to 22.2%. \n Q1 Music Publishing revenue grew 6%. Digital rose 12%. Performance declined 12% due to timing of distributions. Mechanicals, which only relate to physical sales, was flat. Sync rose 29% due to higher revenue from licensing for TV and commercials. \n Music Publishing adjusted OIBDA declined 13% or $5 million to $34 million. Adjusted OIBDA margin declined 3.9 percentage points to 19.7% due to timing of A&R investment. \n Our operating cash flow in Q1 was $78 million versus $92 million in the prior year quarter. The change was largely due to the timing of working capital. \n CapEx was $15 million compared to $26 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease was due to timing of our L.A. headquarter -- spend on our L.A. headquarters in the prior year quarter. For full year '20, we continue to expect our total CapEx of about $100 million due to anticipated spend on the upgrade of our financial systems. \n On January 17, we paid a dividend of $37.5 million as compared to our Q1 dividend of '19 of $31.25 million. We expect to pay the same $37.5 million dividend in each of Q2 and Q3. And consistent with our policy, we'll determine any potential variable dividend for Q4 at fiscal year-end. \n I am pleased with Q1 results and remain confident in our growth prospects for the full year. \n With that, operator, please open the line for questions. I can... Yes. So well, I would say that that's a jury ruling or judgment, which we're very pleased with. We do fully expect the likelihood of an appeal, and that process will move forward. We'll continue to pursue that case and the other ISP cases rigorously. But it could take time to go through the appeals process and the discussions that, that could bring up. So although we're pleased, we do expect a favorable outcome. We'll pursue rigorously. We realize we have to be patient given the judicial process. Using things like BitTorrent, David. Well, David, what I would say on fitness is fitness is one of a series of emerging opportunities that we think there's, what we'll call, traditional streaming, the services that people use to access the full library of music, which is wonderful. But there's also these emerging digital opportunities. Fitness is one. Various short-form social media forms are another and so on. As digital proliferates with new types of consumer services and products, these represent new growing areas where music will be consumed and areas of potential solid and incremental growth for us to license music. The various fitness services are services we do license our music to. We do monetize the platforms. We're thrilled they utilize our music. We look forward to more types of experimentation in new companies in addition to the big ones that we know of now emerging. And we'll continue to speak with them and license our music. \n David, did you have a follow-up? No, that's right. So the long-term incentive plan we have in place has a payout mechanism over the next -- this and the next fiscal year. Our current valuation is in the range that we described in that you just $250 million to $300 million. We also noted that with the Tencent Universal transaction, we will evaluate what impact that has going forward. And that is -- I think that's the summary. Okay. Well, this is Eric. Steve may be having a challenge with technology, but we thank everyone for joining the call. We look forward to speaking to everyone next quarter. And we hope everyone has a good rest of the winter, and we will speak to everyone soon. Thank you so much."

            "name": "Stephen Cooper",
            "content": "Thanks, James. Happy New Year, everyone, and thanks for joining us. My comments today will be briefer than usual since we spoke 2 months ago. \n Our Q1 results were very strong. We achieved the highest revenue in our 16-year history as a stand-alone company. We're especially pleased with this, considering the tough comparison with our results in the prior year quarter. Specifically, we grew total revenue by 5%, digital revenue by 14% and OIBDA by 10%. \n Our results reflect the benefit of both our own execution and industry performance. Recorded Music continues to expand in both established and emerging markets. For calendar '19, consumption in the U.S. rose 15%, with streaming up 29%. In the U.K., album equivalent sales grew 7.5%, with streaming up 26%. All indications are that other major territories, particularly in Europe, will show strong performance figures when released over the coming weeks. But as we've said many times, we're not satisfied with merely keeping pace with the industry. We're determined to take advantage of our unique position. We are the planet's only pure-play global music entertainment company. We have the worldwide scale necessary to flourish in the streaming environment. We also have the agility and nimbleness required to capitalize on new opportunities and business models. The combination of our creative expertise and expanding global footprint, innovation mindset and financial discipline makes us very confident about our long-term growth prospects. \n Above all, our results this quarter are further evidence that our investment in a consistent flow of great music is paying off. Our top sellers reflected new talent, including Lizzo and Tones and I; hip-hop stars, such as Cardi B and Young Thug; legends, like Rod Stewart and Prince; and superstars, including Coldplay and Ed Sheeran, who was named Artist of the Decade by the U.K.'s Official Charts Company and whose single, Shape of You, was the most streamed song of the decade on Spotify. \n In order to turbocharge our A&R activity, we continue to build out the breadth and depth of our repertoire centers. One of the most recent examples is Elektra Music Group, which we established as a new stand-alone frontline U.S. label in the last fiscal year under Gregg Nadel and Mike Easterlin's leadership. Elektra's many early accomplishments include signing Tones and I, whose single, Dance Monkey, has had a 3-month run at #1 on Spotify's global chart. And in December, Elektra formed a joint venture with DTA Records, the label founded by Blink-182's Travis Barker, whose worked with groundbreakers, like Lil Nas X, Halsey and Pharrell. \n Our commitment to extending our global reach by adding to our local expertise clearly shows up in our results this quarter. Local stars like France's Renaud and Japan's WANIMA and TWICE featured high up on our list of top sellers, despite not yet having significant global fan bases. \n We're seeing incredible success with the new generation of local European artists who are helping drive streaming growth. These include Aya Nakamura in France, Bausa in Germany; and Fred De Palma, who ,with his 5x platinum single, Una Volta Ancora, celebrated Italy's biggest #1 single of 2019. \n We're always looking for imaginative ways to break into new markets and add to our existing presence, whether that's through organic investment, local partnerships or acquisitions. I'll give you 2 recent examples. \n At the beginning of the year, we opened new offices in Turkey, following the expansion of our partnership with the country's largest independent music company, Dogan.\n And at the end of last year, our Netherlands-based label, Spinnin', launched a nation imprint to capitalize on the popularity of new dance music coming out of the region. \n In Publishing, Warner Chappell songwriters are contributing to today's top hits. For example, Julia Michaels, Justin Tranter and Mattman & Robin cowrote Selena Gomez's Lose You to Love Me; Michael Pollack cowrote Maroon 5's Memories and Dre Moon cowrote The Weeknd's Heartless. Under the great leadership of Guy Moot and Carianne Marshall, Warner Chappell continues to build its roster of superstar songwriters. They've added breakthrough artists such as Lizzo, Tones and I and Ava Max to a roster that already includes Twenty One Pilots, Green Day, Wiley, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Katy Perry, George Michael and many, many more. \n Warner Chappell is also taking a more global outlook, signing a host of local songwriters from all corners of the world, including Vicente Barco from Columbia, Espina from Spain and Kim Jae-hwan from Korea. \n Our artists and songwriters had a great showing at the Grammys this past Sunday, with Lizzo and Gary Clark, Jr. each taking home 3. We congratulate all our winners who include Dan + Shay, Brandi Carlile, Nipsey Hussle, Anderson .Paak and the Hadestown cast recording. \n We're looking forward to the Brit Awards on February 18, where our artists and songwriters are up for a wide range of awards. \n Warner Chappell's Dave, and Atlantic and Warner Chappell's Stormzy led the pack for us with 4 and 3 nominations, respectively. Other Warner recording artists and songwriters up for a Brit include Burna Boy, Charli XCX, Foals, Lizzo, Mahalia and Rag'N'Bone Man. We wish them all the best of luck. \n Fiscal '20 is off to an excellent start, and there's lots of amazing new music on the horizon. Our partnerships with our digital distributors have never been better, we put the India litigation with Spotify behind us, and we're looking forward to working with all the streaming services to grow the industry and create new possibilities for artists and songwriters. \n One of our unwavering goals is to preserve and protect the value of music. While we expect an appeal, we are pleased that in December, a jury rendered a $1 billion verdict in the copyright infringement case brought by us, Sony and Universal against Cox Communications. This was the fifth largest U.S. jury award in 2019 and clearly demonstrates the juries understand piracy is not okay. We've brought similar industry cases against 4 other ISPs, Charter, Grande, RCN and Bright House, all of which should proceed to trial within the next 12 to 18 months. \n In short, given our critical role in the music ecosystem, we believe we've only just begun to realize the Warner Music Group's true potential as the global music entertainment powerhouse. \n I'll now turn the call over to Eric. Yes, go ahead. Just to elaborate for a minute on Eric's response. The case was really the basis of a disregard for the DMCA and disregarding takedown and policing of their network for people that were pirating our intellectual property as well as Sony's and Universal. And there really is no back and forth. There were repeated requests to police and takedown, which were ignored. And it's similar in the other cases where, as I mentioned, we are determined to preserve the value of music, and we don't believe piracy is okay. I mean, that's really the back and the forth."

At the request of Warner Music Group, today's call is being recorded for replay purposes and if you object you may disconnect at any time. Now I would like to turn today's call over to your host, Kareem Chin, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nKareem Chin: Good morning, everyone.

And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve.\nSteve Cooper: Thanks Kareem. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As we all know, the world has been through a very dark time over the last 18 months. We've all been challenged both personally and professionally in ways we could not have imagined. But with vaccination rates continuing to rise and many territories beginning to return to some kind of normality, it feels like there is light at the end of the proverbial tunnel. If there's anything that our company has learned during this pandemic, it's that for billions of people across the globe music is essential to our well-being. It permeates our lives and gives us inspiration and hope. It gives voice to our anxiety, our sadness and our joy. In short, music touches our hearts like no art form. When concerts and live appearances were nearly impossible to stage, our ability to super serve our artists and songwriters during this extraordinary time was made crystal clear. Our global resources, creative expertise and commercial reach make us an absolutely indispensable component that is critical to the entire music value chain. Six years ago, Warner doubled down onstream. We became the first music major to make it our largest revenue source. Today our business is no longer driven by linear format shifts, it's multifaceted and expanding in all directions, from social media to gaming and home fitness to VR, we're at the heart of virtually every consumer experience. The increasing complexity of our industry goes hand-in-hand with the ever-growing potential of our company. We're not merely embracing our future, we're creating it. With that let's get to an overview of our fourth quarter results. Total revenue increased by 22% on an as reported basis and 21% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA was up by 34% with margin improvement driven by strong revenue growth. In Recorded Music, revenue increased by more than 21%, digital grew 17% and streaming grew 20%. Meanwhile, revenue sources that were severely impacted by COVID, most notably artist services and physical recovered nicely growing 70% and 22%, respectively. In Publishing, we delivered revenue growth of over 19%. Digital, mechanical and sync, all had double-digit growth. It was also very good news that performance revenue appears to have bottomed out and has returned to modest growth as consumer venues across the board continue to recover. As new capital force into our sector, we're even more confident in our position. We have the expertise and capabilities to increase market share, not merely the financial resources to buy it. We're highly selective and only pursue deals that through our active management of assets will be accretive to shareholder value. Our track record of making financially disciplined investments is evidenced by the rate at which we convert adjusted OIBDA to free cash flow. Now let me drill down into the key tenets of our business with a few examples of the progress we're making. While taste trends and tech will change, artists and songwriters will always be our driving force. We pride ourselves on our ability to work with talent at all stages of their careers and across a wide diversity of genres generations and geographies. We're developing and nurturing the next generation of recording artists such as the UK's Tim Ambrose and Joel Chords, Argentina's Lit Killah and the US is Don Toliver, whose album debuted, number one on the top album sales chart at Billboard. We're also trusted by iconic recording artists to manage their life's work. In just the last several months, we struck careers expanding deals with Coldplay Madonna David Guetta and the estate of David Bowie. On the publishing side, big signings include German Rapper RIN, R&B Star Jhene Aiko, Rock Legend William Patrick Corgan and Grammy Award winner Daniel Caesar. We also welcome pop icon Sam Smith for a joint publishing agreement with Tim & Danny Music. Many artists also see the value in having Warner as their home for both recorded music and publishing. Led Zeppelin, Bruno Mars, Madonna, Saweetie, Tones and I Cardi, B and Lizzo, to name just a few. While our artists and songwriters are at the center of all that we do, genius really does need come. More than ever, talent needs help to cut through the noise. Our mission is to elevate great artists, amplify their music and help their voices move the world. Music is the only true global language and I'm a big believer in the principle that success can come from anywhere and translate everywhere. Simultaneously, music is becoming hyper-localized in Japan, Germany and France, the three biggest non-Anglo markets, domestic repertoires on average over 65% of the business. We're now operating in over 70 countries and expanding our resources and reach, in a number of key growth markets. In the past year alone, we've made a number of strategic moves to strengthen our A&R presence across the globe. We've launched Atlantic Records in both Russia and Benelux. And ADA, our Indie Label Services Group expanded into Russia and as well as Italy. We continued our expansion into Africa by acquiring leading independent label Coleske. We further expanded our Asian and Chinese footprint with our hip-hop labels Asiatic and JUUICE and our dance label Whet. And we forged an important new alliance with Rotana music, the Arab world's leading independent label. We also established through local Warner companies and ADA important distribution partnerships with KRU in Malaysia, Sky Digital in India and Orfe\u00f3n Videovox and world wide records in Mexico, Baramey in Cambodia, Yin Yang Media in Vietnam and Same Sane Records in Australia. Here's a great example of our strategy and action. We signed Nigerian artist CKay to Warner Music South Africa. After he was discovered through our partnership with Chocolate City, in an unprecedented achievement, CKay history by scoring the most watched music video in the world on YouTube with his song, Love Nwantiti. The biggest song to ever come out of Africa, this is also one of the most popular tracks on Instagram and TikTok and also on Spotify where it now has over 180 million streams. Bloomberg recently took note of this calling it a watership moment for African pop. Let's now turn to our progress with innovation and revenue diversification. Not so long ago people questioned the outlook for streaming growth. Today it's clear from our results that subscription streaming still has tremendous runway ahead of it, bolstered by price increases in developed markets and increasing penetration in emerging markets. That growth is being supplemented by emerging platforms that are incorporating music as a critical feature of their user experiences. To that end, we're positioning ourselves at the intersection of social, gaming, fitness VR and music. We continue to lead this sector by being the first major to partner with disruptive players in these dynamic and rapidly growing spaces. In another pioneering move, we are to date the only music major to port a partnership with Twitch, paving the way for even greater collaboration in the future. We've also continued to grow our own unique network of consumer media brands including; IMGN, UPROXX, Songkick and HipHopDX. We've expanded our reach through the development of outlets such as the Pit and Indie mix tape and we continue to manage nearly 5000 unique artist, YouTube channels. As a result, our ad base revenue grew significantly in Q4 with sustained gains across these owned and operated properties. Our network of consumer media brands is a strategic focus for us and has significant growth potential. Beyond the lookout for an exciting announcement later this week which will tell you how we intend to further turbocharge this area. None of this however is possible without great people in place to make it all happen. We continue to strengthen our executive branch promoting from within as well as hiring great talent from the outside. Over the past year we've installed our next-generation of digital savvy leadership in many key territories. These include Canada, China, Germany, France, Latin America, South Africa, Poland, the Philippines, Taiwan and Indonesia. We also have a new leader of ADA Worldwide along with separate US and international ADA heads making us even more capable of serving indie artist and labels everywhere. Without a doubt, we have the best team in the business one that positions us exceptionally well for this new golden age in music. With our new Head of ESG in place since August, we plan to issue our first annual report in early 2022. It will provide a detailed update on our progress in sustainability and DEI among other topics. This past June, we published our first impact report from the Warner Music Group, Blavatnik Family Foundation Social Justice Fund. Established last year the fund has focused its grant making on three key pillars: education, criminal justice reform and arts and culture. It's already committed funds and resources to a number of amazing organizations with many more brands on the way. Fiscal year '22 is already off to a strong start. Coldplay's new album was their ninth number 1 in the UK, while Ed Sheeran has the fastest selling album in 2021 so far. Silk Sonic with Bruno Mars and Anderson, Paak duo dropped their new album an evening with Silk Sonic, Last Friday. We also have an amazing slate of holiday releases from Kelly Clarkson, Michael Bubl\u00e9, Sia, Rob Thomas, Brett Eldredge and others. In today's detention economy, our business not only demands an ever-increasing flow of great music, but also ever-growing levels of service to great artists and songwriters. Warner achieved staff mix better than any other company in the world, and we look forward to raising the bar even further in the coming year and beyond. Before I turn it over to Lou, there is one final matter I'd like to mention. While major music companies such as Warner Chappell negotiated direct licenses with streaming services in the United States, there is a portion of the revenue from traditional audio streaming services, specifically mechanical revenue, which is subject to a compulsory license at rates set by the Copyright Royalty Board. You may have read about Formal Records IV, which is the name of the ongoing US digital Mechanical Royalty Rate proceeding Web IV, the CRB. It will determine what music publishers and songwriters will be paid by these traditional services between 2023 and 2027. There's been a lot of controversy in the music press on this topic, but there should be nothing controversial about music publishers and songwriters getting paid, the fair market rates to which they're entitled. We fight hard for the rights of our songwriters. Songs and songwriters are at the very beginning of the fast value chain and there would be no music business without them. We fully support the NMPA's advocacy efforts in the current rate proceeding and we look forward to a positive outcome from Warner Chappell Music and its songwriters. And with that, I'll turn it over to Lou.\nLou Dickler: Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. 2021 was an incredibly challenging year to navigate and our results only continue to validate the strength and resilience of our business model. In Q4, total revenue was up approximately 21% on a constant currency basis, and up over 22% on an as-reported basis. These results are underpinned by growth across almost all of our revenue lines. For the full year, our total revenue increased by over 15% on a constant currency basis and almost 19% on an as-reported basis. Our strong operating performance was evidenced by the healthy growth in adjusted OIBDA, and adjusted EBITDA we saw in both the fourth quarter and the full year. In Q4 adjusted OIBDA increased by over 25% to $218 million, with margins improving from 15.5% to 15.8%. Adjusted EBITDA, which reflects the pro forma impact of future cost savings and transactions completed in the quarter increased by 34% to $237 million with margins improving from 15.7% to 17.2%. I want to note that, both metrics reflect adjustments for approximately $15 million of restructuring costs, primarily driven by severance costs associated with the leadership and related organizational changes that Steve referenced earlier. For the full year, adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EBITDA increased by approximately 29% and 30% respectively. You can find the calculations and reconciliations related to adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EBITDA in our press release. Recorded Music revenue increased by over 21% in the fourth quarter. Residual revenue increased by 17% driven by continued strength in streaming revenue which grew approximately 20% year-over-year. All components of streaming revenue experienced robust year-over-year growth. Recorded Music revenue from emerging streaming platforms remain at $235 million on an annualized basis, but pre-meaningfully year-over-year. As we have said previously, we expect the growth cadence from this revenue source to near the timing of significant new deals and renewals with scaled platforms. We also saw meaningful recovery in several of our revenue streams that were impacted by COVID. Artist services and expanded rights revenue which includes merchandising grew by 70%, reflecting an increase in merchandising and concert promotion revenue as touring has resumed. Physical revenue grew by 22%, primarily driven by the strong demand for vinyl across the globe. Licensing revenue declined 9%, mainly due to onetime licensing settlements in the prior year, partially offset by higher synchronization revenue as businesses continue to recover from COVID destruction. Adjusted OIBDA was $204 million, a 27% increase over the prior year quarter with margins improving to 17.4%. This growth was driven by higher overall revenue some of which came from recovering lower-margin areas like artist services, resulting in more muted margin. For the full year, Recorded Music revenue increased by 16% driven by growth across almost all revenue streams. Adjusted OIBDA increased by 29% with margin improving by 1.7 percentage points to 21.5%. Music Publishing revenue increased by over 19% in Q4 reflecting growth across all of its components. This performance was led by digital revenue growth of around 19% and driven by the continuing growth in streaming across traditional and emerging platforms. Digital revenue growth in the quarter was impacted by a favorable onetime settlement in the prior year quarter. There was also a shift in the collection of writer share of US digital performance income for certain digital service providers, which will affect the next couple of quarters. The impact of this change is a reduction in our revenue offset by a reduction in our writers' royalty expense resulting in a modest benefit to our margin. Sync revenue increased due to higher motion picture and commercial income and a onetime licensing settlement. Mechanical and Performance revenue increased as businesses continue to recover from COVID disruption with mechanical which only covers physical sales benefited from an increase in new sales. Music Publishing adjusted OIBDA increased 14% to $49 million, while margin decreased 1.5 percentage points to 23.9%. For the full year, Music Publishing revenue increased by 13% and adjusted OIBDA increased by 12% with margin declining from 24.4% to 23.5%. For both Q4 and the full year, the decline in adjusted OIBDA margin was attributable to revenue mix including the COVID impact to higher-margin performance revenue. Operating cash flow increased 30% to $228 million and 38% to $638 million for Q4 and the full year, respectively. We have revised our free cash flow definition to be more aligned with how we evaluate the operating performance of the business and to better reflect cash flow available for acquisitions, investments and return to shareholders. Going forward references to free cash flow will be calculated as operating cash flow minus CapEx. On this basis our free cash flow grew 39% to $192 million in Q4 and 44% to $545 million for the full year. This translates to an impressive free cash flow conversion rate defined as the ratio of adjusted OIBDA to free cash flow of 89% and 54% for Q4 and the full year, respectively. These metrics underscore the strong operating performance within our business as well as our financially disciplined ROI-focused investment strategy. CapEx in Q4 was $35 million compared to $37 million in the prior year quarter and $93 million for the full year compared to $85 million in the prior year. The increase was related to our previously announced transformation initiatives. Looking ahead to 2022, we expect to see elevated CapEx in the range of $130 million to $135 million for the full year. This increase is due to the continued investment in our IT and finance infrastructure as well as the expansion of EMP's facilities to address the strong demand in our e-commerce business. Our financial transformation program remains on track and is expected to deliver annualized run rate savings of about $35 million to $40 million once fully implemented in 2023. As of September 30, we had a cash balance of $499 million total debt of $3.3 billion and net debt of $2.8 billion. Since our IPO, we have actively managed our capital structure reducing our weighted average cost of debt from 4% to 3.2% and extending maturities with our nearest maturity date now in 2028. As we look ahead to the rest of the year, our expectations for total revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth rates remain largely in line with our internal expectations at the time of the IPO. While there will be some variability in revenue mix driven in part by recovery in certain COVID impacted revenue streams, we continue to be very optimistic about our long-term growth and have a high degree of confidence in our margin targets. We are truly excited about the steady flow of great music we have in store and look forward to an amazing rest of the year. Thank you for joining our call today and we will now open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Morris with Guggenheim. Your line is open. \nMichael Morris: Thank you very much. Good morning, guys. Two topics for me. I think, first, Steve can you talk a bit about the general trends that you're seeing in A&R costs? The deals seem to be getting more expensive and royalty advances I think are reflecting that. Can you just share with us what you think is driving that? And then my second topic, I think I'll direct to Lou just because you spoke about this. It's really about the runway for these emerging platform digital partnerships going forward. As you start to lap some of the initial deals, how should we think about the financial path there? Did those initial deals have certain minimum guarantees that could be at risk as you renew, or should we think about the growth opportunity more, driven by a combination of both usage and expansion of these deals? Thanks, guys.\nSteve Cooper: Great. So Michael, on the first one, A&R trends, I think it's important to remember that we manage a portfolio and as artists move from the initial stages of their career to really an established artists to either regional or global superstars, the cost does increase. That cost is generally however offset by reduced marketing and promotional expense as artists become better and better known. I think that given the financial resources that are flowing into both the Recorded Music and the music publishing markets, that the goal for Warner is to not get wrapped up in the exuberance in the market for lack of a better term and maintain our financial discipline that has been in place since the acquisition of Warner by Access. We are very thoughtful about how we allocate capital and what we put into any deal. Whether it be an artist or M&A, we are very thoughtful about not buying market share loss and we are very thoughtful about structuring deals to ensure that we get what we believe to be appropriate returns on our investments. You'll also see that our A&R budgets, marketing and promotional budgets have remained in relatively sticky, the same relationship with revenue over the last four, five, six years and we expect that to continue. That is a stable relationship but may in our marketing and promotion to revenue for the foreseeable future Michael.\nLou Dickler: With regard to the ESP question, Michael. And as we mentioned, the revenue for this streaming is recognized on a step basis not linear and that's due to the timing of the deal renegotiations. The deals are often structured as buyout versus consumption and as a result, you see that revenue impact. We do believe that as the services scale and new services come online in this space that the economic's looking to improve and we're seeing revenue growth.\nMichael Morris: Great. Thank you both. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kutgun Maral with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nKutgun Maral: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. And of course, best wishes to Eric. I hope he gets well soon. I was hoping to get your perspective on Universal. Their public listing has increased investor awareness and focused on the Recorded Music and Music publishing side of the audio ecosystem and seems to be driving a better appreciation of the attractive dynamics of the industry overall. But I guess on your end, has the UMG spin out effected Warner Music Group if at all? And maybe second, can you talk a bit about their margin profile compared to yours? And maybe why their margins appear higher? Thank you.\nSteve Cooper: So, I'll take the first part of that then Lou will take the second part. I think that Universal's IPO was good news not only for the broad music sector but content specifically, because to your point it has with content in a brighter spotlight and it's made the investor community more aware of the opportunities by way of investing on the content side of the music sector. We've competed with them, successfully for decades. And we wish them all success possible with respect to this launch. Lou will talk about some of the differences, when you look at margins. But what I will point out is -- and Lou will explain it to you our margins are essentially identical and we do that with essentially half the operating leverage.\nLou Dickler: Yeah. So as Steve mentioned, there is not a difference between our margin and UMG's margin on an apples-to-apples basis. They're nearly identical. Under IFRS Universal was able to classify certain rent and lease costs as depreciation which is excluded from EBITDA. If you net out the impact of that rent expense differential, as we noted our margins are nearly identical and Steve pointed out, slightly increased in greater sale.\nKutgun Maral: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Uerkwitz with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: Hey thank you. I am hoping you hear me. I have two questions, I'll ask at the same time. Steve you talked earlier about, new opportunities whether it's metaverse NFTs and whatnot. Everyone else on the earnings call has been talking about this quarter. You guys I believe have invested pretty early in this space. So one, could you kind of talk about the broad opportunities to hear on how audio plays, a role of -- music and audio play a role? And then, secondly, are there specific areas here that you think are more exciting than others? Thank you.\nSteve Cooper: Okay. Well, what we see Andrew, are really new models emerging every day. And I don't see any reason, why each new models, whether it be in social, gaming, fitness, other areas aren't going to continue to emerge. Almost all of them utilize music is one of the critical elements of building out their models and frankly underlying their success. I personally, couldn't imagine a time without music or a hip-hop without music. So when we looked at these new emerging opportunities which are showing up all around the world, they present tremendous possibilities for Warner. They're very exciting. These start-ups, we love to invest in them. We love to work with them to build these businesses to scale. And I think our drive and our ability to just diversify revenue will just continue. With respect to where do I think things are really going to get more interesting and more special. Most of the models we currently see are the traditional push-pull, where we push to the models, the models pushed to consumers, and consumers pull through the music that we help differentiate from much of the white noise that's uploaded these days into the services. I think with the -- within these large-scale metaverses Fortnite, Roblox and others that we will begin to see an opportunity where providing content and distribution convergence Andrew. And when you begin to look at the global reach the number of people that spend meaningful amounts of time in these new worlds I think it provides a universe of opportunity for Warner.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: Got it. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nBen Swinburne: Thank you. Good morning. Steve you made a comment in your prepared remarks that Warner strives or can drive market share without buying it. I think there was a phrase we used. Can you talk a little bit about how you guys do that specifically as we think about a market where there's more and more capital maintaining all this IP. And then I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you want to do with your free cash flow and leverage because I think given the strong free cash flow this year and looking into fiscal 2022 you guys are going to have a leverage level at least on a net basis that's relatively low compared to how you've sort of capitalized the company in the past. So, as we think about the next couple of years what might you guys do with your balance sheet or capital allocation that might optimize the balance sheet? Thank you.\nSteve Cooper: Right. So, what I've actually said about market share Ben is we won't acquire it at a loss. The way we will continue to maintain and grow our market share is through our investment strategies which really we invest broadly speaking in the four buckets and then I'll swing back to those that all four of them actually influence market share. First, we invest in our core business and we do that both through an expansion of our A&R budget in line with the growth of our revenue and through M&A and in the publishing sites primarily through the acquisition of catalogs. We are and have been making a concerted effort to invest in diversification of revenue which is bucket number two. Bucket number three is innovation and technology and bucket four is in our people. So, all of those over time impact our ability to build and gain market share, specifically with money flowing into the sector -- lots of money flowing into this sector we are -- because of the fact that we live in this sector oftentimes have more insight and a better view of what assets can and as importantly what they can't do by way of being turbocharged. Our organization are experts that I think the best in the world at turbocharging these sort of assets. So, when we look at them we look at them to see how we can create that turbocharging what headroom do we believe we have and how through financial discipline we are prepared to either price and/or restructure companies to achieve those ROI goals. We are very selective. We are certainly not going to be one of the lemons going over a cliff by spending unwisely and thinking that without the organization and the expertise these assets are going to grow through sub mystical or magical formulation. So, that's on the first piece. On the second piece, we've been very clear about what we do with our free cash flow. Our first priority is to invest in the business again with rigorous discipline to get the ROIs that we believe our shareholders deserve. The second is when we can't find those opportunities is to return capital to our shareholders. The third is to pay down debt. With respect to the third we haven't gotten to that intersection yet then and I don't see us getting there for the foreseeable future.\nBen Swinburne: Right. Can I just ask Lou one quick housekeeping on the streaming growth? I think you said 20%. Was there any currency impact, or maybe if you have that number ex-currency would be interested?\nLou Dickler: Yeah, Ben, it's not material. It's 1% or 2%.\nBen Swinburne: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Thornton with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nMatthew Thornton: Hey, good morning, guys. Steve, maybe two for you. I guess first I'm wondering if you can comment on kind of what's going on over in the UK with the CMA there opening up a market study of the industry. Just kind of curious your thoughts as the implications and maybe just how that plays out and any implications for Warner? And then just secondly, I know you guys don't provide formal guidance, but maybe just a little more high-level color as to how you're thinking about fiscal 2022 drivers or linearity or anything else that's kind of catching your attention for the upcoming year? Thanks guys.\nSteve Cooper: Okay. First of all, on the UK study, we believe what it's going to show is that on the content side and we should keep in mind that that study is going to look at the music section, not only content providers, but DSPs. But on the content side, we have a fiercely, fiercely competitive industry, where artists and songwriters have historically have today and will tomorrow have the benefit of fierce competition between the labels to land both recording artists and songwriters and I think that the fact that we have such a competitive environment, it will show that songwriters and recording artists are the primary beneficiaries of that composition. And their compositions are the benefits of that competition. So I'm confident that that will be a finding. I think that the -- I think that the review or the investigation will also show that our artists in our roaster and the way we select those artists and songwriters to join us and then what we do by way of marketing and promotion will show that streaming has been in general very good to them. I think it will also show that the availability of tools for DIY artists today by way of being able to professionally sound mix and distribute their music has never been greater. So I'm confident that when somebody looks at the music ecosphere from a purely factual objective point of view that people will finally realize and people will come to the conclusion that the labels are actually the good guys not the bad guys. On guidance, as you noted, we don't give guidance. That being said, our music in the market at the moment, the music that's coming some of our biggest artists are dropping music as we speak, I'm confident that the momentum we generated over the last three, six, nine, 12 months will continue.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America Securities. Your line is open.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you. I have two topics or two questions. First, what do you think drove the renaissance in physical? And do you think that will continue? On that topic could you talk about the difference in margins, which we know are lower, but what is the differential with physical versus digital? And then second, Steve, you called out air-based revenue and I guess as opposed to subscription or direct sales, can you talk about the size of your ad base revenue now? What the growth rate is and outlook for that part of your revenue is?\nSteve Cooper: Sure. Okay. So let me just quickly talk about the renaissance of physical and then I'll turn it over to Lou on both the comparisons of margins and the outlook for growth of ad base revenue. There is a segment of people around the world that love vinyl. It is the recordings in and of themselves are an art form. The album art, the notes, the lyrics, the way it's put together represents a work of art and a work of art from these incredible musical geniuses. So this segment of the music loving population loves vinyl, loves to collect it and we think it is that we'll continue to grow. The constraint being the ability to actually produce vinyl given the limited amount of capacity around the globe. Incidentally, vinyl just per se collecting it is for many people something that's really cool, and for what it's worth, I think, they're right and Lou will now walk you through the numbers.\nLou Dickler: Yes. So, on the margin differential between physical and digital, the difference is roughly 15% better margin on the streaming side. And then what was the second question is with regard to ad revenue?\nSteve Cooper: How we see ad revenue?\nLou Dickler: Yes. So, ad revenue continues to grow nicely. Obviously, COVID did have an impact on digital advertising revenue that seems recovered. Then that's business for us if you look at DSP, UPROXX, Songkick, IMGN as social publishers combined revenues for that about $100 million in the quarter relative size.\nSteve Cooper: Did that answer your question? \nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thanks. Good luck.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rich Greenfield with LightShed Partners. Your line is open. Rich, your line is open. Please check your mute button.\nRich Greenfield: Hi. Sorry about that. Can you hear me now?\nSteve Cooper: Yes.\nRich Greenfield: Sorry about that Steven. So the -- if I think about ad-supported streaming for many years there was sort of a -- I'd say the industry just didn't like ad-supported streaming and really just saw it as either an on-ramp to subscription streaming and many labels -- I won't speak specifically for you, but for many labels they wanted to sort of shut it down or force everybody into pure subscription streaming. Today it seems like the ad-supported side of the business is floating. I've never seen Spotify and Daniel Ek, so excited about ad-supported side of their business as they have been over the last couple of quarters. I'm curious sort of what are your thoughts on the growth of the ad-supported side of their business, and whether you're encouraging some of your other partners who don't have an ad-supported business to follow them?\nSteve Cooper: Well, first of all, we've always been of the view that people can pay for music either with their time or with currency. I guess, in an ad-supported business their time is the currency; and on the subscription side, money is the currency. So we've always been supportive of both. We in our discussions with DSPs always encourage them to look at revenue generating possibilities to strengthen both their businesses and our business. I think that, when you look at the way digital ad revenue has bounced back, the way it grew during the pandemic, we see others jumping into it, Rich. But we like all forms of revenue that support the music sector and ultimately flow to our artists into us. So, whether it be going deeper into ads, price increases, new functionality. We're for that always with respect to our partnerships with our DSPs.\nRich Greenfield: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Meghan Durkin with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nMeghan Durkin: Hi, good morning, guys. Steve, you talked a lot about different growth areas, whether emerging markets, new revenue streams, acquisitions and other. Of all these areas, can you maybe rank order those for the drivers of future growth for the company? And then maybe for Lou, I'm not sure if this is for Lou, but maybe discuss how you think about the return targets when you're allocating capital towards deals? Maybe that will help us to frame the impact from the acquisitions you've done recently. Thanks.\nSteve Cooper: Sure. Well, look we -- I don't know, if I would rate them, I think that all of our areas and investment priority have tremendous value and will provide us with tremendous returns at least for the foreseeable future, our core business will probably remain our largest business traditional streaming and we continue to support that by growing our A&R budgets through M&A and by increasing our geographic footprint. So, that will continue to support the core and when you think about revenue diversification, we take product from our core business and adapt that product to use cases with respect to revenue diversification. That continues as we invest in these new and emerging economic models. Instead, the core business, we see as -- I think we -- we've said repeatedly, we see a lot of runway in the traditional streaming world and we see tremendous opportunity in both the -- what are called mature markets. We think that runway is still quite long and in the emerging markets, where we think there will be a conversion over time from free, that's pretty well in many parts of the world, where they're really are no ad markets, we'll develop the ad markets and will convert to subscriptions, if, in fact, they choose to pay with currency as opposed to time. So our priorities in investment, our core diversification, innovation in technology and people and all of them are essential by way of investments to ensure that we thrive in the future.\nLou Dickler: And with regards to the IRR question -- your IRR question, we've talked quite a bit about being financial disciplined, which we are, that will continue. We'll continue to look for accretive investments. The IRR that we get on these deals is depending on the risk profile of that deal, so the higher risk deals have a higher return. So the blended rate is probably in -- somewhere in the mid-teens, but again, it depends on risk profile in an individual deal.\nMeghan Durkin: Okay. Thanks. Best wishes to Eric. I hope he's back with us soon.\nLou Dickler: Thank you.\nSteve Cooper: Thank you. We'll pass on your kind wishes.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Ivan Feinseth with Tigress Financial. Your line is open.\nIvan Feinseth: Thank you for taking my questions. Congratulations on another great year and please send my best wishes to Eric for a speedy recovery. Can you talk a little bit how Sodatone has helped you discover and find great artists and even in areas where you may have to increase the investment that you've gotten a better return? And since music is going to be a major part of the immersive experience on the metaverse, Steve, what -- when you start to hear people talking about this more, what areas of the metaverse excites you the most?\nSteve Cooper: Okay. So with respect to Sodatone, let's say, it's, for lack of a better term, a super advanced search engine, which we utilize to identify recording our songwriters and their music, as it is getting traction and emerging literally in every market around the world. It is used by way -- it is used by hundreds of our employees on a daily basis to evaluate virtually all the new music and the artists associated with that new music inside of their specific territories or regionals. And while I can't give specific numbers, I will tell you that in the last several years, the number of our artists that we've identified and sign through Sodatone has probably quintuple. It is a remarkable tool and our people -- I mean, they use it literally, Ivan, 24/7. So now the metaverse. What excites you? The -- if you look at the trends, you can see that more and more people -- and when I say more and more people I'm talking hundreds and millions not thousands or tens and millions, are spending more and more time in these interactive environments. So if you look at many of the ways in, which music is distributed it is not an interactive environment. It is literally a push-pull environment. In these metaverses, it is the combination of social, gaming, entertainment and probably more things that I'm just unaware of that I could add. And in these environments, it goes beyond push-pull. It is actually interconnectivity between content, between people, between people and content, between communities, interaction between adjacent communities. And it is bringing music and our artists to those environments to build and enhance not only the interconnectivity of music to people, but our artists to people, our artists to artists and it just -- it creates so many possibilities for the convergence of content artists, fandom and distribution that -- I think that it will take music and music's ability to really be the one true global language to an entirely different level, Ivan. It's super exciting. \nIvan Seth: Yes I agree. Thank you and wishing you, happy holidays and New Year\nSteve Cooper: Thank you. My pleasure.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Steve Cooper, for closing remarks. \nSteve Cooper: So again, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today. I hope everyone has a wonderful, safe holiday season and we will talk to you in the new calendar year. Stay safe everyone. Thank you. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Lou Dickler",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. 2021 was an incredibly challenging year to navigate and our results only continue to validate the strength and resilience of our business model. In Q4, total revenue was up approximately 21% on a constant currency basis, and up over 22% on an as-reported basis. These results are underpinned by growth across almost all of our revenue lines. For the full year, our total revenue increased by over 15% on a constant currency basis and almost 19% on an as-reported basis. Our strong operating performance was evidenced by the healthy growth in adjusted OIBDA, and adjusted EBITDA we saw in both the fourth quarter and the full year. In Q4 adjusted OIBDA increased by over 25% to $218 million, with margins improving from 15.5% to 15.8%. Adjusted EBITDA, which reflects the pro forma impact of future cost savings and transactions completed in the quarter increased by 34% to $237 million with margins improving from 15.7% to 17.2%. I want to note that, both metrics reflect adjustments for approximately $15 million of restructuring costs, primarily driven by severance costs associated with the leadership and related organizational changes that Steve referenced earlier. For the full year, adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EBITDA increased by approximately 29% and 30% respectively. You can find the calculations and reconciliations related to adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EBITDA in our press release. Recorded Music revenue increased by over 21% in the fourth quarter. Residual revenue increased by 17% driven by continued strength in streaming revenue which grew approximately 20% year-over-year. All components of streaming revenue experienced robust year-over-year growth. Recorded Music revenue from emerging streaming platforms remain at $235 million on an annualized basis, but pre-meaningfully year-over-year. As we have said previously, we expect the growth cadence from this revenue source to near the timing of significant new deals and renewals with scaled platforms. We also saw meaningful recovery in several of our revenue streams that were impacted by COVID. Artist services and expanded rights revenue which includes merchandising grew by 70%, reflecting an increase in merchandising and concert promotion revenue as touring has resumed. Physical revenue grew by 22%, primarily driven by the strong demand for vinyl across the globe. Licensing revenue declined 9%, mainly due to onetime licensing settlements in the prior year, partially offset by higher synchronization revenue as businesses continue to recover from COVID destruction. Adjusted OIBDA was $204 million, a 27% increase over the prior year quarter with margins improving to 17.4%. This growth was driven by higher overall revenue some of which came from recovering lower-margin areas like artist services, resulting in more muted margin. For the full year, Recorded Music revenue increased by 16% driven by growth across almost all revenue streams. Adjusted OIBDA increased by 29% with margin improving by 1.7 percentage points to 21.5%. Music Publishing revenue increased by over 19% in Q4 reflecting growth across all of its components. This performance was led by digital revenue growth of around 19% and driven by the continuing growth in streaming across traditional and emerging platforms. Digital revenue growth in the quarter was impacted by a favorable onetime settlement in the prior year quarter. There was also a shift in the collection of writer share of US digital performance income for certain digital service providers, which will affect the next couple of quarters. The impact of this change is a reduction in our revenue offset by a reduction in our writers' royalty expense resulting in a modest benefit to our margin. Sync revenue increased due to higher motion picture and commercial income and a onetime licensing settlement. Mechanical and Performance revenue increased as businesses continue to recover from COVID disruption with mechanical which only covers physical sales benefited from an increase in new sales. Music Publishing adjusted OIBDA increased 14% to $49 million, while margin decreased 1.5 percentage points to 23.9%. For the full year, Music Publishing revenue increased by 13% and adjusted OIBDA increased by 12% with margin declining from 24.4% to 23.5%. For both Q4 and the full year, the decline in adjusted OIBDA margin was attributable to revenue mix including the COVID impact to higher-margin performance revenue. Operating cash flow increased 30% to $228 million and 38% to $638 million for Q4 and the full year, respectively. We have revised our free cash flow definition to be more aligned with how we evaluate the operating performance of the business and to better reflect cash flow available for acquisitions, investments and return to shareholders. Going forward references to free cash flow will be calculated as operating cash flow minus CapEx. On this basis our free cash flow grew 39% to $192 million in Q4 and 44% to $545 million for the full year. This translates to an impressive free cash flow conversion rate defined as the ratio of adjusted OIBDA to free cash flow of 89% and 54% for Q4 and the full year, respectively. These metrics underscore the strong operating performance within our business as well as our financially disciplined ROI-focused investment strategy. CapEx in Q4 was $35 million compared to $37 million in the prior year quarter and $93 million for the full year compared to $85 million in the prior year. The increase was related to our previously announced transformation initiatives. Looking ahead to 2022, we expect to see elevated CapEx in the range of $130 million to $135 million for the full year. This increase is due to the continued investment in our IT and finance infrastructure as well as the expansion of EMP's facilities to address the strong demand in our e-commerce business. Our financial transformation program remains on track and is expected to deliver annualized run rate savings of about $35 million to $40 million once fully implemented in 2023. As of September 30, we had a cash balance of $499 million total debt of $3.3 billion and net debt of $2.8 billion. Since our IPO, we have actively managed our capital structure reducing our weighted average cost of debt from 4% to 3.2% and extending maturities with our nearest maturity date now in 2028. As we look ahead to the rest of the year, our expectations for total revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth rates remain largely in line with our internal expectations at the time of the IPO. While there will be some variability in revenue mix driven in part by recovery in certain COVID impacted revenue streams, we continue to be very optimistic about our long-term growth and have a high degree of confidence in our margin targets. We are truly excited about the steady flow of great music we have in store and look forward to an amazing rest of the year. Thank you for joining our call today and we will now open the call for questions. With regard to the ESP question, Michael. And as we mentioned, the revenue for this streaming is recognized on a step basis not linear and that's due to the timing of the deal renegotiations. The deals are often structured as buyout versus consumption and as a result, you see that revenue impact. We do believe that as the services scale and new services come online in this space that the economic's looking to improve and we're seeing revenue growth. Yeah. So as Steve mentioned, there is not a difference between our margin and UMG's margin on an apples-to-apples basis. They're nearly identical. Under IFRS Universal was able to classify certain rent and lease costs as depreciation which is excluded from EBITDA. If you net out the impact of that rent expense differential, as we noted our margins are nearly identical and Steve pointed out, slightly increased in greater sale. Yeah, Ben, it's not material. It's 1% or 2%. Yes. So, on the margin differential between physical and digital, the difference is roughly 15% better margin on the streaming side. And then what was the second question is with regard to ad revenue? Yes. So, ad revenue continues to grow nicely. Obviously, COVID did have an impact on digital advertising revenue that seems recovered. Then that's business for us if you look at DSP, UPROXX, Songkick, IMGN as social publishers combined revenues for that about $100 million in the quarter relative size. And with regards to the IRR question -- your IRR question, we've talked quite a bit about being financial disciplined, which we are, that will continue. We'll continue to look for accretive investments. The IRR that we get on these deals is depending on the risk profile of that deal, so the higher risk deals have a higher return. So the blended rate is probably in -- somewhere in the mid-teens, but again, it depends on risk profile in an individual deal. Thank you."

            "name": "Steve Cooper",
            "content": "Thanks Kareem. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As we all know, the world has been through a very dark time over the last 18 months. We've all been challenged both personally and professionally in ways we could not have imagined. But with vaccination rates continuing to rise and many territories beginning to return to some kind of normality, it feels like there is light at the end of the proverbial tunnel. If there's anything that our company has learned during this pandemic, it's that for billions of people across the globe music is essential to our well-being. It permeates our lives and gives us inspiration and hope. It gives voice to our anxiety, our sadness and our joy. In short, music touches our hearts like no art form. When concerts and live appearances were nearly impossible to stage, our ability to super serve our artists and songwriters during this extraordinary time was made crystal clear. Our global resources, creative expertise and commercial reach make us an absolutely indispensable component that is critical to the entire music value chain. Six years ago, Warner doubled down onstream. We became the first music major to make it our largest revenue source. Today our business is no longer driven by linear format shifts, it's multifaceted and expanding in all directions, from social media to gaming and home fitness to VR, we're at the heart of virtually every consumer experience. The increasing complexity of our industry goes hand-in-hand with the ever-growing potential of our company. We're not merely embracing our future, we're creating it. With that let's get to an overview of our fourth quarter results. Total revenue increased by 22% on an as reported basis and 21% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA was up by 34% with margin improvement driven by strong revenue growth. In Recorded Music, revenue increased by more than 21%, digital grew 17% and streaming grew 20%. Meanwhile, revenue sources that were severely impacted by COVID, most notably artist services and physical recovered nicely growing 70% and 22%, respectively. In Publishing, we delivered revenue growth of over 19%. Digital, mechanical and sync, all had double-digit growth. It was also very good news that performance revenue appears to have bottomed out and has returned to modest growth as consumer venues across the board continue to recover. As new capital force into our sector, we're even more confident in our position. We have the expertise and capabilities to increase market share, not merely the financial resources to buy it. We're highly selective and only pursue deals that through our active management of assets will be accretive to shareholder value. Our track record of making financially disciplined investments is evidenced by the rate at which we convert adjusted OIBDA to free cash flow. Now let me drill down into the key tenets of our business with a few examples of the progress we're making. While taste trends and tech will change, artists and songwriters will always be our driving force. We pride ourselves on our ability to work with talent at all stages of their careers and across a wide diversity of genres generations and geographies. We're developing and nurturing the next generation of recording artists such as the UK's Tim Ambrose and Joel Chords, Argentina's Lit Killah and the US is Don Toliver, whose album debuted, number one on the top album sales chart at Billboard. We're also trusted by iconic recording artists to manage their life's work. In just the last several months, we struck careers expanding deals with Coldplay Madonna David Guetta and the estate of David Bowie. On the publishing side, big signings include German Rapper RIN, R&B Star Jhene Aiko, Rock Legend William Patrick Corgan and Grammy Award winner Daniel Caesar. We also welcome pop icon Sam Smith for a joint publishing agreement with Tim & Danny Music. Many artists also see the value in having Warner as their home for both recorded music and publishing. Led Zeppelin, Bruno Mars, Madonna, Saweetie, Tones and I Cardi, B and Lizzo, to name just a few. While our artists and songwriters are at the center of all that we do, genius really does need come. More than ever, talent needs help to cut through the noise. Our mission is to elevate great artists, amplify their music and help their voices move the world. Music is the only true global language and I'm a big believer in the principle that success can come from anywhere and translate everywhere. Simultaneously, music is becoming hyper-localized in Japan, Germany and France, the three biggest non-Anglo markets, domestic repertoires on average over 65% of the business. We're now operating in over 70 countries and expanding our resources and reach, in a number of key growth markets. In the past year alone, we've made a number of strategic moves to strengthen our A&R presence across the globe. We've launched Atlantic Records in both Russia and Benelux. And ADA, our Indie Label Services Group expanded into Russia and as well as Italy. We continued our expansion into Africa by acquiring leading independent label Coleske. We further expanded our Asian and Chinese footprint with our hip-hop labels Asiatic and JUUICE and our dance label Whet. And we forged an important new alliance with Rotana music, the Arab world's leading independent label. We also established through local Warner companies and ADA important distribution partnerships with KRU in Malaysia, Sky Digital in India and Orfeo\u0301n Videovox and world wide records in Mexico, Baramey in Cambodia, Yin Yang Media in Vietnam and Same Sane Records in Australia. Here's a great example of our strategy and action. We signed Nigerian artist CKay to Warner Music South Africa. After he was discovered through our partnership with Chocolate City, in an unprecedented achievement, CKay history by scoring the most watched music video in the world on YouTube with his song, Love Nwantiti. The biggest song to ever come out of Africa, this is also one of the most popular tracks on Instagram and TikTok and also on Spotify where it now has over 180 million streams. Bloomberg recently took note of this calling it a watership moment for African pop. Let's now turn to our progress with innovation and revenue diversification. Not so long ago people questioned the outlook for streaming growth. Today it's clear from our results that subscription streaming still has tremendous runway ahead of it, bolstered by price increases in developed markets and increasing penetration in emerging markets. That growth is being supplemented by emerging platforms that are incorporating music as a critical feature of their user experiences. To that end, we're positioning ourselves at the intersection of social, gaming, fitness VR and music. We continue to lead this sector by being the first major to partner with disruptive players in these dynamic and rapidly growing spaces. In another pioneering move, we are to date the only music major to port a partnership with Twitch, paving the way for even greater collaboration in the future. We've also continued to grow our own unique network of consumer media brands including; IMGN, UPROXX, Songkick and HipHopDX. We've expanded our reach through the development of outlets such as the Pit and Indie mix tape and we continue to manage nearly 5000 unique artist, YouTube channels. As a result, our ad base revenue grew significantly in Q4 with sustained gains across these owned and operated properties. Our network of consumer media brands is a strategic focus for us and has significant growth potential. Beyond the lookout for an exciting announcement later this week which will tell you how we intend to further turbocharge this area. None of this however is possible without great people in place to make it all happen. We continue to strengthen our executive branch promoting from within as well as hiring great talent from the outside. Over the past year we've installed our next-generation of digital savvy leadership in many key territories. These include Canada, China, Germany, France, Latin America, South Africa, Poland, the Philippines, Taiwan and Indonesia. We also have a new leader of ADA Worldwide along with separate US and international ADA heads making us even more capable of serving indie artist and labels everywhere. Without a doubt, we have the best team in the business one that positions us exceptionally well for this new golden age in music. With our new Head of ESG in place since August, we plan to issue our first annual report in early 2022. It will provide a detailed update on our progress in sustainability and DEI among other topics. This past June, we published our first impact report from the Warner Music Group, Blavatnik Family Foundation Social Justice Fund. Established last year the fund has focused its grant making on three key pillars: education, criminal justice reform and arts and culture. It's already committed funds and resources to a number of amazing organizations with many more brands on the way. Fiscal year '22 is already off to a strong start. Coldplay's new album was their ninth number 1 in the UK, while Ed Sheeran has the fastest selling album in 2021 so far. Silk Sonic with Bruno Mars and Anderson, Paak duo dropped their new album an evening with Silk Sonic, Last Friday. We also have an amazing slate of holiday releases from Kelly Clarkson, Michael Buble\u0301, Sia, Rob Thomas, Brett Eldredge and others. In today's detention economy, our business not only demands an ever-increasing flow of great music, but also ever-growing levels of service to great artists and songwriters. Warner achieved staff mix better than any other company in the world, and we look forward to raising the bar even further in the coming year and beyond. Before I turn it over to Lou, there is one final matter I'd like to mention. While major music companies such as Warner Chappell negotiated direct licenses with streaming services in the United States, there is a portion of the revenue from traditional audio streaming services, specifically mechanical revenue, which is subject to a compulsory license at rates set by the Copyright Royalty Board. You may have read about Formal Records IV, which is the name of the ongoing US digital Mechanical Royalty Rate proceeding Web IV, the CRB. It will determine what music publishers and songwriters will be paid by these traditional services between 2023 and 2027. There's been a lot of controversy in the music press on this topic, but there should be nothing controversial about music publishers and songwriters getting paid, the fair market rates to which they're entitled. We fight hard for the rights of our songwriters. Songs and songwriters are at the very beginning of the fast value chain and there would be no music business without them. We fully support the NMPA's advocacy efforts in the current rate proceeding and we look forward to a positive outcome from Warner Chappell Music and its songwriters. And with that, I'll turn it over to Lou. Great. So Michael, on the first one, A&R trends, I think it's important to remember that we manage a portfolio and as artists move from the initial stages of their career to really an established artists to either regional or global superstars, the cost does increase. That cost is generally however offset by reduced marketing and promotional expense as artists become better and better known. I think that given the financial resources that are flowing into both the Recorded Music and the music publishing markets, that the goal for Warner is to not get wrapped up in the exuberance in the market for lack of a better term and maintain our financial discipline that has been in place since the acquisition of Warner by Access. We are very thoughtful about how we allocate capital and what we put into any deal. Whether it be an artist or M&A, we are very thoughtful about not buying market share loss and we are very thoughtful about structuring deals to ensure that we get what we believe to be appropriate returns on our investments. You'll also see that our A&R budgets, marketing and promotional budgets have remained in relatively sticky, the same relationship with revenue over the last four, five, six years and we expect that to continue. That is a stable relationship but may in our marketing and promotion to revenue for the foreseeable future Michael. So, I'll take the first part of that then Lou will take the second part. I think that Universal's IPO was good news not only for the broad music sector but content specifically, because to your point it has with content in a brighter spotlight and it's made the investor community more aware of the opportunities by way of investing on the content side of the music sector. We've competed with them, successfully for decades. And we wish them all success possible with respect to this launch. Lou will talk about some of the differences, when you look at margins. But what I will point out is -- and Lou will explain it to you our margins are essentially identical and we do that with essentially half the operating leverage. Okay. Well, what we see Andrew, are really new models emerging every day. And I don't see any reason, why each new models, whether it be in social, gaming, fitness, other areas aren't going to continue to emerge. Almost all of them utilize music is one of the critical elements of building out their models and frankly underlying their success. I personally, couldn't imagine a time without music or a hip-hop without music. So when we looked at these new emerging opportunities which are showing up all around the world, they present tremendous possibilities for Warner. They're very exciting. These start-ups, we love to invest in them. We love to work with them to build these businesses to scale. And I think our drive and our ability to just diversify revenue will just continue. With respect to where do I think things are really going to get more interesting and more special. Most of the models we currently see are the traditional push-pull, where we push to the models, the models pushed to consumers, and consumers pull through the music that we help differentiate from much of the white noise that's uploaded these days into the services. I think with the -- within these large-scale metaverses Fortnite, Roblox and others that we will begin to see an opportunity where providing content and distribution convergence Andrew. And when you begin to look at the global reach the number of people that spend meaningful amounts of time in these new worlds I think it provides a universe of opportunity for Warner. Right. So, what I've actually said about market share Ben is we won't acquire it at a loss. The way we will continue to maintain and grow our market share is through our investment strategies which really we invest broadly speaking in the four buckets and then I'll swing back to those that all four of them actually influence market share. First, we invest in our core business and we do that both through an expansion of our A&R budget in line with the growth of our revenue and through M&A and in the publishing sites primarily through the acquisition of catalogs. We are and have been making a concerted effort to invest in diversification of revenue which is bucket number two. Bucket number three is innovation and technology and bucket four is in our people. So, all of those over time impact our ability to build and gain market share, specifically with money flowing into the sector -- lots of money flowing into this sector we are -- because of the fact that we live in this sector oftentimes have more insight and a better view of what assets can and as importantly what they can't do by way of being turbocharged. Our organization are experts that I think the best in the world at turbocharging these sort of assets. So, when we look at them we look at them to see how we can create that turbocharging what headroom do we believe we have and how through financial discipline we are prepared to either price and/or restructure companies to achieve those ROI goals. We are very selective. We are certainly not going to be one of the lemons going over a cliff by spending unwisely and thinking that without the organization and the expertise these assets are going to grow through sub mystical or magical formulation. So, that's on the first piece. On the second piece, we've been very clear about what we do with our free cash flow. Our first priority is to invest in the business again with rigorous discipline to get the ROIs that we believe our shareholders deserve. The second is when we can't find those opportunities is to return capital to our shareholders. The third is to pay down debt. With respect to the third we haven't gotten to that intersection yet then and I don't see us getting there for the foreseeable future. Okay. First of all, on the UK study, we believe what it's going to show is that on the content side and we should keep in mind that that study is going to look at the music section, not only content providers, but DSPs. But on the content side, we have a fiercely, fiercely competitive industry, where artists and songwriters have historically have today and will tomorrow have the benefit of fierce competition between the labels to land both recording artists and songwriters and I think that the fact that we have such a competitive environment, it will show that songwriters and recording artists are the primary beneficiaries of that composition. And their compositions are the benefits of that competition. So I'm confident that that will be a finding. I think that the -- I think that the review or the investigation will also show that our artists in our roaster and the way we select those artists and songwriters to join us and then what we do by way of marketing and promotion will show that streaming has been in general very good to them. I think it will also show that the availability of tools for DIY artists today by way of being able to professionally sound mix and distribute their music has never been greater. So I'm confident that when somebody looks at the music ecosphere from a purely factual objective point of view that people will finally realize and people will come to the conclusion that the labels are actually the good guys not the bad guys. On guidance, as you noted, we don't give guidance. That being said, our music in the market at the moment, the music that's coming some of our biggest artists are dropping music as we speak, I'm confident that the momentum we generated over the last three, six, nine, 12 months will continue. Sure. Okay. So let me just quickly talk about the renaissance of physical and then I'll turn it over to Lou on both the comparisons of margins and the outlook for growth of ad base revenue. There is a segment of people around the world that love vinyl. It is the recordings in and of themselves are an art form. The album art, the notes, the lyrics, the way it's put together represents a work of art and a work of art from these incredible musical geniuses. So this segment of the music loving population loves vinyl, loves to collect it and we think it is that we'll continue to grow. The constraint being the ability to actually produce vinyl given the limited amount of capacity around the globe. Incidentally, vinyl just per se collecting it is for many people something that's really cool, and for what it's worth, I think, they're right and Lou will now walk you through the numbers. How we see ad revenue? Did that answer your question? Yes. Well, first of all, we've always been of the view that people can pay for music either with their time or with currency. I guess, in an ad-supported business their time is the currency; and on the subscription side, money is the currency. So we've always been supportive of both. We in our discussions with DSPs always encourage them to look at revenue generating possibilities to strengthen both their businesses and our business. I think that, when you look at the way digital ad revenue has bounced back, the way it grew during the pandemic, we see others jumping into it, Rich. But we like all forms of revenue that support the music sector and ultimately flow to our artists into us. So, whether it be going deeper into ads, price increases, new functionality. We're for that always with respect to our partnerships with our DSPs. Sure. Well, look we -- I don't know, if I would rate them, I think that all of our areas and investment priority have tremendous value and will provide us with tremendous returns at least for the foreseeable future, our core business will probably remain our largest business traditional streaming and we continue to support that by growing our A&R budgets through M&A and by increasing our geographic footprint. So, that will continue to support the core and when you think about revenue diversification, we take product from our core business and adapt that product to use cases with respect to revenue diversification. That continues as we invest in these new and emerging economic models. Instead, the core business, we see as -- I think we -- we've said repeatedly, we see a lot of runway in the traditional streaming world and we see tremendous opportunity in both the -- what are called mature markets. We think that runway is still quite long and in the emerging markets, where we think there will be a conversion over time from free, that's pretty well in many parts of the world, where they're really are no ad markets, we'll develop the ad markets and will convert to subscriptions, if, in fact, they choose to pay with currency as opposed to time. So our priorities in investment, our core diversification, innovation in technology and people and all of them are essential by way of investments to ensure that we thrive in the future. Thank you. We'll pass on your kind wishes. Okay. So with respect to Sodatone, let's say, it's, for lack of a better term, a super advanced search engine, which we utilize to identify recording our songwriters and their music, as it is getting traction and emerging literally in every market around the world. It is used by way -- it is used by hundreds of our employees on a daily basis to evaluate virtually all the new music and the artists associated with that new music inside of their specific territories or regionals. And while I can't give specific numbers, I will tell you that in the last several years, the number of our artists that we've identified and sign through Sodatone has probably quintuple. It is a remarkable tool and our people -- I mean, they use it literally, Ivan, 24/7. So now the metaverse. What excites you? The -- if you look at the trends, you can see that more and more people -- and when I say more and more people I'm talking hundreds and millions not thousands or tens and millions, are spending more and more time in these interactive environments. So if you look at many of the ways in, which music is distributed it is not an interactive environment. It is literally a push-pull environment. In these metaverses, it is the combination of social, gaming, entertainment and probably more things that I'm just unaware of that I could add. And in these environments, it goes beyond push-pull. It is actually interconnectivity between content, between people, between people and content, between communities, interaction between adjacent communities. And it is bringing music and our artists to those environments to build and enhance not only the interconnectivity of music to people, but our artists to people, our artists to artists and it just -- it creates so many possibilities for the convergence of content artists, fandom and distribution that -- I think that it will take music and music's ability to really be the one true global language to an entirely different level, Ivan. It's super exciting. Thank you. My pleasure. So again, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today. I hope everyone has a wonderful, safe holiday season and we will talk to you in the new calendar year. Stay safe everyone. Thank you."

At the request of Warner Music Group today's call is being recorded for replay purposes; and if you object, you may disconnect at any time. Now, I would like to turn today's call over to your host, Mr. Kareem Chin, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nKareem Chin: Good morning, everyone.

And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve.\nSteve Cooper: Thanks, Kareem. Good morning, everyone and thanks so much for joining us. Just over a year ago, we took our company public. We were confident that our business would remain resilient during the pandemic. Thankfully our confidence was well founded. Today, we're really fortunate that in looking back over our third quarter, we can celebrate the extraordinary achievements of our global team, our artists, our songwriters and our partners during this really crazy time. Entertainment consumption habits have been changing swiftly during COVID and the growth in new business models have been accelerating. We continued to keep pace through our constant evolution, and as a result, we've grown stronger than ever. After we review our quarterly results, I'll focus some additional remarks on three areas, first, how we're driving our core business by investing in new and established artists and songwriters; second, how we continue to innovate to deliver long-term growth; and lastly, how we're playing the game differently through our unique portfolio of media brands. Our continued momentum led to impressive results this last quarter. Total company revenue growth was 27%. While some of the year-over-year comparisons are distorted by COVID, these results reflect the strength of our release schedule and the recovery in certain of our COVID affected revenues. Digital revenue grew 23% and now represents roughly 70% of total revenue. Adjusted EBITDA grew by approximately 49%, while our margin improved to over 21%. Recorded music delivered revenue growth of approximately 28% marked by growth across digital, physical, licensing and artist services. Streaming revenue within recorded music grew 27%. This increase was driven by successful new releases and strong carryover performances, a rebound in ad supported revenue and the continued strong growth in revenue from emerging platforms. Physical revenue also saw a major resurgence, growing 136%. This reflects the increasing popularity of vinyl across the globe. Licensing revenue showed a significant rebound returning to growth of approximately 28%. Artist services was up slightly as double-digit growth at our e-tailing company, EMP was mostly offset by the continued disruption in live concerts and tour related march [ph]. As always, the central story is the fantastic new music we've been releasing. Here are some highlights. We're happy to have new music from global superstars like Ed Sheeran and Coldplay. Ed debuted his new single Bad Habits on TikTok shattering the platforms record for a live music performance with over 5.5 million unique views. Meanwhile, Coldplay debuted their new single Higher Power with a special broadcast from outer space, thanks to the cooperation of the International Space Station. Dance music icon, David Guetta continued an incredible year scoring multiple top 10 hits around the world. In June, we announced the signing of a new career-spanning partnership with David, that includes both his legendary recorded music catalog and future releases. Performers at his level can choose any route to release their music, and our new partnership is a great endorsement of the value we offer to creative community at all stages of their careers. Warner Record signed Bella Poarch, one of TikTok's global stars. The video from her first single, Build a Bitch had the biggest debut ever on YouTube for a new artist, with over 200 million views and counting. Other highlights included Nashville's Gabby Barrett becoming the first female solo artist in five years to go number one on Billboard's country charts with her first two singles. Russ Millions and Atlantic Records Tion Wayne taking over the world with their single body soaring to number one in multiple countries and the rolling out of major international hits from JJ Lin, Aya Nakamura and Master KG. And there is more fantastic music to come this year from Ed, David, Lizzo, Coldplay, Silk Sonic and Justin Quiles to name a few. In publishing, we delivered revenue growth of 21%. This impressive showing was due to 20% and 55% increases in digital and sync respectively. We're seeing a return for normal sync with TV and film production recovering nicely. However, performance revenue remain nearly flat year-over-year due to the ongoing restrictions for bars, restaurants, clubs and concerts. In Q3, Warner Chappell had a share in 37 number one songs across the US Billboard streaming and radio charts, that's up from 23 last quarter. And according to Billboard's Publisher's Quarterly, we increased our share in both US radio airplay and hot 100 songs. Notable songwriters signings included four-time Grammy winner, Anderson.Paak, multi-platinum record producer, Vinylz, R&B hit maker Sean Garrett and legendary Mexican star, Marco Antonio Solis. In April, Warner Chappell's creative and commercial momentum was recognized with the prestigious ASCAP Pop Publisher of the Year Award. We're achieving all of this success by making smart investments in our artists and songwriters. One of our primary goals is to grow our core business through a constant flow of amazing new music, driven by financially disciplined A&R and M&A strategies. We continue to have size, agility and focus working for us. Our agreement to purchase 12Tone Music announced in July is just the latest example, of an immediately accretive investment. 12Tone's roster includes recordings by Anderson.Paak, Christian music superstar Rauw Alejandro, breakthrough electronic artist ILLENIUM, music legend, Dolly Parton and hit Asian collective 88rising. Turning now to innovation. We're continuously transforming to become a tech enabled digital first company in order to deliver long-term growth. As I've said many times before, the music ecosphere is so much more than albums, singles and videos. We want to be everywhere the fans are. So we're focusing on quickly adapting to new trends and staying ahead of the change cure. While subscription streaming has a long runway ahead of it, we're also positioning ourselves at the center of the converging world of social gaming, digital fitness and music. We continue to build our portfolios relationships with best-in-class partners like Roblox, Wave and Dapper Labs. Recently, we deepened our engagement in the gaming space with Bella Poarch becoming the first Filipino artists to be featured in the Fortnite dance emote and Bebe Rexha returning to The Sims for an in-game music festival. As part of our ongoing efforts to expand our presence in China, we launched dance label Whet Records. Last month, Whet signed six artists, one of whom was Ha Jiang, a virtual idol, who exists only online. These digital stars are phenomenon in countries such as China and Japan with huge social media followings. With Ha Jiang, Warner is leading the virtual idol crossover into the music business. As a result of our digital first strategy, our revenue from emerging platforms, such as Facebook, TikTok and Peloton is now running at roughly $235 million on an annualized basis and that's just from recorded Music. Look for more announcements to come in the near future about new investments, partnerships and collaborations. We've also spoken in the past about differentiating ourselves in the market by building an influential network of consumer destinations. Each brand has music in its DNA and command its own independent audience of loyal fans. Our strategy to turbocharge growth included bringing together our owned media channels under a newly formed digital advertising and creative content unit. These coordinated channels, which include UPROXX, Songkick, IMGN, HipHopDX, and Cover Nation have all seen accelerated growth over the past year. It's a powerful thing for us to control our own network of media brands. This is something unique to the Warner Music Group. These assets manually drive digital ad revenue, they give us a real edge in terms of understanding fan behavior, quickly catching new trends and identifying cultural shifts. Last month, we were pleased to welcome Nancy Dubuc, the CEO of VICE Media Group to our Board of Directors. Nancy was also named Chairperson of the Audit Committee and a member of the Executive Committee. A dynamic leader, she has wide-ranging experience in visual programming and digital entertainment and is already proving to be an excellent addition. At the same time, Thomas H. Lee announced that he was stepping down from the company's board of directors after more than 17 years. In light of his many contributions, Thomas has been given the title of Director Emeritus. On behalf of everyone at WMG, I'd like to thank Tom and say how grateful we are that we will continue to benefit from his expertise. Last month, we also issued the first Annual Report for the Warner Music Group/Blavatnik Family Foundation Social Justice Fund. So far the fund has chosen nine amazing organizations to support including the black cultural archives, Howard University and Meek Mill's REFORM Alliance. It's important to note that this fund is just one aspect of our long-term dedication to improving diversity, equity and inclusion within our company, our industry and our society. Although, we are making progress, we also understand this is an effort that requires sustained commitment. As part of this, we recently hired Samantha Sims, our first VP of ESG. Sam joins us from PVH, the parent company of Calvin Klein. She will work closely with our global management team, including key leaders, such as our global heads of people and DEI to help build program that will drive meaningful and sustainable change. We look forward to updating you on our progress. Let me wrap up by saying that our first year as a public -- publicly traded company, despite home confinement has been one of the most satisfying in my career. Our amazingly creative artists and songwriters backed by our outstanding team have accomplished so much during a very trying time. Above all, I'm really excited by what's to come. There is so much great music innovation and growth on the horizon, and all of this has been supported by our shareholders for which we are all deeply appreciative. So stay tuned, as we continue to lead the way into the music future. And with that, I'll turn it over to Eric.\nEric Levin: Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. We are extremely proud of our third quarter results, which were marked by strong growth across all components of streaming, recovery in several areas that had been negatively impacted by COVID and adjusted EBITDA growth that meaningfully outpaced our revenue growth, highlighting the strong operating leverage in our business. While some of the companies or some of the comparisons to the prior year quarter are distorted given the impact that COVID had on certain areas of our business, I will do my best to contextualize them. Our total revenue was up approximately 27% on a constant currency basis, and up almost 33% on an as reported basis compared to prior year quarter. These results are underpinned by growth across all of our revenue lines, with the exception of performance in music publishing. Adjusted OIBDA increased by over 58% to $263 million with margin improving from 16.4% to 19.6%. This improvement was driven by revenue mix and strong operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA increased almost 50% to $282 million, with margin improving from 18.7% to 21%. This increase was largely due to the same factors that drove adjusted OIBDA performance pushing our adjusted EBITDA to over $1 billion on an LTM basis. Please refer to our press release for calculations and reconciliations related to adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EBITDA. In recorded music, revenue increased approximately 28% over the prior year quarter. Digital revenue grew by almost 24%, driven by a 27% growth in streaming revenue. Our streaming revenue was propelled by growth from traditional platforms, as well as emerging platforms, resulting in robust growth across all of its components. Subscription streaming, which is by far the largest contributor showed accelerated growth this quarter. Ad supported streaming, which was impacted by COVID in the prior year quarter continued its strong recovery with growth more than doubling that of subscription streaming. And our revenue from emerging streaming platforms continues to grow at an extraordinary pace and is now running at approximately $235 million on an annualized basis and that's for recorded music alone. Physical had an impressive recovery with revenue growth of over 136%. This was driven by a resurgence in global demand for vinyl and increasing retail sales, as businesses reopen, as well as comparisons against the prior year quarter that was severely impacted by COVID. While the increased demand for vinyl has been welcomed, we continue to believe that physical will be in secular decline on a normalized basis. Licensing revenue returned to growth of almost 28% due to higher synchronization revenue broadcast fees, as businesses began to recover from COVID. Artist services revenue was slightly up, as double digit growth at EMP was partially offset by lower revenue associated with concert promotion and tour related merchandising. Recorded music adjusted OIBDA grew by more than 52% over the prior year quarter to $254 million driven by revenue mix, strong operating performance and the impact from recent acquisitions. Adjusted OIBDA margin increased 2.6 percentage points to 22%. Music Publishing revenue increased by over 21%, driven by growth in digital, sync and mechanical revenue. Digital revenue increased by over 20%, reflecting the continuing shift to streaming and timing of new digital deals with digital service providers. Synchronization revenue increased by almost 55%, due to growth in motion picture and commercial income. Mechanical revenue increased 30%, as businesses began to recover from COVID related disruption, while performance revenue was down 4%, due to the ongoing effects of the restrictions for bars, restaurants, concerts and live events. Music Publishing adjusted OIBDA grew by over 29% from $34 million to $44 million, with margin improving from 22.8% to 23.3%; this was due to revenue mix and restructuring in the prior year quarter. Operating cash flow decreased from $123 million in the prior year quarter to $91 million. The decline was driven by strong operating performance more than offset by continued investment in A&R and timing of working capital. On a year-to-date basis, operating cash flow was up 43% from $287 million to $410 million. Free cash flow decreased to negative $71 million from $87 million in the prior year quarter, largely due to an increase in investment activity, as well as lower operating cash flow. CapEx of $20 million was flat compared to the prior year quarter and includes costs associated with our financial transformation program. The total investment associated with our financial transformation program is expected to be about $20 million in fiscal '21 with annualized run rate savings of approximately $35 million to $40 million once fully implemented in 2023. For fiscal '21, we continue to expect total CapEx to be in the range of $90 million to $100 million. Cash taxes were $37 million in the quarter. And as of June 30, we had a cash balance of $442 million and net debt of around $2.9 billion. Over the last year, we have actively managed our capital structure, reducing our weighted average cost of debt from 4% to 3.4% and extending maturities, with our nearest maturity date now in 2026. In July, we received the credit rating upgrade from S&P to BB plus in recognition of the continued health and stability in our business. We are incredibly proud of our third quarter results, and all of our progress and growth during our first year, as a publicly traded company. We look forward to bringing you some new amazing music in the coming months. And thank you for joining the call today, and we will open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matthew Thornton with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nMatthew Thornton: Hey, good morning, Steve, good morning, Eric. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two quick ones, if I could, I guess. First, I guess around some of the recent price increases at Spotify, obviously it's still early. I think they are really the only DSPs that -- that's taken that initiative. I'm curious kind of what your sensing out there in terms of feedback either from -- from other DSP receptivity, from consumer receptivity and whether this can kind of continue looking forward. I guess, that's the first question. And then, just the second question, again the DSP, they're starting to talk a little more about the opportunity to really accelerate live both virtual and in-person as well as merchandising just by driving better awareness, conversion and consumption of these revenue buckets. And I'm curious, if you're looking at that, if you're embracing that, if you think again, there is the opportunity here by partnering with DSP to really drive an inflection and growth in some of those revenue streams. Any thoughts there? Thanks, guys.\nEric Levin: So I'll respond to -- I can respond to most of that, Matthew. So Spotify has increased rates, and I think they've said that their rates are -- rate increases are performing well with consumers, and they kind of met their expectations for the quarter. We have no reason to believe that to be anything, but completely true. ARPUs will continue overall to decline, as the mix of emerge -- as roll out of subscribers in emerging markets, which are lower rates, will decrease the overall pool. Within developed markets, the ability to start to see rates increase, we think is a meaningful opportunity. So we are really pleased that Spotify is taking the initiative and starting to take really positive steps there. Regarding other DSPs, what we can say is that we've been vocal over the years that there is real price upside opportunity, and we think the steps that Spotify is taking is very indicative of that. And we would be highly supportive of other DSPs, evaluating their subscriber base and looking at taking similar steps that are appropriate for their platform. So we think there are opportunities there, but we don't speak for other DSPs, and I wouldn't want to speak for them in that area. With regard to live and merch, the first thing, I would say is that one of the kind of consumer platforms that we have acquired and been running successfully for several years is what [ph] called Songkick. Songkick provides listings of where artists are performing live, and in the COVID affected world, where they are performing live online. They are a significant input provider and data provider for that -- for Spotify, as well as other services. And so we really believe in live and live online. We've also recently announced the partnership with Wave, which is a leader in that space, and we have been doing a series of online concerts part of our relationship with Roblox's been a series of concerts, whether it's Royal Blood performed at the Bloxy Awards or Why Don't We or Ava Max performing on there [ph] and we've done, that's just the start. We've done a whole series of events. We've also talked about the Ed Sheeran launch event on TikTok, which was a live streamed event. So we think there's a lot of opportunity there, certainly to reach audience and build awareness and promote artists and music. The monetization of those platforms is very, very early, and there will be a lot of experimentation, but we are an active player in that equation, and see there is real [ph] opportunity that we're really leaning into, and we'll see how it develops both from a monetization and commercial standpoint. But we do see it as an active meaningful part of the future for music going forward.\nMatthew Thornton: Very helpful. Thanks, Eric.\nEric Levin: Thanks, Matthew so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Morris with Guggenheim. Your line is open.\nMichael Morris: Thank you. Good morning. I have two topics, one on the subscription streaming revenue strengthened, one on artists relationships. First, I'm hoping maybe you could unpack the strength in the subscription streaming side a bit more between what was maybe share gains, given the strength of your portfolio and what was just health of that business overall. And if you think about what's driving strength in -- in the business overall, I'd love to hear, if you have any insights on particular platforms, particular geographies anything that -- that stands out to you there. And on the artists relationship side, Steve, you referenced this partnership with David Guetta, as very long-term partnership. And my question, yes, I really love to just hear some more detail, and the context is, I think there is concern in the marketplace that eventually technology disintermediates the label value and we've talked about that a lot, you guys have addressed that. But having an established artists strike a long-term partnership with you clearly show some two way commitment. And so, I'd love to just hear what's in it for each of you, as you -- you establish something long term like that? Thanks guys.\nEric Levin: Sure.\nSteve Cooper: So I can start.\nEric Levin: No, go ahead Steve. I can tackle the first\u2026\nSteve Cooper: No, no, why don't you do subscription strength first, then, I'll deal with artists relations.\nEric Levin: Super. So thanks for the question, Michael. So first, I would say that the subscription revenue growth or I would say the streaming revenue growth is really multilayered. It is driven by subscription growth both in developed and emerging market, supplemented by the price increases that have started to roll through. We've actually seen a modest acceleration in the subscription growth side. Ad supported revenue has -- grew, as we said twice at the rate of subscription streaming indicating that ad supported, which was affected in the early days of COVID has really fully rebounded. And the emerging forms of streaming continued their solid growth, as new deals are signed and the existing platforms continue to grow. Now, talking about share gain versus market growth, what I would say is a lot of this is driven first and foremost, we have said from the beginning of the year that our release schedule was back half loaded. Steve indicated in his comments, some of those artist, whether it's Ed Sheeran, Silk Sonic, the Bruno Mars, Anderson.Paak partnership, Cardi B, Coldplay, but also artists all over the world, whether it's Aya Nakamura in France or Capo Plaza in Italy, it's not just the superstars, it is the global superstars, but it's also stars from all over the world, as well as breaking artists like Tion Wayne and others. So it's a broad reach that is really helping drive our business forward. The market is recovering from COVID in areas that have been affected and the areas that were unaffected like subscription streaming continue their strong momentum. So it's really Michael, kind of a broad reach of release schedule having an impact, but also the market overall performing well. And you put the two together, it creates a nice environment for growth. Steve, I'll hand it to you.\nSteve Cooper: Great. Thanks, Eric. So Michael, on the -- on the artists relation side, the benefit that artists see by way of continuing to partner with -- with a record label is that despite the tools that are available in the digital world, the ability to effectively utilize those tools and amplify an artists career, their music, their social presence through an organization that has a global and local footprint literally around the globe can't be underestimated. There are tens of thousands of tracks that are uploaded every day to streaming services around the world, literally tens of thousands of tracks. And the number probably now is somewhere between half a million to three quarters of the million tracks a week that are being upload. The value a label brings to an artist is the ability to help them cut through the noise of a 0.5 million or three quarters of the million tracks and separate their music and their career from literally all of this noise. And when you look out really, really well established tremendous global superstars, all of whom have had the opportunity to pivot away from labels, utilize the digital tools available and go solo so to speak by way of moving their career long. Virtually none of them -- none of them have taken that decision to pivot away from the labels because at the end of the day it is -- it is not that easy to separate the really great music and the great artists without an organization, such as ours behind that. It is really, really hard work. And so when enter into these partnerships or we have these long-term arrangements with our artists, they are arrangements that are mutually beneficial, where -- where the artist sees the value that we bring, and we see a genius and greatness in these artists, so that it allows with an enormous amount of enthusiasm and our own creativity to get behind these artists and they see the value that we bring to them in their careers. So it's a mutually symbiotic relationship, Michael.\nMichael Morris: Great. Thank you, both. Appreciate it.\nEric Levin: Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Meghan with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nMeghan Durkin: Hi, good morning, guys. I wanted to talk about the emerging platform revenue line. You've given us the number for Recorded Music, how much would including Music Publishing increase this run rate. And then, Facebook, I think announced that they're going to be spending $1 billion on creators. I wanted to know what you think music is going to be as a percentage of that spend? Thanks.\nEric Levin: Okay. Well, I'll take the first one, Meghan. Well, nice speaking, Meghan. So obviously we don't release the publishing number. I think you can look at relative proportions Recorded Music and publishing digital revenue and get a general feel. So it -- Recorded Music is call a five-ish times what the size of revenue of digital revenue than publishing plus or minus ballpark that are logically return to what the emerging streaming platforms be in publishing. What I would say is, we -- on publishing, we don't release the number, but we are just as active in developing relationships with these platforms and helping support their growth, but also being a partner and helping lead the way in helping innovative platforms get launched, find traction and hopefully generate long-term sustainable business models and -- and licenses with both recorded music and publishing. Steve, do you want to discuss the Facebook side.\nSteve Cooper: Sure. Hi, Meghan. So you're right, Facebook -- Facebook has announced that they are going to be focusing our investments in creators. This is a response to what they see other platforms, YouTube and TikTok doing. While I won't venture a guess at any specific number, what I would point out is, when you look at the platforms that Facebook wants to compete against. When you look at other changes that they have initiated recently by way of example, Instagram Reels, what they're doing is responding to different use cases for short form video, most of which, not all, but most of which include the utilization of music. And what we would expect to see is that whatever the specifics are, by way of how they channel that billion dollars to creators, those creators in the main -- will utilize in some way shape or form music, and they will continue to amplify the use cases, and the growth of the new music ecosphere [ph]. So -- so I would expect that we along with the creators, songwriters, music publishers and other labels will be in -- in many ways beneficiaries of that additional spend maybe.\nMeghan Durkin: Okay. And congrats guys on Megan Thee Stallion, the other Megan getting the Sports Illustrated cover that was critical.\nSteve Cooper: Thank you, Meghan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nBen Swinburne: Thanks. Good morning. Eric if I look at the first nine months of the year, at least on an OIBDA basis, margins are up, I think a couple of hundred basis points year-on-year, you guys are tracking into this -- nicely to this 20% plus number. Could you [ph] just talk about your confidence in margin expansion looking out over the next several years, you guys see anything that -- that the rails, at least the -- the trend line. And -- and if you want to -- if you want to talk numbers, feel free, but I think you probably won't? And then Steve, just on the M&A front. You guys continue to sort of acquire not just labels, but also technology assets and other thing. Could you remind us of sort of how you're thinking about deploying cash flow, as we move into '22 and '23 because your leverage is coming down, and I don't think the company is looking to delever. So just sort of remind us where your -- what your M&A strategy and what your focus is [ph]? Thank you.\nEric Levin: Sure. I'll take the first one first, so on margins and good to hear from you, Ben. So yes, look, when we went public, which is just 13 months ago, we said, three years, four years out kind of 2023, 2024, 2025 timeframe, we expect a low to mid -- it's really, we said low 20s. As we are now a year out, we're already low 20s margin and there are couple of factors. One is executing on the plans that we had laid out, continuing to work on cost containment, whether it's through our technology innovation and automation and efficiency programs. We also have our financial transformation, which will be going live in the next year with the bulk of the savings commencing in fiscal '23, continuing to gain leverage on scale, as we continue to grow our revenue and gross margin faster than we're growing our underlying cost base. Overtime, we would say the shift from physical to streaming, although, this quarter the physical result was obviously up substantially. So for this quarter that doesn't quite hold. So we continue to believe that on a long-term basis, continuing to improve our margins above where they are now into the mid 20s is reasonable and where we're heading. However, we will say in the short term, as we recover from COVID and specifically when concert touring and comes back, our concert promotion businesses and our tour merch businesses, which are the two businesses that haven't recovered yet are some of our lower margin businesses. So as those recover, we could expect to see some moderation in the growth in margins in the short-term, but long-term, all the fundamentals are in place for continued growth of margin from here forward. And we continue to focus on that as a key business driver both in terms of efficiency in our business and scale. Thanks, Ben. Steve, I hand it to you on the M&A question.\nSteve Cooper: Thanks, Eric. So Ben, first of all on our M&A strategy and our pre-cash flow deployment. First of all, as a broad envelope, we are very, very disciplined with respect to our investment strategy, which includes M&A, you know, but -- whenever we do, I need to [ph]. When we look at A&R, when we do M&A, our financial discipline and thoughtful financial metrics always guide our decisions, and you can see this frankly materialize, when you look at our -- our conversion from OIBDA, EBITDA to cash flow. It becomes evident that we remain very disciplined. Relative to our specific strategies, we plan on continuing to invest both organically and through M&A in our core business and expanding our global footprint. We continue to invest in both our own technological capabilities, as well as into third party technological capabilities. And -- and in those third party investments, we not only through commercial relationships brought [ph] these investments, work with them to define, how we -- how we move our music maybe to broadly diversified revenue streams and that will continue to also be a priority for us. So core music business, diversified revenue streams and future proofing us by both internally and externally, investments in new technology. When it comes to our free cash flow, you're right, we have no intention at the moment to pay down debt. With the full support of our Board, we look first at reinvesting in our business both with respect to organic, as well as M&A opportunities. Secondly, to repatriate to our shareholders excess cash through dividends and presumably over time through modest dividend growth. And if and when we run out of opportunities to invest or to repatriate to shareholders, we will then look to debt -- debt reduction but I don't see that in the near future.\nBen Swinburne: Thank you, both.\nEric Levin: Thanks, Ben.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tim Nollen with Macquarie. Your line is open.\nTim Nollen: Oh, thanks very much. I'd like to pick up on this discussion about the new technologies and opportunities. Last earnings call, we spoke for the first time about Wave and about Genies and about Dapper Labs and now you're introducing this concept of this virtual idol. And I'm just curious, no pun intended, but how real is that. How much of a Chinese specific opportunity is it? How well positioned are you to benefit from any growth there? And could that be something that -- that takes hold outside of -- outside of China or Asia? Thanks.\nSteve Cooper: Well, Tim, I think that -- that it's already taken hold or -- or it is certainly -- it's certainly approaching taken a hold, not only in China, Japan, other Asian countries, but globally. When -- when you look at -- when you look at social gaming and these metaverses, we are already talking about dealing in the virtual world, where people have their own avatars, they -- they have their own communities in these virtual worlds, and -- and these virtual worlds reflect, who people believe [ph] they are or they want to be between the real world. Creating virtual only beings is not an illogical next step. And while this has been predominantly the domain of certain Asian countries, the -- the wonderful thing about it is, you can create these characters, and you can create a tremendous fan base relative to these characters. I'll give you something that's a bit analogous, even though it's not quite all in the digital format. When you watch a Marvel movie, you're talking about characters that don't exist in real life, and you're talking about computer generated imaging that doesn't exist in real life. But yet when you look at the success of these -- of these characters, you look at the success of Marvel, you look at the success of many of the sound tracks, which in many cases we provide, and you look at the fan base for these characters being able to do this in a virtual world is really not a massive step, Tim, and it's a step, where we're determined to lead the crossovers of these virtual beings into the world of music. So, I don't think it's a flash in the pan. I think it's here to stay. And not only do I think it's here to stay, I think it's here to grow. Hopefully, that answers your questions.\nTim Nollen: That's great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Your line is open.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Thank you. I apologize, if this has been asked already. I joined a little bit late. But on the M&A side, I guess, a slightly different aspect of what's going on in the industry is just the catalog acquisitions and Spotify seems to be a function of where rates are [ph]. But is there an opportunity for you guys to potentially look at monetizing that could drive a higher multiple because today you don't seem to get the credit for that side of the business compared to what some of these transactions are doing in the marketplace. So, is there an opportunity for you guys to think about that business slightly differently? Thanks.\nSteve Cooper: So Eric, let me take the first part, then, you can take the second part, I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name.\nKannan Venkateshwar: This is Kannan from Barclays.\nSteve Cooper: Okay. I'm on a cellphone. So it's still difficult anyway. So -- so let me give you kind of a top view, and then, Eric will give you a -- from the financial perspective. From kind of an overview, when you -- when you look at some of these multiples to us, it looks like a movement in capital from fixed income to what people believe there is a sexier [ph] form of fixed income. And many of these financial players are buying assets with no organization or no capability to activate those assets. We also agree with your observation, it may be a function of rate. But what we don't see is us turning into asset managers and moving away from being a proactive music entertainment company, and we're looking to the long-term, and our long-term growth. And while, it's always possible, you know, if our shareholders and Board desired to pack in certain assets and continue to manage them. But frankly, we do that already. And you're right, while we don't trade at a 30 or 35 time multiple. When you think about buying assets at that multiple and not having an organization to not only activate, but turbocharge the cash flow attributable to those assets from our perspective, that just seems not like a business that we're inclined to be in at the moment. Eric, do you want to add to that?\nEric Levin: Yes. I would just supplement that with a few quick thing. One is, we have been active this year in acquiring music rights both in the recorded and the publishing side. We announced earlier this year that we acquired for $338 million [ph] assets, with a run rate or OIBDA of $37 million. And we've done other deals throughout the year as well. But we are always financially disciplined. We are not looking to compete at the highest price for the sake of competing. We look at assets that are accretive to our business. And as Steve said, we are always looking for assets, where we can drive incremental value, whether the opportunities are in reenergizing and re-releasing masters catalog, looking to improve sync opportunities. So when we put all together, we think we've found an effective array of assets to acquire this year that we've been able to put to work, as Steve said and generate even higher revenue and returns. And we'll continue to look for opportunities in the market that meet our criteria. But we'll always apply our same financial discipline to it, Kannan.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Thank you, both.\nEric Levin: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And this concludes the question-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Steve Cooper for closing remarks.\nSteve Cooper: Again, I want to thank everybody for taking the time to join us today. And please look for our future announcements, as -- as I mentioned during the during the -- during the presentation part of the call. And please everyone continue to enjoy the summer, but stay safe because it really remains a crazy, crazy world. So thanks, again, speak to you soon. Bye-bye.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Eric Levin",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. We are extremely proud of our third quarter results, which were marked by strong growth across all components of streaming, recovery in several areas that had been negatively impacted by COVID and adjusted EBITDA growth that meaningfully outpaced our revenue growth, highlighting the strong operating leverage in our business. While some of the companies or some of the comparisons to the prior year quarter are distorted given the impact that COVID had on certain areas of our business, I will do my best to contextualize them. Our total revenue was up approximately 27% on a constant currency basis, and up almost 33% on an as reported basis compared to prior year quarter. These results are underpinned by growth across all of our revenue lines, with the exception of performance in music publishing. Adjusted OIBDA increased by over 58% to $263 million with margin improving from 16.4% to 19.6%. This improvement was driven by revenue mix and strong operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA increased almost 50% to $282 million, with margin improving from 18.7% to 21%. This increase was largely due to the same factors that drove adjusted OIBDA performance pushing our adjusted EBITDA to over $1 billion on an LTM basis. Please refer to our press release for calculations and reconciliations related to adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EBITDA. In recorded music, revenue increased approximately 28% over the prior year quarter. Digital revenue grew by almost 24%, driven by a 27% growth in streaming revenue. Our streaming revenue was propelled by growth from traditional platforms, as well as emerging platforms, resulting in robust growth across all of its components. Subscription streaming, which is by far the largest contributor showed accelerated growth this quarter. Ad supported streaming, which was impacted by COVID in the prior year quarter continued its strong recovery with growth more than doubling that of subscription streaming. And our revenue from emerging streaming platforms continues to grow at an extraordinary pace and is now running at approximately $235 million on an annualized basis and that's for recorded music alone. Physical had an impressive recovery with revenue growth of over 136%. This was driven by a resurgence in global demand for vinyl and increasing retail sales, as businesses reopen, as well as comparisons against the prior year quarter that was severely impacted by COVID. While the increased demand for vinyl has been welcomed, we continue to believe that physical will be in secular decline on a normalized basis. Licensing revenue returned to growth of almost 28% due to higher synchronization revenue broadcast fees, as businesses began to recover from COVID. Artist services revenue was slightly up, as double digit growth at EMP was partially offset by lower revenue associated with concert promotion and tour related merchandising. Recorded music adjusted OIBDA grew by more than 52% over the prior year quarter to $254 million driven by revenue mix, strong operating performance and the impact from recent acquisitions. Adjusted OIBDA margin increased 2.6 percentage points to 22%. Music Publishing revenue increased by over 21%, driven by growth in digital, sync and mechanical revenue. Digital revenue increased by over 20%, reflecting the continuing shift to streaming and timing of new digital deals with digital service providers. Synchronization revenue increased by almost 55%, due to growth in motion picture and commercial income. Mechanical revenue increased 30%, as businesses began to recover from COVID related disruption, while performance revenue was down 4%, due to the ongoing effects of the restrictions for bars, restaurants, concerts and live events. Music Publishing adjusted OIBDA grew by over 29% from $34 million to $44 million, with margin improving from 22.8% to 23.3%; this was due to revenue mix and restructuring in the prior year quarter. Operating cash flow decreased from $123 million in the prior year quarter to $91 million. The decline was driven by strong operating performance more than offset by continued investment in A&R and timing of working capital. On a year-to-date basis, operating cash flow was up 43% from $287 million to $410 million. Free cash flow decreased to negative $71 million from $87 million in the prior year quarter, largely due to an increase in investment activity, as well as lower operating cash flow. CapEx of $20 million was flat compared to the prior year quarter and includes costs associated with our financial transformation program. The total investment associated with our financial transformation program is expected to be about $20 million in fiscal '21 with annualized run rate savings of approximately $35 million to $40 million once fully implemented in 2023. For fiscal '21, we continue to expect total CapEx to be in the range of $90 million to $100 million. Cash taxes were $37 million in the quarter. And as of June 30, we had a cash balance of $442 million and net debt of around $2.9 billion. Over the last year, we have actively managed our capital structure, reducing our weighted average cost of debt from 4% to 3.4% and extending maturities, with our nearest maturity date now in 2026. In July, we received the credit rating upgrade from S&P to BB plus in recognition of the continued health and stability in our business. We are incredibly proud of our third quarter results, and all of our progress and growth during our first year, as a publicly traded company. We look forward to bringing you some new amazing music in the coming months. And thank you for joining the call today, and we will open the call for questions. So I'll respond to -- I can respond to most of that, Matthew. So Spotify has increased rates, and I think they've said that their rates are -- rate increases are performing well with consumers, and they kind of met their expectations for the quarter. We have no reason to believe that to be anything, but completely true. ARPUs will continue overall to decline, as the mix of emerge -- as roll out of subscribers in emerging markets, which are lower rates, will decrease the overall pool. Within developed markets, the ability to start to see rates increase, we think is a meaningful opportunity. So we are really pleased that Spotify is taking the initiative and starting to take really positive steps there. Regarding other DSPs, what we can say is that we've been vocal over the years that there is real price upside opportunity, and we think the steps that Spotify is taking is very indicative of that. And we would be highly supportive of other DSPs, evaluating their subscriber base and looking at taking similar steps that are appropriate for their platform. So we think there are opportunities there, but we don't speak for other DSPs, and I wouldn't want to speak for them in that area. With regard to live and merch, the first thing, I would say is that one of the kind of consumer platforms that we have acquired and been running successfully for several years is what [ph] called Songkick. Songkick provides listings of where artists are performing live, and in the COVID affected world, where they are performing live online. They are a significant input provider and data provider for that -- for Spotify, as well as other services. And so we really believe in live and live online. We've also recently announced the partnership with Wave, which is a leader in that space, and we have been doing a series of online concerts part of our relationship with Roblox's been a series of concerts, whether it's Royal Blood performed at the Bloxy Awards or Why Don't We or Ava Max performing on there [ph] and we've done, that's just the start. We've done a whole series of events. We've also talked about the Ed Sheeran launch event on TikTok, which was a live streamed event. So we think there's a lot of opportunity there, certainly to reach audience and build awareness and promote artists and music. The monetization of those platforms is very, very early, and there will be a lot of experimentation, but we are an active player in that equation, and see there is real [ph] opportunity that we're really leaning into, and we'll see how it develops both from a monetization and commercial standpoint. But we do see it as an active meaningful part of the future for music going forward. Thanks, Matthew so much. Sure. No, go ahead Steve. I can tackle the first... Super. So thanks for the question, Michael. So first, I would say that the subscription revenue growth or I would say the streaming revenue growth is really multilayered. It is driven by subscription growth both in developed and emerging market, supplemented by the price increases that have started to roll through. We've actually seen a modest acceleration in the subscription growth side. Ad supported revenue has -- grew, as we said twice at the rate of subscription streaming indicating that ad supported, which was affected in the early days of COVID has really fully rebounded.

So it's a broad reach that is really helping drive our business forward. The market is recovering from COVID in areas that have been affected and the areas that were unaffected like subscription streaming continue their strong momentum. So it's really Michael, kind of a broad reach of release schedule having an impact, but also the market overall performing well. And you put the two together, it creates a nice environment for growth. Steve, I'll hand it to you. Thanks, Michael. Okay. Well, I'll take the first one, Meghan. Well, nice speaking, Meghan. So obviously we don't release the publishing number. I think you can look at relative proportions Recorded Music and publishing digital revenue and get a general feel. So it -- Recorded Music is call a five-ish times what the size of revenue of digital revenue than publishing plus or minus ballpark that are logically return to what the emerging streaming platforms be in publishing. What I would say is, we -- on publishing, we don't release the number, but we are just as active in developing relationships with these platforms and helping support their growth, but also being a partner and helping lead the way in helping innovative platforms get launched, find traction and hopefully generate long-term sustainable business models and -- and licenses with both recorded music and publishing. Steve, do you want to discuss the Facebook side. Sure. I'll take the first one first, so on margins and good to hear from you, Ben. So yes, look, when we went public, which is just 13 months ago, we said, three years, four years out kind of 2023, 2024, 2025 timeframe, we expect a low to mid -- it's really, we said low 20s.

And we continue to focus on that as a key business driver both in terms of efficiency in our business and scale. Thanks, Ben. Steve, I hand it to you on the M&A question. Thanks, Ben. Yes. I would just supplement that with a few quick thing. One is, we have been active this year in acquiring music rights both in the recorded and the publishing side. We announced earlier this year that we acquired for $338 million [ph] assets, with a run rate or OIBDA of $37 million. And we've done other deals throughout the year as well. But we are always financially disciplined. We are not looking to compete at the highest price for the sake of competing. We look at assets that are accretive to our business. And as Steve said, we are always looking for assets, where we can drive incremental value, whether the opportunities are in reenergizing and re-releasing masters catalog, looking to improve sync opportunities. So when we put all together, we think we've found an effective array of assets to acquire this year that we've been able to put to work, as Steve said and generate even higher revenue and returns. And we'll continue to look for opportunities in the market that meet our criteria. But we'll always apply our same financial discipline to it, Kannan. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks, Kareem. Good morning, everyone and thanks so much for joining us. Just over a year ago, we took our company public. We were confident that our business would remain resilient during the pandemic. Thankfully our confidence was well founded. Today, we're really fortunate that in looking back over our third quarter, we can celebrate the extraordinary achievements of our global team, our artists, our songwriters and our partners during this really crazy time. Entertainment consumption habits have been changing swiftly during COVID and the growth in new business models have been accelerating. We continued to keep pace through our constant evolution, and as a result, we've grown stronger than ever. After we review our quarterly results, I'll focus some additional remarks on three areas, first, how we're driving our core business by investing in new and established artists and songwriters; second, how we continue to innovate to deliver long-term growth; and lastly, how we're playing the game differently through our unique portfolio of media brands. Our continued momentum led to impressive results this last quarter. Total company revenue growth was 27%. While some of the year-over-year comparisons are distorted by COVID, these results reflect the strength of our release schedule and the recovery in certain of our COVID affected revenues. Digital revenue grew 23% and now represents roughly 70% of total revenue. Adjusted EBITDA grew by approximately 49%, while our margin improved to over 21%. Recorded music delivered revenue growth of approximately 28% marked by growth across digital, physical, licensing and artist services. Streaming revenue within recorded music grew 27%. This increase was driven by successful new releases and strong carryover performances, a rebound in ad supported revenue and the continued strong growth in revenue from emerging platforms. Physical revenue also saw a major resurgence, growing 136%. This reflects the increasing popularity of vinyl across the globe. Licensing revenue showed a significant rebound returning to growth of approximately 28%. Artist services was up slightly as double-digit growth at our e-tailing company, EMP was mostly offset by the continued disruption in live concerts and tour related march [ph]. As always, the central story is the fantastic new music we've been releasing. Here are some highlights. We're happy to have new music from global superstars like Ed Sheeran and Coldplay. Ed debuted his new single Bad Habits on TikTok shattering the platforms record for a live music performance with over 5.5 million unique views. Meanwhile, Coldplay debuted their new single Higher Power with a special broadcast from outer space, thanks to the cooperation of the International Space Station. Dance music icon, David Guetta continued an incredible year scoring multiple top 10 hits around the world. In June, we announced the signing of a new career-spanning partnership with David, that includes both his legendary recorded music catalog and future releases. Performers at his level can choose any route to release their music, and our new partnership is a great endorsement of the value we offer to creative community at all stages of their careers. Warner Record signed Bella Poarch, one of TikTok's global stars. The video from her first single, Build a Bitch had the biggest debut ever on YouTube for a new artist, with over 200 million views and counting. Other highlights included Nashville's Gabby Barrett becoming the first female solo artist in five years to go number one on Billboard's country charts with her first two singles. Russ Millions and Atlantic Records Tion Wayne taking over the world with their single body soaring to number one in multiple countries and the rolling out of major international hits from JJ Lin, Aya Nakamura and Master KG. And there is more fantastic music to come this year from Ed, David, Lizzo, Coldplay, Silk Sonic and Justin Quiles to name a few. In publishing, we delivered revenue growth of 21%. This impressive showing was due to 20% and 55% increases in digital and sync respectively. We're seeing a return for normal sync with TV and film production recovering nicely. However, performance revenue remain nearly flat year-over-year due to the ongoing restrictions for bars, restaurants, clubs and concerts. In Q3, Warner Chappell had a share in 37 number one songs across the US Billboard streaming and radio charts, that's up from 23 last quarter. And according to Billboard's Publisher's Quarterly, we increased our share in both US radio airplay and hot 100 songs. Notable songwriters signings included four-time Grammy winner, Anderson.Paak, multi-platinum record producer, Vinylz, R&B hit maker Sean Garrett and legendary Mexican star, Marco Antonio Solis. In April, Warner Chappell's creative and commercial momentum was recognized with the prestigious ASCAP Pop Publisher of the Year Award. We're achieving all of this success by making smart investments in our artists and songwriters. One of our primary goals is to grow our core business through a constant flow of amazing new music, driven by financially disciplined A&R and M&A strategies. We continue to have size, agility and focus working for us. Our agreement to purchase 12Tone Music announced in July is just the latest example, of an immediately accretive investment. 12Tone's roster includes recordings by Anderson.Paak, Christian music superstar Rauw Alejandro, breakthrough electronic artist ILLENIUM, music legend, Dolly Parton and hit Asian collective 88rising. Turning now to innovation. We're continuously transforming to become a tech enabled digital first company in order to deliver long-term growth. As I've said many times before, the music ecosphere is so much more than albums, singles and videos. We want to be everywhere the fans are. So we're focusing on quickly adapting to new trends and staying ahead of the change cure. While subscription streaming has a long runway ahead of it, we're also positioning ourselves at the center of the converging world of social gaming, digital fitness and music. We continue to build our portfolios relationships with best-in-class partners like Roblox, Wave and Dapper Labs. Recently, we deepened our engagement in the gaming space with Bella Poarch becoming the first Filipino artists to be featured in the Fortnite dance emote and Bebe Rexha returning to The Sims for an in-game music festival. As part of our ongoing efforts to expand our presence in China, we launched dance label Whet Records. Last month, Whet signed six artists, one of whom was Ha Jiang, a virtual idol, who exists only online. These digital stars are phenomenon in countries such as China and Japan with huge social media followings. With Ha Jiang, Warner is leading the virtual idol crossover into the music business. As a result of our digital first strategy, our revenue from emerging platforms, such as Facebook, TikTok and Peloton is now running at roughly $235 million on an annualized basis and that's just from recorded Music. Look for more announcements to come in the near future about new investments, partnerships and collaborations. We've also spoken in the past about differentiating ourselves in the market by building an influential network of consumer destinations. Each brand has music in its DNA and command its own independent audience of loyal fans. Our strategy to turbocharge growth included bringing together our owned media channels under a newly formed digital advertising and creative content unit. These coordinated channels, which include UPROXX, Songkick, IMGN, HipHopDX, and Cover Nation have all seen accelerated growth over the past year. It's a powerful thing for us to control our own network of media brands. This is something unique to the Warner Music Group. These assets manually drive digital ad revenue, they give us a real edge in terms of understanding fan behavior, quickly catching new trends and identifying cultural shifts. Last month, we were pleased to welcome Nancy Dubuc, the CEO of VICE Media Group to our Board of Directors. Nancy was also named Chairperson of the Audit Committee and a member of the Executive Committee. A dynamic leader, she has wide-ranging experience in visual programming and digital entertainment and is already proving to be an excellent addition. At the same time, Thomas H. Lee announced that he was stepping down from the company's board of directors after more than 17 years. In light of his many contributions, Thomas has been given the title of Director Emeritus. On behalf of everyone at WMG, I'd like to thank Tom and say how grateful we are that we will continue to benefit from his expertise. Last month, we also issued the first Annual Report for the Warner Music Group/Blavatnik Family Foundation Social Justice Fund. So far the fund has chosen nine amazing organizations to support including the black cultural archives, Howard University and Meek Mill's REFORM Alliance. It's important to note that this fund is just one aspect of our long-term dedication to improving diversity, equity and inclusion within our company, our industry and our society. Although, we are making progress, we also understand this is an effort that requires sustained commitment. As part of this, we recently hired Samantha Sims, our first VP of ESG. Sam joins us from PVH, the parent company of Calvin Klein. She will work closely with our global management team, including key leaders, such as our global heads of people and DEI to help build program that will drive meaningful and sustainable change. We look forward to updating you on our progress. Let me wrap up by saying that our first year as a public -- publicly traded company, despite home confinement has been one of the most satisfying in my career. Our amazingly creative artists and songwriters backed by our outstanding team have accomplished so much during a very trying time. Above all, I'm really excited by what's to come. There is so much great music innovation and growth on the horizon, and all of this has been supported by our shareholders for which we are all deeply appreciative. So stay tuned, as we continue to lead the way into the music future. And with that, I'll turn it over to Eric. So I can start. No, no, why don't you do subscription strength first, then, I'll deal with artists relations. Great. Thanks, Eric. So Michael, on the -- on the artists relation side, the benefit that artists see by way of continuing to partner with -- with a record label is that despite the tools that are available in the digital world, the ability to effectively utilize those tools and amplify an artists career, their music, their social presence through an organization that has a global and local footprint literally around the globe can't be underestimated. There are tens of thousands of tracks that are uploaded every day to streaming services around the world, literally tens of thousands of tracks. And the number probably now is somewhere between half a million to three quarters of the million tracks a week that are being upload. The value a label brings to an artist is the ability to help them cut through the noise of a 0.5 million or three quarters of the million tracks and separate their music and their career from literally all of this noise. And when you look out really, really well established tremendous global superstars, all of whom have had the opportunity to pivot away from labels, utilize the digital tools available and go solo so to speak by way of moving their career long. Virtually none of them -- none of them have taken that decision to pivot away from the labels because at the end of the day it is -- it is not that easy to separate the really great music and the great artists without an organization, such as ours behind that. It is really, really hard work. And so when enter into these partnerships or we have these long-term arrangements with our artists, they are arrangements that are mutually beneficial, where -- where the artist sees the value that we bring, and we see a genius and greatness in these artists, so that it allows with an enormous amount of enthusiasm and our own creativity to get behind these artists and they see the value that we bring to them in their careers. So it's a mutually symbiotic relationship, Michael. Sure. Hi, Meghan. So you're right, Facebook -- Facebook has announced that they are going to be focusing our investments in creators. This is a response to what they see other platforms, YouTube and TikTok doing. While I won't venture a guess at any specific number, what I would point out is, when you look at the platforms that Facebook wants to compete against. When you look at other changes that they have initiated recently by way of example, Instagram Reels, what they're doing is responding to different use cases for short form video, most of which, not all, but most of which include the utilization of music. And what we would expect to see is that whatever the specifics are, by way of how they channel that billion dollars to creators, those creators in the main -- will utilize in some way shape or form music, and they will continue to amplify the use cases, and the growth of the new music ecosphere [ph]. So -- so I would expect that we along with the creators, songwriters, music publishers and other labels will be in -- in many ways beneficiaries of that additional spend maybe. Thank you, Meghan. Thanks, Eric. So Ben, first of all on our M&A strategy and our pre-cash flow deployment. First of all, as a broad envelope, we are very, very disciplined with respect to our investment strategy, which includes M&A, you know, but -- whenever we do, I need to [ph]. When we look at A&R, when we do M&A, our financial discipline and thoughtful financial metrics always guide our decisions, and you can see this frankly materialize, when you look at our -- our conversion from OIBDA, EBITDA to cash flow. It becomes evident that we remain very disciplined. Relative to our specific strategies, we plan on continuing to invest both organically and through M&A in our core business and expanding our global footprint. We continue to invest in both our own technological capabilities, as well as into third party technological capabilities. And -- and in those third party investments, we not only through commercial relationships brought [ph] these investments, work with them to define, how we -- how we move our music maybe to broadly diversified revenue streams and that will continue to also be a priority for us. So core music business, diversified revenue streams and future proofing us by both internally and externally, investments in new technology. When it comes to our free cash flow, you're right, we have no intention at the moment to pay down debt. With the full support of our Board, we look first at reinvesting in our business both with respect to organic, as well as M&A opportunities. Secondly, to repatriate to our shareholders excess cash through dividends and presumably over time through modest dividend growth. And if and when we run out of opportunities to invest or to repatriate to shareholders, we will then look to debt -- debt reduction but I don't see that in the near future. Well, Tim, I think that -- that it's already taken hold or -- or it is certainly -- it's certainly approaching taken a hold, not only in China, Japan, other Asian countries, but globally. When -- when you look at -- when you look at social gaming and these metaverses, we are already talking about dealing in the virtual world, where people have their own avatars, they -- they have their own communities in these virtual worlds, and -- and these virtual worlds reflect, who people believe [ph] they are or they want to be between the real world. Creating virtual only beings is not an illogical next step. And while this has been predominantly the domain of certain Asian countries, the -- the wonderful thing about it is, you can create these characters, and you can create a tremendous fan base relative to these characters. I'll give you something that's a bit analogous, even though it's not quite all in the digital format. When you watch a Marvel movie, you're talking about characters that don't exist in real life, and you're talking about computer generated imaging that doesn't exist in real life. But yet when you look at the success of these -- of these characters, you look at the success of Marvel, you look at the success of many of the sound tracks, which in many cases we provide, and you look at the fan base for these characters being able to do this in a virtual world is really not a massive step, Tim, and it's a step, where we're determined to lead the crossovers of these virtual beings into the world of music. So, I don't think it's a flash in the pan. I think it's here to stay. And not only do I think it's here to stay, I think it's here to grow. Hopefully, that answers your questions. So Eric, let me take the first part, then, you can take the second part, I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name. Okay. I'm on a cellphone. So it's still difficult anyway. So -- so let me give you kind of a top view, and then, Eric will give you a -- from the financial perspective. From kind of an overview, when you -- when you look at some of these multiples to us, it looks like a movement in capital from fixed income to what people believe there is a sexier [ph] form of fixed income. And many of these financial players are buying assets with no organization or no capability to activate those assets. We also agree with your observation, it may be a function of rate. But what we don't see is us turning into asset managers and moving away from being a proactive music entertainment company, and we're looking to the long-term, and our long-term growth. And while, it's always possible, you know, if our shareholders and Board desired to pack in certain assets and continue to manage them. But frankly, we do that already. And you're right, while we don't trade at a 30 or 35 time multiple. When you think about buying assets at that multiple and not having an organization to not only activate, but turbocharge the cash flow attributable to those assets from our perspective, that just seems not like a business that we're inclined to be in at the moment. Eric, do you want to add to that? Again, I want to thank everybody for taking the time to join us today. And please look for our future announcements, as -- as I mentioned during the during the -- during the presentation part of the call. And please everyone continue to enjoy the summer, but stay safe because it really remains a crazy, crazy world. So thanks, again, speak to you soon. Bye-bye."

At the request of Warner Music Group, today's call is being recorded for replay purposes, and if you object, you may disconnect at any time. Now I would like to turn today's call over to your host, Mr. Kareem Chin, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nKareem Chin: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Warner Music Group's Fiscal Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Please note that our earnings press release, earnings snapshot and the Form 10-Q we filed this morning will be available on our website. On today's call, we have our CEO, Steve Cooper; and our CFO, Eric Levin, who will take you through our results, and then we'll take your questions.

Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in our earnings press release, our Form 10-Qs, Form 10-K and other SEC filings. And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve.\nSteve Cooper: Thanks, Kareem. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As you know, we posted excellent results in our first quarter, and I'm very happy to say that trend continues to build momentum. When you consider that only the last 2 weeks of the prior year's quarter were affected by COVID, our results are even more impressive. At a time when our business is stronger than ever, we're lengthening our stride with chart-topping releases from many of our biggest artists and songwriters. Today, I'd like to cover 3 key topics: first, our quarterly results and all the great new music that's driving them; second, our expansion into new markets around the world; and finally, our use of new technologies and emerging streaming platforms to further accelerate our growth. Despite the ongoing pandemic, second quarter total revenue grew 13% year-over-year, underpinned by double-digit revenue growth in both Recorded Music and Music Publishing. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 25%. Margin improved to over 21%. Recorded Music delivered revenue growth of 13%, marked by double-digit growth in both digital and physical revenue. This growth more than offset the continued dislocation in artist services and licensing revenue. Recorded Music streaming revenue grew 20%, driven by successful new releases and strong carryover performances. Ad-supported streaming has now fully recovered and grew at a higher rate than it did pre-COVID. Revenue from emerging streaming platforms, such as Facebook, TikTok and Peloton, is now running at $200 million on an annualized basis. Physical revenue also saw a major resurgence, growing 19% year-over-year, primarily due to an uptick in vinyl demand. Our success in the quarter spanned label groups, genres and geographies. This growth underscored our global strength as well as the diversity of our artists and repertoire. Here are just a few high points. Atlantic scored a massive #1 single on a Billboard Hot 100 with Leave the Door Open, the first release from Silk Sonic, the new Bruno Mars and Anderson Paak collaboration. Cardi B also widened her lead for the most #1 songs among female rappers with the mega-hit Up. At Warner Records, breakout star, CJ, topped Billboard's Emerging Artist Chart with his single Whoopty. Meanwhile, Saweetie teamed up with Doja Cat on Best Friend, hitting the top 10 on Billboard's Hot R&B and hip-hop songs chart. Elektra's Masked Wolf scored an international smash with Astronaut in the Ocean, generating well over 400 million streams to date and climbing to #1 in 8 countries. At Warner Music Nashville, Gabby Barrett released the hit single, The Good Ones, the follow up to her 5x platinum debut single, I Hope. Three-peat Grammy winning duo, Dan + Shay, unleashed their new smash, Glad You Exist, and are currently tallying 40 million global streams per week. In Europe, The Snuts and Capo Plaza, both had #1 albums. Amazingly, 7 tracks from Capo's album landed in Italy's top 10. As we look to the rest of the year, our hot streak should continue with forthcoming albums from both emerging and established stars like Myke Towers, Quando Rondo, Coldplay, Silk Sonic and Cardi B. More releases from our roster of global superstars will be dropping later this year. In Music Publishing, we delivered strong revenue growth of 12%, driven by a 33% increase in digital revenue. Performance revenue remained challenged by COVID due to the closure of bars, restaurants, clubs and concerts. Sync was on the upswing, growing 12% as TV and film production resumed. In Q2, Warner Chappell had a share in 23 #1s across the radio streaming and Billboard U.S. charts. We were also honored with the ASCAP Pop Publisher of the Year award. The value proposition that Warner Chappell offers songwriters has never been more relevant. We've become the destination of choice for exceptional talent. We've done this by building a culture centered on growing careers and creating long-term value. With our best-in-class creative services team, global infrastructure and a suite of tech tools, we've been able to distinguish ourselves. This has enabled us to retain big names like Saweetie, signed international stars like Jorge Drexler and established partnerships with labels like Love Renaissance. I've said repeatedly that music can come from anywhere and resonate everywhere. As we continue to grow our business across the globe, our focus is on culturally dynamic markets. We seek out vibrant music scenes with sustained growth in music consumption. Last year, we launched new offices in countries with massive untapped promises such as India, Vietnam, Peru and Turkey. This year, we've continued to expand our global reach. In Q2 alone, we made investments in markets that have vast growth potential, given their combined population of almost 3 billion people. In China, we signed a multiyear licensing agreement and created a new joint venture label with Tencent Music. In Russia, we've extended our #1 market share position through the acquisition of Zhara Music, now rebranded as Atlantic Records Russia. In the Middle East, we announced our investment and partnership with Rotana, the leading independent music label in the Arab world. In Africa, we recently appointed Temi Adeniji as our operating head for South Africa as well as strategy for the continent. Temi and her team will continue to focus on growing our investments and partnerships with Africa's best independent players. They will also be providing local artists with the amplification support needed to reach global audiences. We're focused on maximizing our artists' and songwriters' reach and revenue across all fandom touch points whether it's a snippet on social media, a soundtrack to an in-home workout, a live performance in a metaverse or an NFT digital collectible. These points show how the music ecosystem is broadening and deepening its relationship with people everywhere. Here are some recent examples of this strategy in action. Over the last few years, we've built up a network of award-winning media brands. To further accelerate the growth and monetization of these brands, we promoted Ben Blank to President of Media at WEA. Ben will lead our newly formed digital advertising creative content division. All of our owned and operated brands, UPROXX, Songkick and HipHopDX, will retain their editorial dependent -- independence and will benefit from a unified approach to ad sales and campaigns. We recently engaged the creativity of the Roblox community through 2 immersive experiences. We held an album launch party for Why Don't We, and Royal Blood performed at the Bloxy Awards. Both of these experiences have drawn millions of fans who were able to interact with virtual environments via their avatars. As we continue to explore new ways to connect artists and plans, we look forward to delivering events on a more frequent and bigger scale. Just yesterday, we announced a groundbreaking alliance and investment in Wave, the leader in virtual entertainment. Through this partnership, Wave will collaborate with WMG to develop virtual performances, experiences and monetization opportunities for our global roster. This includes exploring new forms of ticketing, sponsorship and in-show interactions. We're already working on a number of really exciting events scheduled over the next year. We were early to see that music would be fertile ground for digital collectibles. In 2019, we made an investment in Dapper Labs, the creators of NBA Top Shot. Last September, we began to experiment in this market, collaborating with Dapper to release 2 NFT CryptoKitties, inspired by Warner Records rock band, Muse. Last week, we announced an innovative new partnership with the world's largest avatar company, Genies. This partnership will enable our artists to sell exclusive digital wearables directly to their fans. Our goal is to develop authentic, quality and environmentally conscious products that build long-term fandom relationships. While it's still early days for this space, we're enthusiastic about its potential. Finally, I want to personally thank all of our Warner Music Group colleagues, artists, songwriters and partners for their incredible contributions to helping our company thrive over the past year. We're confident that the music entertainment industry will emerge from the pandemic with a renewed spirit of inventiveness and collaboration. All of us at WMG continue to look to the future with a tremendous amount of excitement and enthusiasm. With that, I'll turn it over to Eric.\nEric Levin: Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter performance was highlighted by new releases that performed well across formats, continued acceleration in revenue from emerging streaming platforms and thoughtful cost management. This translated into impressive growth across most key financial metrics, including strong free cash flow conversion. Moving to our results in the quarter. Total revenue was up approximately 13% on a constant currency basis and up 17% on an as-reported basis compared to the prior year quarter. Artist services and Recorded Music and performance in Music Publishing were the areas most affected by COVID due to the cancellation or postponement of touring. If you exclude those areas, our revenue grew 16% on a constant currency basis and 20% on an as-reported basis compared to the prior year quarter. Both adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EBITDA saw significant year-over-year increases, reflecting strong operating performance as we continue to shift from physical to digital. Adjusted OIBDA increased over 21% to $255 million with margin improving to over 20%. This improvement was driven by revenue mix, lower stock-based compensation and other related expenses and cost management initiatives. Adjusted EBITDA increased over 25% to $268 million with margin improving from 20% to 21.4%. The increase was largely due to the same factors that drove our adjusted OIBDA performance. Please refer to our press release for calculations and reconciliations related to adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EBITDA. In Recorded Music, Q2 revenue increased approximately 13% over the prior year quarter. Digital revenue grew 18% driven by a 20% increase in streaming. Streaming as a category saw growth across all key components with both subscription and ad-supported streaming growing double digits. Growth in revenue from emerging streaming platform continues to meaningfully outpace the broader streaming category. As Steve mentioned, we are now generating more than $200 million in annualized revenue from these platforms. Physical revenue increased by an impressive 19%, driven primarily by increased demand for vinyl and releases from The Yellow Monkey, Neil Young and Fleetwood Mac. Licensing revenue declined twice -- 12% as growth in sync was more than offset by lower broadcast fees. Artist services revenue, which includes tour-related merchandising as well as direct-to-consumer e-tailer EMP, declined 3%. While revenue related to concert promotion and tour-related merchandising significantly declined year-over-year, EMP saw continued healthy revenue growth of over 44% as limited access to brick-and-mortar stores in Europe drove online shopping. For Q2, Recorded Music adjusted OIBDA increased by more than 27% over the prior year quarter to $242 million due to revenue mix, cost savings and the impact from our recent acquisitions. Adjusted OIBDA margin increased 2 percentage points to 22.9%. Music Publishing revenue increased by approximately 12% as growth in digital and sync revenue more than offset declines in performance and mechanical revenue. Digital revenue increased by more than 33%, reflecting the continuing shift to streaming and timing of new deals with digital service providers. Synchronization revenue increased by 12% due to increasing motion picture and commercial income. The decline in performance revenue was primarily due to COVID, while the decline in mechanical revenue reflects continuing shift to streaming. Music Publishing adjusted OIBDA decreased by 6% from $49 million to $46 million with margins declining from 29.5% to 24%. Those declines were attributable to the timing of a nonrecurring benefit from the prior year quarter as well as the impact of revenue mix, driven by the reduction of high -- reduction in high-margin performance revenue due to COVID. Operating cash flow grew by 74%, increasing to $150 million compared to $86 million in the prior year quarter. This improvement was driven by strong operating performance, timing of working capital, including payments from certain digital service providers and timing of royalties. Free cash flow increased to $89 million from $67 million in the prior year quarter. CapEx was $20 million compared to $13 million in the prior year quarter. The increase is related to our previously announced plans to upgrade our IT and finance infrastructure. The total investment associated with our financial transformation program is expected to be about $20 million in fiscal '21 with annualized run rate savings of approximately $35 million to $40 million once fully implemented in -- for 2023. For fiscal '21, we expect total CapEx to be in the range of $90 million to $100 million. Cash taxes were $35 million in the quarter. And as of March 31, we had a cash balance of $588 million and net debt of approximately $2.8 billion. On January 20, we completed an amendment to our term loan credit agreement. The amendment extends the maturity from November 1, 2023 to January 20, 2028, and removes a number of negative covenants. In April, we refinanced our 5.5% notes through the issuance of $325 million of incremental term loan B, reducing our blended cost of debt to 3.4% and extending our maturities. In closing, we are extremely proud of our first half results and look forward to delivering an exciting slate of new music over the rest of the year. We thank you for joining our call today, and we'll now open the call to questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kutgun Maral with RBC Capital Markets.\nKutgun Maral: Congratulations on the results, particularly with the strong streaming momentum. I know you don't give guidance, but going forward, as you look at what seems to be an increasingly competitive landscape with some large players aggressively pursuing acquisitions, are you concerned about your outlook going forward?\nSteve Cooper: Thanks for the question, Kutgun. The short answer is not at all. We're really very confident about our competitive position, and I think that Q2 results are really a great signal of what's to come through this year and beyond. It's important to recognize that we are recording these revenues and EBITDA while we have maintained really rigorous financial discipline. We're one of the few music companies in the world that can really both buy and build in a universe of opportunity that's exploding right now. That's true for our A&R with everyone from emerging artists and songwriting talent to global superstars and music legends. It's true for our M&A activities. Look at our investments in territories like Russia and Africa or the acquisition of owned and operated channels like EMP and IMGN. It's true for our technology, where our tools, like our proprietary A&R apps, Sodatone, or our partnerships with innovative brands like Roblox, Genies or Wave continue to grow. Bottom line is we have what everybody wants, which is the best music in the world. And what continues to make us unique is the combination of our scale and agility. We've really got a number of really incredible releases coming over the rest of the year. So I expect our momentum to grow, and to be frank, the whole organization as we see what we've got teed up and as we begin to come out of COVID are really, really fired up.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Uerkwitz with Jefferies.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: I guess I just want to kind of see if you couldn't expand on some of these new opportunities. The announcements with Genie and Wave, how should we think about that TAM opportunity for virtual fan engagement? And kind of as a follow-up of all the new kind of opportunities that you've laid out, social, virtual platform for music, exercise and all these other things, like which one gets you most excited?\nEric Levin: Steve, do you want to take that? Or do you want me to take that?\nSteve Cooper: Yes. Yes, I'll take the first part, then you should chime in.\nEric Levin: Okay.\nSteve Cooper: First of all, thanks for the question, Andrew. We've got great expectations for the investments we make, and we make investments from the perspective of how can these help us amplify music? How can these investments amplify our touch points with fandom? How can these investments help us create and monetize new revenue streams for our artists? If you look at the investments we're making, they track, in many ways, the eyeballs and ears of billions of people around the world that are developing, creating and living in metaverses. And when you look at a number of our recent investments, all of them are focused on us having the tools, the technology and the access to these new worlds, Andrew, which we expect to continue to grow these worlds. We expect to continue to grow at meaningful double-digit numbers. So this is consistent with us wanting to ensure that we are able to effectively operate on every fandom touch point that should and will become available to our artists and songwriters. Hopefully, that answers your question from a strategic perspective.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: Yes, absolutely.\nEric Levin: If I can add to that just from perhaps a TAM and financial standpoint. So one of the things that we talked about is 3 years ago, these emerging forms of streamings revenue was approximately 0. One quarter ago, we said on an annualized basis, the revenue was running at about $150 million. Now this quarter, we're saying it's running on an annualized basis at $200 million. They are growing rapidly and growing more diverse, as Steve said. On your question about TAM, it's much more challenging but exciting in many ways to do it -- to compare this to, say, subscriptions where your TAM is your smartphone universe. Here, your TAM is your smartphone universe, but you potentially have multiple touch points, and therefore, multiple opportunities to monetize music within one smartphone is one user could use social media but also like to have live streams, participate in games, whether it's metaverses or otherwise, and with Genies utilize their avatars, they could also collect NFTs. And as you see from the range of partnerships that we put together, some are areas that are active in monetizing and well distributed already and others are really looking to the future and activating new forms of NFTs, whether it's with Dapper, where we've done some CryptoKitties for the band, Muse, or new activations that we're looking at. Getting our artists on Genie with avatars or working with Wave on live streams and new ways to monetize, the opportunity to expand this universe is really limited by the ability to create new products and continue the tremendous momentum to monetize. And we're excited about what's happening here and really focused on growing this universe. So thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.\nBen Swinburne: Maybe 2 questions. Eric, I know you guys don't give guidance, but I'll take a stab at it because you've had a strong first half of the year. And this year, I think you guys talked about back in November being back-half weighted. Obviously, you did -- I think it was 13% constant currency growth this quarter with some COVID headwinds, and you've talked about the release schedule in the back half. So do you think ex FX, revenue growth accelerates in the back half of the year versus what we've seen in the first half? That's the first. And then Steve, you mentioned Ben's promotion and sort of your initiatives in media. It got a decent amount of press coverage. I guess most of us don't think about Warner as an advertising business in terms of actually selling ads and creating branded content. I was just wondering if you could talk about the strategy and if you can size the opportunity or if that's a business that you have today that maybe is bigger than we realized? Just any color would be great.\nEric Levin: Sure.\nSteve Cooper: Eric, why don't you go first? And then I'll respond.\nEric Levin: Yes. So I appreciate your shot at the guidance, Ben. We don't give the guidance, but certainly give color. At the beginning of this year, we said we expected a strong second half release schedule, and we continue to expect to have a strong second half release schedule. We've already seen singles coming out from Cardi B and Silk Sonic, Bruno Mars, Anderson Paak collaboration. There's more great music coming out that Steve mentioned earlier in his talk. So we're very excited about the second half of the year. We think the momentum and growth trajectory that we've been continuing to build even through COVID, we were fully managing our business for growth going forward. Although we don't give guidance, we're very excited about the second half of the year, Ben.\nSteve Cooper: So Ben, with respect to advertising -- excuse me, we've been in -- with all the pollen, I can barely speak anymore between the pollen and videos all day. We've been in the ad sales business for quite some time. We have a -- an ad sales seat on YouTube, where we are very active, and we have developed product for brands on a regular basis. What we've done historically is our operations have been engaged one by one in the ad selling and the brand support space. What we're now doing is consolidating all of our ad sales, all of our brand support and production capabilities under one leader so that we will have a unified, integrated package from the Warner Music Group by way of supporting agencies, brands, and frankly, crossovers with our artist roster. So we are evolving the way we approach those markets in order to give them one-stop shopping, so to speak, Ben.\nBen Swinburne: Got it. And I presume that means you think that business would grow faster, would be more substantial over time as a result of these changes? Or.\nSteve Cooper: Yes. Yes, because it is -- it will be -- strategies will be unified. Presentations will be far more effective and efficient. And we will give agencies, brands and others the ability to search and select across our global portfolio. So both on a global and a regional basis, this should make us a much stronger magnet for attracting revenue, ad revenue.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Morris with Guggenheim.\nMichael Morris: I have two questions. Maybe the first one for Eric is really about the long-term EBITDA or profit margin opportunity. You guys have had great expansion there, and you've talked about your discipline. I'm curious, I mean, it's just -- it is a very competitive industry. You need to appeal to artists and things of that nature. It's transparent. I mean how do you see the opportunity for EBITDA margin expansion over time? And is it somewhat have a lid on it by virtue of that transparency? And then my second topic is around the international investments that you made, 3 that you pointed out are pretty different in nature. And I'm hoping maybe you can expand a little bit on the magnitude of the opportunity for each independently? And also just what you bring in? Is it a matter of you bringing your existing sort of artist catalog and having new avenues to exploit that? Is it more a matter of you being able to go into these markets and help discover and expand the catalog or expand the -- your roster? Just curious as to what the growth path is for those investments.\nEric Levin: Sure. I can take these. So on our long-term EBITDA margin, we have been consistent that as we look out, call it, 3, 4 years, that we think low, perhaps low to mid-20s EBITDA margin is realistic. When we started to communicate, that is, before we really knew the impact of COVID and how long it would last, we were already -- so in 2019, our EBITDA margin, our adjusted EBITDA margin was 19%. This quarter, it's 21.4%. So we've already moved into low 20s. There are a couple of reasons for that. One is some of the COVID revenue streams that have -- or some of the revenues -- let's not called COVID -- some of the revenue streams that have been curtailed because of COVID, mostly related to live, our tour merch business, notably in the U.S. and our concert promotion businesses in Europe, which are not huge as a percent of our total business are low -- but they're also low-margin businesses. Don't have a huge effect on EBITDA, but if the revenues are in the short-term curtailed, they provided short-term upward lift to adjusted EBITDA. Our underlying business, with the exception of that, is running pretty much right on what we expected along the plans we expected. As the business moves to be more and more digital, we expected in Recorded Music that to drive a natural margin uplift, and we're seeing that. And we're also managing a series of cost-savings initiatives. We have a global cost-savings program that's working with our corporate, our Music Publishing and Recorded Music divisions to find efficiencies related to automation. And we are finding impact from that. We are generating new policies to make sure costs from real estate or travel are reduced, not just in the short term when we're out of the office from COVID but in the long term when we return. And as we've mentioned, we also have our financial transformation that once fully online is going to save us $35 million to $40 million a year. The combination of all these, even as we return from COVID and live comes back, hopefully later this year and into '22, will allow us to manage our business, we believe, successfully and maintain margins in the low 20s. And we will continue to work for that to be our long term, and then continue from there to look for opportunities to continue to even improve it from there. But we are managing on the plans that we've expected. We're always looking for technologies that allow us to drive further efficiency into our business, and I'm sure we'll be managing this hard for the next several years and even beyond. With our investments, this quarter, we've had several types of investments. So we had international investments, which we mentioned, and investments in the digital future. This quarter, our investment in Zhara, which is -- was an independent Russia label that now is operating as Atlantic Russia, just cements our position as the #1 player in Russia, really allowing us to just broaden our A&R, broaden our roster, allow us to further drive music into a fast-growing market that we're truly excited about. Some of our other international investments, specifically in areas like the Middle East and Africa, we just see it as high-growth markets for the future. We're streaming, and digital is really coming online. And so whether it's Chocolate City in Nigeria that allows us to have local repertoire on the ground there or our investment in Africori distributor in the market just extends our reach and allows us to build our foothold in an expanding market with repertoire and distribution capabilities. And similarly, in the Middle East, we've launched offices so that we have owned and operated labels throughout the Middle East. We have an operation in Beirut that works pan-regional. We've launched our label group in Turkey. Our relationship in Rotana allows us to both have a strong partnership with a leading player in the market, but also have global distribution rights to their music outside of the mid-East region, allowing us to take advantage of that rapidly growing segment of the market. So we continue to look for opportunities to find emerging markets that are coming online with streaming and invest in their growth as the monetization opportunities become real. We are really very focused on investing where there's a financial return. So we really try to identify fast-growing markets and invest into that growth, noting we're also doing investments in the digital ecosystem. And obviously, we've invested in Roblox, and we're doing a lot with them to experiment with live streams and how to activate those with monetizations, Wave, Genies. These are some of the leaders in the digital ecosystem, and we really want to be in on the front edge, making sure that music is getting all the attention it deserves, has these digital activations. Both are reaching millions of people around the world, but also finding the right long-term monetization model that's both satisfying the music fans and rewarding to our artists. So we're really kind of engaged across all of these fronts. Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America.\nJessica Reif: A couple of questions. First, physical was surprisingly strong. Was that all Japan? And what's the outlook for physical in general? And then secondly, Music Publishing, it feels like there's still a deal a day that's been going on for a couple of years. Can you talk about your appetite for Music Publishing at this point, given elevated acquisition multiples? And you had some acquisitions in the last couple of quarters. How much did that contribute this year? How much is, I guess, organic growth versus how much did acquisitions add?\nEric Levin: Sure. Steve, if you want, I can tackle some of this, and you could add on whatever strategic color at the end. So physical, look, we had a 19% growth quarter, a strong growth quarter for physical. Vinyl is a growth segment within physical. And so we're looking for releases and activations to really unlock that potential. Some of that was Japan, specifically The Yellow Monkey release was very strong in Japan. But we've also had terrific release -- rereleases from our catalog of Fleetwood Mac's Rumours and from Neil Young's classic releases that allowed us to tap into that market as well. Overall, I think we still have to be cautious about physical. The CD market is still in decline. There are an opportunity based on release schedule to have strong quarters. But I would say, overall, we should expect physicals in decline, but we will be working very hard to maximize its potential, both through CDs, but especially in vinyl, which is a long-term attractive market that's growing. In Music Publishing, why don't I tackle that last because I suspect Steve will want to add on to that? On M&A, the transactions we did earlier this year, Jessica, contributed $11 million to adjusted EBITDA. So we've had a strong growth quarter excluding those. But obviously, they were additive as well. And I would just say, in Music Publishing, that we are a full-service operator in -- with Warner Chappell. We both are able to sign songwriters very, very early in their careers, help them develop their songwriting skills, pair them with other cowriters, help them pitch their songs to superstar artists. So we are not just an acquirer, we are active in developing. And that is a huge part of our business at Warner Chappell. But we're also very disciplined investor. We do look at the deals that come in the market. We do close deals when they have the proper financial return. And because we're able to look at deals across all genres, across all geographies around the world, we have found no shortage of attractive investments to make. But yes, there are a lot of deals happening there. And if the deal ever gets passed, the points that we think the return profile is attractive to us relative to our other opportunities and relative to our return threshold that will pass and find other deals. We are not finding a shortage of attractive investment opportunities to continue to grow Warner Chappell's business. Steve, I don't know if there's anything you want to add, but I think I answered the question.\nSteve Cooper: Yes. Jessica, I think Eric touched on all of the high points. But we have been engaged in these acquisitions. As importantly, we are providing an array of services to many of these acquirers because most of the people coming into this market are making these investments are pure financial players. But the fact of the matter is that these assets have to be managed. And one of the services we provide is actually the management of these portfolios to these third-party buyers. So I'd like to point that out. Number two, when we emphasize our financial discipline, it's not only what we have to do to grow the top line and the bottom line, but it's also to ensure that our cash flow from operations remains very, very healthy. And one of the things we are really thoughtful and disciplined about is not buying assets at multiples that will create or severely crimp cash flow from operations. So when we look at our metrics and we look at the multiples that some of these deals go at, very candidly, we look at those deals and say, we can't make them work. And we can't make them work because we've got a real cost of capital. We pay dividends to our shareholders. We've got to maintain a healthy cash flow from operations. So if we can't figure out how to really optimize in all of the right ways some of these deals in the marketplace, we just take a pass. Hopefully, that answers your question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein.\nTodd Juenger: I've got really just one topic. Probably love to hear Steve's thoughts. I think, Eric, you might have a few things to chime in, too. The topic is data, especially in an increasingly sort of digital world, you have all sorts of business and channel partners who are developing repositories of data about listening and listeners and fans and your artists, I mean, just to name some, right? So your streaming DSPs are developing their own data. The ticketing services and live-event managers are developing -- well, at least in a non-COVID world, are developing data. Obviously, the 3 -- the social platforms and gaming platforms are developing all this data. And I'm sure you have your own first-party data. So I guess my question or the topic is there's a perception among the investors that this data is very valuable. So is that true? Do you find a lot of value in any of this data? And is any of this data particularly valuable to you versus some of it that may be sort of redundant or more nice to have? And I guess, Eric, where you might especially come in for a financial audience here is if this stuff is valuable, how are you obtaining assets to -- access to it? Are you ever explicitly paying for data sets? Or are you ensuring access to data you need from your partners in your agreements in other -- with other forms of consideration? And how are you making sure that, that's part of the agreements that you have with your partners?\nSteve Cooper: So Eric, why don't I start, and then you can make all the points, which I am sure on this. So Todd, just to give you a sense of the Warner Music Group, we process 2 billion lines of data every day, and that's growing. So data, I guess, philosophically, you start with it's not so much the data that's important, it's what you can glean out of the data by way of useful information and really informative insights that make sense. When people talk about data oceans, they're literally talking about oceans. And the trick is to be able to organize that data not only -- if you look at data like the Pacific Ocean, while it's important to analyze from 0 to 15 feet, you got to be able to organize, categorize and pull really useful information and really, really great insights from not only 0 to 15 feet in the Pacific Ocean, but all the way down to the Marianas Trench. And so data without the right organization, categorization and algorithms to identify these -- the really useful stuff and the real insights isn't worth much in itself. That being said, we get data on a daily basis from hundreds upon hundreds of sources. And you're right that everybody has got their own data. What makes us different is we're an aggregator of data across all of these platforms. We get data from Live Nation. We get it from Spotify, Apple, YouTube and Deezer, Facebook, TikTok, on and on and on. And while they have and they can analyze their data, it's only one of the cut facets of the diamond, Todd, we actually have the data and the sourcing that allows us to look at every facet of the diamond. So you got to keep in mind that one of the services we provide to our artists and songwriters is data aggregation, which, given our internal data scientists and the way we mine this data, so to speak, allows us to provide them with useful information, and oftentimes, really interesting insights. Is data helpful when you can organize and manage that way? Absolutely. It allows us to -- when they return, it allows us to run far more effectively our marketing and promotion operations because we can focus on where our artist fans are, what they want and what more they are demanding. So the unequivocal answer is data when handled in a proper way does have a lot of value. Incidentally, one of our mantras whenever we do deals is no data, no deal. Eric, you may want to add to that?\nEric Levin: The only thing I want to add -- Steve, I thought that was right on the money. The only thing I want to add is or just supplement is we do have a series of tools that use all this data, which is to really power our decision and help our experts make the most efficient decisions in real-time. We have Sodatone, which is our A&R tool, which allows our A&R executives to see music that's flickering at the early stages and artists that are just getting started to see which artists we should meet and potentially sign and help develop their music and their careers. We have OPUS, which is our marketing tool. That helps us use tool about music that's already in the market to decide where and how best to promote it so that we're driving the most efficient, both use of our marketing resources to drive music performance in the market. Steve mentioned we have artist portals that allow artists to see how their music is performing and where in the market. We have song-pitching tools. We have sync tools. So we have a series of tools that use both internally generated and externally generated data across hundreds of sources to make sure we're running our business in the most effective way we can. And we continue to upgrade our data and our tools to make sure that we're using these in ways that are driving real outcomes to us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Thornton with Truist Securities.\nMatthew Thornton: Maybe a couple really quick ones if I could, I guess. The first one, Spotify, obviously, is in the midst of raising prices. And relatively, my question is, maybe for Steve, do you have any sense as to -- or any expectation as to whether other DSPs will follow suit? And is there any reason why price increases from the DSPs wouldn't flow through commensurately in parallel to your streaming business? So I guess that's kind of my first question. And then just second question around live music. There's been talk of maybe around like theme parks and things like that, there's been talk of pent-up demand as we kind of recover and kind of come out of COVID. I'm wondering if you have any evidence of pent-up demand around live concerts, festivals, et cetera? Anything you can point to there? Any color there would be great.\nSteve Cooper: Well, on the first, I'll give you my sense, and then Eric can follow up on many of the financial ramifications. Let me take the second first so. I think there's a general view, Matthew, that there is pent-up demand for live. I'm sure you saw the sellout crowd in New Orleans a week-or-so ago for the UFC championships. There had been large crowds at kind of managed events over the last couple of months. When New Zealand opened for live concerts, there was a surge in demand. So I think one would just logically conclude that there is a pent-up demand. I would also say that over the last 12, 13, 14, 15 months, I think we should also expect changes in behavior, where if historically, 100 people wanted to go to a concert -- I'm obviously making these numbers up, there will now be 10 or 15 or 20 who will have concerns, lingering concerns about live and large crowds and will continue to double down on the habits created during COVID by way of watching things on live streams or by watching virtual concerts and interacting in different ways. So I think that while there is pent-up demand, there may be some behavioral changes just because of the lingering uncertainties around COVID. With respect to price increases, I think that, that's -- Spotify has announced a number of price increases for a variety of their offerings in emerging markets, developing markets. They now announced in the U.S. and, I believe, the U.K. I think that as -- what people have a tendency to do on these services is build their library, build their playlists, and so there is a stickiness. And I think that as Spotify and/or others experiment with these price increases, if they don't see any meaningful churn events, and to date, we're not aware of any. But to the extent that they don't see any meaningful churn events, I think what we should have an expectation about is that other DSPs will begin to raise their prices as well. Keep in mind that there is a massive, massive gap between pricing for audio, so definitely pricing for their ears than there is pricing for video or eyeballs. And I think that our long-term expectations are that the gap between audio and video will have to erode, Matthew. They may never be on a par with each other, but we do believe that audio will have to make incremental gains over time relative to the value proposition that's associated with video. Hopefully, that was -- that answers your question, Matthew. And Eric, you should add anything you want to add.\nEric Levin: No. Steve, I thought you covered it very well.\nMatthew Thornton: I guess just.\nSteve Cooper: Sorry, what was that?\nMatthew Thornton: Question just for Eric, I guess. Is there any reason -- when a DSP raises price, I would expect that the impact to your business happens in parallel and commensurately. Is there any reason that, that wouldn't be the case? I just want to clarify that.\nEric Levin: Thank you. I would just say we don't talk about specific DSP deals. So I don't want to get granular, but I would say, in general, when retail rates go up in the market that in general, we would expect to share and participate in that incremental upside, yes.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Jason Bazinet with Citi.\nJason Bazinet: Your business is so interesting because for many, many years, it was in decline as physical collapsed, and now you're in sort of secular growth as the digital pivot is underway. And I think what's hard in that sort of 2-decade context is to get a sense of, on a full year basis, if you happen to have a bunch of hit records or hit artists that are on your roster, what it really means on a, let's say, a full year basis in terms of growth? In other words, market share gains or losses. Is it sort of -- am I right to sort of think of it as like bull case 1 or 2 points, bear case 1 or 2 points as a headwind or a tailwind in any given year. Is that a reasonable number?\nEric Levin: Thanks, Jason. I would say that it's -- music, certainly now, and I haven't been in the music business for 20 years, I've been in it for 7. But I would say that there's a bit of a multipronged, multilayered analysis to it. So one, music has just become very global. We're releasing music in 50 markets around the world. And one can have really strong releases in Japan and Germany, and that could be really impactful, or one can have some of our big, kind of Anglo global superstars release music, and it could be really impactful. We could have a series of different ways to drive music and performance in the marketplace. So I would say that we have multiple tools. We certainly have -- which I think you were talking to kind of the global superstars that really have an opportunity to have an impact on the global music market. But we also have local and regional stars, and new stars we're developing and breaking all the time that have a real impact. And so a lot of this is a portfolio of -- across genres, artists across different stages of their career. We always take great pride in our ability to identify and develop and market the next generation of superstars and drive them into the market and have long-term relationships there, hopefully, what we plan for long-term careers. And we do this all over the world, in Asia, Latin America, Europe, and obviously, in the U.S. and U.K. as well. So I do think that individual artists have the ability to move the market, as you said, by maybe a point or so. But overall, we look at a very, very deep and broad portfolio every year regardless of which names are on it and making sure we're releasing great music. And if we're releasing great music, we're confident that we can drive the performance and growth in our business that we expect. And we've been doing that for the past 7, 8 years at this point.\nOperator: I would now like to turn the call back over to Steve Cooper for closing remarks.\nSteve Cooper: So again, I want to thank everybody for taking the time to join us today. And please, everyone stay safe, and have a really good time enjoying Cinco de Mayo. We'll talk to you in a few months. Bye-bye.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Eric Levin",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter performance was highlighted by new releases that performed well across formats, continued acceleration in revenue from emerging streaming platforms and thoughtful cost management. This translated into impressive growth across most key financial metrics, including strong free cash flow conversion. Moving to our results in the quarter. Total revenue was up approximately 13% on a constant currency basis and up 17% on an as-reported basis compared to the prior year quarter. Artist services and Recorded Music and performance in Music Publishing were the areas most affected by COVID due to the cancellation or postponement of touring. If you exclude those areas, our revenue grew 16% on a constant currency basis and 20% on an as-reported basis compared to the prior year quarter. Both adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EBITDA saw significant year-over-year increases, reflecting strong operating performance as we continue to shift from physical to digital. Adjusted OIBDA increased over 21% to $255 million with margin improving to over 20%. This improvement was driven by revenue mix, lower stock-based compensation and other related expenses and cost management initiatives. Adjusted EBITDA increased over 25% to $268 million with margin improving from 20% to 21.4%. The increase was largely due to the same factors that drove our adjusted OIBDA performance. Please refer to our press release for calculations and reconciliations related to adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EBITDA. In Recorded Music, Q2 revenue increased approximately 13% over the prior year quarter. Digital revenue grew 18% driven by a 20% increase in streaming. Streaming as a category saw growth across all key components with both subscription and ad-supported streaming growing double digits. Growth in revenue from emerging streaming platform continues to meaningfully outpace the broader streaming category. As Steve mentioned, we are now generating more than $200 million in annualized revenue from these platforms. Physical revenue increased by an impressive 19%, driven primarily by increased demand for vinyl and releases from The Yellow Monkey, Neil Young and Fleetwood Mac. Licensing revenue declined twice -- 12% as growth in sync was more than offset by lower broadcast fees. Artist services revenue, which includes tour-related merchandising as well as direct-to-consumer e-tailer EMP, declined 3%. While revenue related to concert promotion and tour-related merchandising significantly declined year-over-year, EMP saw continued healthy revenue growth of over 44% as limited access to brick-and-mortar stores in Europe drove online shopping. For Q2, Recorded Music adjusted OIBDA increased by more than 27% over the prior year quarter to $242 million due to revenue mix, cost savings and the impact from our recent acquisitions. Adjusted OIBDA margin increased 2 percentage points to 22.9%. Music Publishing revenue increased by approximately 12% as growth in digital and sync revenue more than offset declines in performance and mechanical revenue. Digital revenue increased by more than 33%, reflecting the continuing shift to streaming and timing of new deals with digital service providers. Synchronization revenue increased by 12% due to increasing motion picture and commercial income. The decline in performance revenue was primarily due to COVID, while the decline in mechanical revenue reflects continuing shift to streaming. Music Publishing adjusted OIBDA decreased by 6% from $49 million to $46 million with margins declining from 29.5% to 24%. Those declines were attributable to the timing of a nonrecurring benefit from the prior year quarter as well as the impact of revenue mix, driven by the reduction of high -- reduction in high-margin performance revenue due to COVID. Operating cash flow grew by 74%, increasing to $150 million compared to $86 million in the prior year quarter. This improvement was driven by strong operating performance, timing of working capital, including payments from certain digital service providers and timing of royalties. Free cash flow increased to $89 million from $67 million in the prior year quarter. CapEx was $20 million compared to $13 million in the prior year quarter. The increase is related to our previously announced plans to upgrade our IT and finance infrastructure. The total investment associated with our financial transformation program is expected to be about $20 million in fiscal '21 with annualized run rate savings of approximately $35 million to $40 million once fully implemented in -- for 2023. For fiscal '21, we expect total CapEx to be in the range of $90 million to $100 million. Cash taxes were $35 million in the quarter. And as of March 31, we had a cash balance of $588 million and net debt of approximately $2.8 billion. On January 20, we completed an amendment to our term loan credit agreement. The amendment extends the maturity from November 1, 2023 to January 20, 2028, and removes a number of negative covenants. In April, we refinanced our 5.5% notes through the issuance of $325 million of incremental term loan B, reducing our blended cost of debt to 3.4% and extending our maturities. In closing, we are extremely proud of our first half results and look forward to delivering an exciting slate of new music over the rest of the year. We thank you for joining our call today, and we'll now open the call to questions. Steve, do you want to take that? Or do you want me to take that? Okay. If I can add to that just from perhaps a TAM and financial standpoint. So one of the things that we talked about is 3 years ago, these emerging forms of streamings revenue was approximately 0. One quarter ago, we said on an annualized basis, the revenue was running at about $150 million. Now this quarter, we're saying it's running on an annualized basis at $200 million. They are growing rapidly and growing more diverse, as Steve said. On your question about TAM, it's much more challenging but exciting in many ways to do it -- to compare this to, say, subscriptions where your TAM is your smartphone universe. Here, your TAM is your smartphone universe, but you potentially have multiple touch points, and therefore, multiple opportunities to monetize music within one smartphone is one user could use social media but also like to have live streams, participate in games, whether it's metaverses or otherwise, and with Genies utilize their avatars, they could also collect NFTs. And as you see from the range of partnerships that we put together, some are areas that are active in monetizing and well distributed already and others are really looking to the future and activating new forms of NFTs, whether it's with Dapper, where we've done some CryptoKitties for the band, Muse, or new activations that we're looking at. Getting our artists on Genie with avatars or working with Wave on live streams and new ways to monetize, the opportunity to expand this universe is really limited by the ability to create new products and continue the tremendous momentum to monetize. And we're excited about what's happening here and really focused on growing this universe. So thank you. Sure. Yes. So I appreciate your shot at the guidance, Ben. We don't give the guidance, but certainly give color. At the beginning of this year, we said we expected a strong second half release schedule, and we continue to expect to have a strong second half release schedule. We've already seen singles coming out from Cardi B and Silk Sonic, Bruno Mars, Anderson Paak collaboration. There's more great music coming out that Steve mentioned earlier in his talk. So we're very excited about the second half of the year. We think the momentum and growth trajectory that we've been continuing to build even through COVID, we were fully managing our business for growth going forward. Although we don't give guidance, we're very excited about the second half of the year, Ben. Sure. I can take these. So on our long-term EBITDA margin, we have been consistent that as we look out, call it, 3, 4 years, that we think low, perhaps low to mid-20s EBITDA margin is realistic. When we started to communicate, that is, before we really knew the impact of COVID and how long it would last, we were already -- so in 2019, our EBITDA margin, our adjusted EBITDA margin was 19%. This quarter, it's 21.4%. So we've already moved into low 20s. There are a couple of reasons for that. One is some of the COVID revenue streams that have -- or some of the revenues -- let's not called COVID -- some of the revenue streams that have been curtailed because of COVID, mostly related to live, our tour merch business, notably in the U.S. and our concert promotion businesses in Europe, which are not huge as a percent of our total business are low -- but they're also low-margin businesses. Don't have a huge effect on EBITDA, but if the revenues are in the short-term curtailed, they provided short-term upward lift to adjusted EBITDA. Our underlying business, with the exception of that, is running pretty much right on what we expected along the plans we expected. As the business moves to be more and more digital, we expected in Recorded Music that to drive a natural margin uplift, and we're seeing that. And we're also managing a series of cost-savings initiatives. We have a global cost-savings program that's working with our corporate, our Music Publishing and Recorded Music divisions to find efficiencies related to automation. And we are finding impact from that. We are generating new policies to make sure costs from real estate or travel are reduced, not just in the short term when we're out of the office from COVID but in the long term when we return. And as we've mentioned, we also have our financial transformation that once fully online is going to save us $35 million to $40 million a year. The combination of all these, even as we return from COVID and live comes back, hopefully later this year and into '22, will allow us to manage our business, we believe, successfully and maintain margins in the low 20s. And we will continue to work for that to be our long term, and then continue from there to look for opportunities to continue to even improve it from there. But we are managing on the plans that we've expected. We're always looking for technologies that allow us to drive further efficiency into our business, and I'm sure we'll be managing this hard for the next several years and even beyond. With our investments, this quarter, we've had several types of investments. So we had international investments, which we mentioned, and investments in the digital future. This quarter, our investment in Zhara, which is -- was an independent Russia label that now is operating as Atlantic Russia, just cements our position as the #1 player in Russia, really allowing us to just broaden our A&R, broaden our roster, allow us to further drive music into a fast-growing market that we're truly excited about. Some of our other international investments, specifically in areas like the Middle East and Africa, we just see it as high-growth markets for the future. We're streaming, and digital is really coming online. And so whether it's Chocolate City in Nigeria that allows us to have local repertoire on the ground there or our investment in Africori distributor in the market just extends our reach and allows us to build our foothold in an expanding market with repertoire and distribution capabilities. And similarly, in the Middle East, we've launched offices so that we have owned and operated labels throughout the Middle East. We have an operation in Beirut that works pan-regional. We've launched our label group in Turkey. Our relationship in Rotana allows us to both have a strong partnership with a leading player in the market, but also have global distribution rights to their music outside of the mid-East region, allowing us to take advantage of that rapidly growing segment of the market. So we continue to look for opportunities to find emerging markets that are coming online with streaming and invest in their growth as the monetization opportunities become real. We are really very focused on investing where there's a financial return. So we really try to identify fast-growing markets and invest into that growth, noting we're also doing investments in the digital ecosystem. And obviously, we've invested in Roblox, and we're doing a lot with them to experiment with live streams and how to activate those with monetizations, Wave, Genies. These are some of the leaders in the digital ecosystem, and we really want to be in on the front edge, making sure that music is getting all the attention it deserves, has these digital activations. Both are reaching millions of people around the world, but also finding the right long-term monetization model that's both satisfying the music fans and rewarding to our artists. So we're really kind of engaged across all of these fronts. Thanks, Michael. Sure. Steve, if you want, I can tackle some of this, and you could add on whatever strategic color at the end. So physical, look, we had a 19% growth quarter, a strong growth quarter for physical. Vinyl is a growth segment within physical. And so we're looking for releases and activations to really unlock that potential. Some of that was Japan, specifically The Yellow Monkey release was very strong in Japan. But we've also had terrific release -- rereleases from our catalog of Fleetwood Mac's Rumours and from Neil Young's classic releases that allowed us to tap into that market as well. Overall, I think we still have to be cautious about physical. The CD market is still in decline. There are an opportunity based on release schedule to have strong quarters. But I would say, overall, we should expect physicals in decline, but we will be working very hard to maximize its potential, both through CDs, but especially in vinyl, which is a long-term attractive market that's growing. In Music Publishing, why don't I tackle that last because I suspect Steve will want to add on to that? On M&A, the transactions we did earlier this year, Jessica, contributed $11 million to adjusted EBITDA. So we've had a strong growth quarter excluding those. But obviously, they were additive as well. And I would just say, in Music Publishing, that we are a full-service operator in -- with Warner Chappell. We both are able to sign songwriters very, very early in their careers, help them develop their songwriting skills, pair them with other cowriters, help them pitch their songs to superstar artists. So we are not just an acquirer, we are active in developing. And that is a huge part of our business at Warner Chappell. But we're also very disciplined investor. We do look at the deals that come in the market. We do close deals when they have the proper financial return. And because we're able to look at deals across all genres, across all geographies around the world, we have found no shortage of attractive investments to make. But yes, there are a lot of deals happening there. And if the deal ever gets passed, the points that we think the return profile is attractive to us relative to our other opportunities and relative to our return threshold that will pass and find other deals. We are not finding a shortage of attractive investment opportunities to continue to grow Warner Chappell's business. Steve, I don't know if there's anything you want to add, but I think I answered the question. The only thing I want to add -- Steve, I thought that was right on the money. The only thing I want to add is or just supplement is we do have a series of tools that use all this data, which is to really power our decision and help our experts make the most efficient decisions in real-time. We have Sodatone, which is our A&R tool, which allows our A&R executives to see music that's flickering at the early stages and artists that are just getting started to see which artists we should meet and potentially sign and help develop their music and their careers. We have OPUS, which is our marketing tool. That helps us use tool about music that's already in the market to decide where and how best to promote it so that we're driving the most efficient, both use of our marketing resources to drive music performance in the market. Steve mentioned we have artist portals that allow artists to see how their music is performing and where in the market. We have song-pitching tools. We have sync tools. So we have a series of tools that use both internally generated and externally generated data across hundreds of sources to make sure we're running our business in the most effective way we can. And we continue to upgrade our data and our tools to make sure that we're using these in ways that are driving real outcomes to us. No. Steve, I thought you covered it very well. Thank you. I would just say we don't talk about specific DSP deals. So I don't want to get granular, but I would say, in general, when retail rates go up in the market that in general, we would expect to share and participate in that incremental upside, yes. Thanks, Jason. I would say that it's -- music, certainly now, and I haven't been in the music business for 20 years, I've been in it for 7. But I would say that there's a bit of a multipronged, multilayered analysis to it. So one, music has just become very global. We're releasing music in 50 markets around the world. And one can have really strong releases in Japan and Germany, and that could be really impactful, or one can have some of our big, kind of Anglo global superstars release music, and it could be really impactful. We could have a series of different ways to drive music and performance in the marketplace. So I would say that we have multiple tools. We certainly have -- which I think you were talking to kind of the global superstars that really have an opportunity to have an impact on the global music market. But we also have local and regional stars, and new stars we're developing and breaking all the time that have a real impact. And so a lot of this is a portfolio of -- across genres, artists across different stages of their career. We always take great pride in our ability to identify and develop and market the next generation of superstars and drive them into the market and have long-term relationships there, hopefully, what we plan for long-term careers. And we do this all over the world, in Asia, Latin America, Europe, and obviously, in the U.S. and U.K. as well. So I do think that individual artists have the ability to move the market, as you said, by maybe a point or so. But overall, we look at a very, very deep and broad portfolio every year regardless of which names are on it and making sure we're releasing great music. And if we're releasing great music, we're confident that we can drive the performance and growth in our business that we expect. And we've been doing that for the past 7, 8 years at this point."

            "name": "Steve Cooper",
            "content": "Thanks, Kareem. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As you know, we posted excellent results in our first quarter, and I'm very happy to say that trend continues to build momentum. When you consider that only the last 2 weeks of the prior year's quarter were affected by COVID, our results are even more impressive. At a time when our business is stronger than ever, we're lengthening our stride with chart-topping releases from many of our biggest artists and songwriters. Today, I'd like to cover 3 key topics: first, our quarterly results and all the great new music that's driving them; second, our expansion into new markets around the world; and finally, our use of new technologies and emerging streaming platforms to further accelerate our growth. Despite the ongoing pandemic, second quarter total revenue grew 13% year-over-year, underpinned by double-digit revenue growth in both Recorded Music and Music Publishing. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 25%. Margin improved to over 21%. Recorded Music delivered revenue growth of 13%, marked by double-digit growth in both digital and physical revenue. This growth more than offset the continued dislocation in artist services and licensing revenue. Recorded Music streaming revenue grew 20%, driven by successful new releases and strong carryover performances. Ad-supported streaming has now fully recovered and grew at a higher rate than it did pre-COVID. Revenue from emerging streaming platforms, such as Facebook, TikTok and Peloton, is now running at $200 million on an annualized basis. Physical revenue also saw a major resurgence, growing 19% year-over-year, primarily due to an uptick in vinyl demand. Our success in the quarter spanned label groups, genres and geographies. This growth underscored our global strength as well as the diversity of our artists and repertoire. Here are just a few high points. Atlantic scored a massive #1 single on a Billboard Hot 100 with Leave the Door Open, the first release from Silk Sonic, the new Bruno Mars and Anderson Paak collaboration. Cardi B also widened her lead for the most #1 songs among female rappers with the mega-hit Up. At Warner Records, breakout star, CJ, topped Billboard's Emerging Artist Chart with his single Whoopty. Meanwhile, Saweetie teamed up with Doja Cat on Best Friend, hitting the top 10 on Billboard's Hot R&B and hip-hop songs chart. Elektra's Masked Wolf scored an international smash with Astronaut in the Ocean, generating well over 400 million streams to date and climbing to #1 in 8 countries. At Warner Music Nashville, Gabby Barrett released the hit single, The Good Ones, the follow up to her 5x platinum debut single, I Hope. Three-peat Grammy winning duo, Dan + Shay, unleashed their new smash, Glad You Exist, and are currently tallying 40 million global streams per week. In Europe, The Snuts and Capo Plaza, both had #1 albums. Amazingly, 7 tracks from Capo's album landed in Italy's top 10. As we look to the rest of the year, our hot streak should continue with forthcoming albums from both emerging and established stars like Myke Towers, Quando Rondo, Coldplay, Silk Sonic and Cardi B. More releases from our roster of global superstars will be dropping later this year. In Music Publishing, we delivered strong revenue growth of 12%, driven by a 33% increase in digital revenue. Performance revenue remained challenged by COVID due to the closure of bars, restaurants, clubs and concerts. Sync was on the upswing, growing 12% as TV and film production resumed. In Q2, Warner Chappell had a share in 23 #1s across the radio streaming and Billboard U.S. charts. We were also honored with the ASCAP Pop Publisher of the Year award. The value proposition that Warner Chappell offers songwriters has never been more relevant. We've become the destination of choice for exceptional talent. We've done this by building a culture centered on growing careers and creating long-term value. With our best-in-class creative services team, global infrastructure and a suite of tech tools, we've been able to distinguish ourselves. This has enabled us to retain big names like Saweetie, signed international stars like Jorge Drexler and established partnerships with labels like Love Renaissance. I've said repeatedly that music can come from anywhere and resonate everywhere. As we continue to grow our business across the globe, our focus is on culturally dynamic markets. We seek out vibrant music scenes with sustained growth in music consumption. Last year, we launched new offices in countries with massive untapped promises such as India, Vietnam, Peru and Turkey. This year, we've continued to expand our global reach. In Q2 alone, we made investments in markets that have vast growth potential, given their combined population of almost 3 billion people. In China, we signed a multiyear licensing agreement and created a new joint venture label with Tencent Music. In Russia, we've extended our #1 market share position through the acquisition of Zhara Music, now rebranded as Atlantic Records Russia. In the Middle East, we announced our investment and partnership with Rotana, the leading independent music label in the Arab world. In Africa, we recently appointed Temi Adeniji as our operating head for South Africa as well as strategy for the continent. Temi and her team will continue to focus on growing our investments and partnerships with Africa's best independent players. They will also be providing local artists with the amplification support needed to reach global audiences. We're focused on maximizing our artists' and songwriters' reach and revenue across all fandom touch points whether it's a snippet on social media, a soundtrack to an in-home workout, a live performance in a metaverse or an NFT digital collectible. These points show how the music ecosystem is broadening and deepening its relationship with people everywhere. Here are some recent examples of this strategy in action. Over the last few years, we've built up a network of award-winning media brands. To further accelerate the growth and monetization of these brands, we promoted Ben Blank to President of Media at WEA. Ben will lead our newly formed digital advertising creative content division. All of our owned and operated brands, UPROXX, Songkick and HipHopDX, will retain their editorial dependent -- independence and will benefit from a unified approach to ad sales and campaigns. We recently engaged the creativity of the Roblox community through 2 immersive experiences. We held an album launch party for Why Don't We, and Royal Blood performed at the Bloxy Awards. Both of these experiences have drawn millions of fans who were able to interact with virtual environments via their avatars. As we continue to explore new ways to connect artists and plans, we look forward to delivering events on a more frequent and bigger scale. Just yesterday, we announced a groundbreaking alliance and investment in Wave, the leader in virtual entertainment. Through this partnership, Wave will collaborate with WMG to develop virtual performances, experiences and monetization opportunities for our global roster. This includes exploring new forms of ticketing, sponsorship and in-show interactions. We're already working on a number of really exciting events scheduled over the next year. We were early to see that music would be fertile ground for digital collectibles. In 2019, we made an investment in Dapper Labs, the creators of NBA Top Shot. Last September, we began to experiment in this market, collaborating with Dapper to release 2 NFT CryptoKitties, inspired by Warner Records rock band, Muse. Last week, we announced an innovative new partnership with the world's largest avatar company, Genies. This partnership will enable our artists to sell exclusive digital wearables directly to their fans. Our goal is to develop authentic, quality and environmentally conscious products that build long-term fandom relationships. While it's still early days for this space, we're enthusiastic about its potential. Finally, I want to personally thank all of our Warner Music Group colleagues, artists, songwriters and partners for their incredible contributions to helping our company thrive over the past year. We're confident that the music entertainment industry will emerge from the pandemic with a renewed spirit of inventiveness and collaboration. All of us at WMG continue to look to the future with a tremendous amount of excitement and enthusiasm. With that, I'll turn it over to Eric. Thanks for the question, Kutgun. The short answer is not at all. We're really very confident about our competitive position, and I think that Q2 results are really a great signal of what's to come through this year and beyond. It's important to recognize that we are recording these revenues and EBITDA while we have maintained really rigorous financial discipline. We're one of the few music companies in the world that can really both buy and build in a universe of opportunity that's exploding right now. That's true for our A&R with everyone from emerging artists and songwriting talent to global superstars and music legends. It's true for our M&A activities. Look at our investments in territories like Russia and Africa or the acquisition of owned and operated channels like EMP and IMGN. It's true for our technology, where our tools, like our proprietary A&R apps, Sodatone, or our partnerships with innovative brands like Roblox, Genies or Wave continue to grow. Bottom line is we have what everybody wants, which is the best music in the world. And what continues to make us unique is the combination of our scale and agility. We've really got a number of really incredible releases coming over the rest of the year. So I expect our momentum to grow, and to be frank, the whole organization as we see what we've got teed up and as we begin to come out of COVID are really, really fired up. Yes. Yes, I'll take the first part, then you should chime in. First of all, thanks for the question, Andrew. We've got great expectations for the investments we make, and we make investments from the perspective of how can these help us amplify music? How can these investments amplify our touch points with fandom? How can these investments help us create and monetize new revenue streams for our artists? If you look at the investments we're making, they track, in many ways, the eyeballs and ears of billions of people around the world that are developing, creating and living in metaverses. And when you look at a number of our recent investments, all of them are focused on us having the tools, the technology and the access to these new worlds, Andrew, which we expect to continue to grow these worlds. We expect to continue to grow at meaningful double-digit numbers. So this is consistent with us wanting to ensure that we are able to effectively operate on every fandom touch point that should and will become available to our artists and songwriters. Hopefully, that answers your question from a strategic perspective. Eric, why don't you go first? And then I'll respond. So Ben, with respect to advertising -- excuse me, we've been in -- with all the pollen, I can barely speak anymore between the pollen and videos all day. We've been in the ad sales business for quite some time. We have a -- an ad sales seat on YouTube, where we are very active, and we have developed product for brands on a regular basis. What we've done historically is our operations have been engaged one by one in the ad selling and the brand support space. What we're now doing is consolidating all of our ad sales, all of our brand support and production capabilities under one leader so that we will have a unified, integrated package from the Warner Music Group by way of supporting agencies, brands, and frankly, crossovers with our artist roster. So we are evolving the way we approach those markets in order to give them one-stop shopping, so to speak, Ben. Yes. Yes, because it is -- it will be -- strategies will be unified. Presentations will be far more effective and efficient. And we will give agencies, brands and others the ability to search and select across our global portfolio. So both on a global and a regional basis, this should make us a much stronger magnet for attracting revenue, ad revenue. Yes. Jessica, I think Eric touched on all of the high points. But we have been engaged in these acquisitions. As importantly, we are providing an array of services to many of these acquirers because most of the people coming into this market are making these investments are pure financial players. But the fact of the matter is that these assets have to be managed. And one of the services we provide is actually the management of these portfolios to these third-party buyers. So I'd like to point that out. Number two, when we emphasize our financial discipline, it's not only what we have to do to grow the top line and the bottom line, but it's also to ensure that our cash flow from operations remains very, very healthy. And one of the things we are really thoughtful and disciplined about is not buying assets at multiples that will create or severely crimp cash flow from operations. So when we look at our metrics and we look at the multiples that some of these deals go at, very candidly, we look at those deals and say, we can't make them work. And we can't make them work because we've got a real cost of capital. We pay dividends to our shareholders. We've got to maintain a healthy cash flow from operations. So if we can't figure out how to really optimize in all of the right ways some of these deals in the marketplace, we just take a pass. Hopefully, that answers your question. So Eric, why don't I start, and then you can make all the points, which I am sure on this. So Todd, just to give you a sense of the Warner Music Group, we process 2 billion lines of data every day, and that's growing. So data, I guess, philosophically, you start with it's not so much the data that's important, it's what you can glean out of the data by way of useful information and really informative insights that make sense. When people talk about data oceans, they're literally talking about oceans. And the trick is to be able to organize that data not only -- if you look at data like the Pacific Ocean, while it's important to analyze from 0 to 15 feet, you got to be able to organize, categorize and pull really useful information and really, really great insights from not only 0 to 15 feet in the Pacific Ocean, but all the way down to the Marianas Trench. And so data without the right organization, categorization and algorithms to identify these -- the really useful stuff and the real insights isn't worth much in itself. That being said, we get data on a daily basis from hundreds upon hundreds of sources. And you're right that everybody has got their own data. What makes us different is we're an aggregator of data across all of these platforms. We get data from Live Nation. We get it from Spotify, Apple, YouTube and Deezer, Facebook, TikTok, on and on and on. And while they have and they can analyze their data, it's only one of the cut facets of the diamond, Todd, we actually have the data and the sourcing that allows us to look at every facet of the diamond. So you got to keep in mind that one of the services we provide to our artists and songwriters is data aggregation, which, given our internal data scientists and the way we mine this data, so to speak, allows us to provide them with useful information, and oftentimes, really interesting insights. Is data helpful when you can organize and manage that way? Absolutely. It allows us to -- when they return, it allows us to run far more effectively our marketing and promotion operations because we can focus on where our artist fans are, what they want and what more they are demanding. So the unequivocal answer is data when handled in a proper way does have a lot of value. Incidentally, one of our mantras whenever we do deals is no data, no deal. Eric, you may want to add to that? Well, on the first, I'll give you my sense, and then Eric can follow up on many of the financial ramifications. Let me take the second first so. I think there's a general view, Matthew, that there is pent-up demand for live. I'm sure you saw the sellout crowd in New Orleans a week-or-so ago for the UFC championships. There had been large crowds at kind of managed events over the last couple of months. When New Zealand opened for live concerts, there was a surge in demand. So I think one would just logically conclude that there is a pent-up demand. I would also say that over the last 12, 13, 14, 15 months, I think we should also expect changes in behavior, where if historically, 100 people wanted to go to a concert -- I'm obviously making these numbers up, there will now be 10 or 15 or 20 who will have concerns, lingering concerns about live and large crowds and will continue to double down on the habits created during COVID by way of watching things on live streams or by watching virtual concerts and interacting in different ways. So I think that while there is pent-up demand, there may be some behavioral changes just because of the lingering uncertainties around COVID. With respect to price increases, I think that, that's -- Spotify has announced a number of price increases for a variety of their offerings in emerging markets, developing markets. They now announced in the U.S. and, I believe, the U.K. I think that as -- what people have a tendency to do on these services is build their library, build their playlists, and so there is a stickiness. And I think that as Spotify and/or others experiment with these price increases, if they don't see any meaningful churn events, and to date, we're not aware of any. But to the extent that they don't see any meaningful churn events, I think what we should have an expectation about is that other DSPs will begin to raise their prices as well. Keep in mind that there is a massive, massive gap between pricing for audio, so definitely pricing for their ears than there is pricing for video or eyeballs. And I think that our long-term expectations are that the gap between audio and video will have to erode, Matthew. They may never be on a par with each other, but we do believe that audio will have to make incremental gains over time relative to the value proposition that's associated with video. Hopefully, that was -- that answers your question, Matthew. And Eric, you should add anything you want to add. Sorry, what was that? So again, I want to thank everybody for taking the time to join us today. And please, everyone stay safe, and have a really good time enjoying Cinco de Mayo. We'll talk to you in a few months. Bye-bye."

Please note that our earnings press release, earnings snapshot and the Form 10-Q we filed this afternoon will be available on our website. On today\u2019s call, we have our CEO, Steve Cooper; and our Executive Vice President and CFO, Eric Levin, who will take you through our results and then we will take your questions. Before Steve\u2019s comments, I would like to refer you to the second slide of the earnings presentation to remind you that this communication includes forward-looking statements that reflect the current views of Warner Music Group about future events and financial performance. We plan to present certain non-GAAP results during this conference call and the new earnings snapshot slides posted on our website. We have provided schedules reconciling these results to our GAAP results in our earnings press release posted on our website. Also, please note that all revenue figures and comparisons discussed today will be presented in constant currency, unless otherwise noted. All forward-looking statements are made as of today, and we disclaim any duty to update such statements. Our expectations, beliefs and projections are expressed in good faith and we believe there is reasonable basis for them. However, there can be no assurance that management\u2019s expectations, beliefs and projections will result or be achieved. Investors should not rely on forward-looking statements because they are subject to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these -- from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in our earnings press release, our Form 10-Qs, Form 10-K and other SEC filings. And with that, I will turn it over to Steve.\nSteve Cooper: Thanks, Kareem. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. We are happy to usher the New Year and we are excited about all that 2021 has to offer. With a broad vaccine rollout on the horizon, we are hopeful that the world can safely begin to reopen and that will start to see some return to normalcy. In the meantime, we are very fortunate that our core streaming business remains as strong as ever and that music has a rapidly growing presence in new and diverse applications. In fact, Q1 was the highest revenue quarter in our 17-year history as a standalone company. Our revenue grew 4% year-over-year from our previous record high in Q1 of 2020, an achievement that we are especially proud of given that we accomplished this during the pandemic. The strong double-digit revenue growth in digital more than offset the continued disruption in Recorded Music\u2019s artist services and expanded rights revenue and Music Publishing\u2019s performance revenue. Excluding revenue from those areas, our year-over-year revenue growth in Q1 would be approximately 8%. Adjusted EBITDA was up by approximately 20% year-over-year with margins improving to over 22%. Even with the decline in lower margin revenue streams such as artist services, this growth highlights the operating leverage driven by digital\u2019s increasing contribution to our overall revenue as well as our focus on operating cost management. Our Recorded Music revenue returned to year-over-year growth and was up approximately 5%. Double-digit growth in digital revenue more than offset declines in physical and artist services. Our primary goal will always be to create and deliver a constant, ever-growing flow of dynamic and diverse new music. Our success was on full display when the Grammy nominations were announced in late November. Artists from every one of our U.S. label groups were recognized, as well as talent from the U.K., Nigeria, Jamaica, and Germany. We had two of the most nominated artists of the year with previous Grammy winners, Dua Lipa and Roddy Rich, each getting six nods. We also did very, very well in the big four categories with two nominations in each, Coldplay and Dua in Album of the Year; Roddy and Dua in Record of the Year and Song of the Year; and Chika and triple-nominee, Ingrid Andress, in Best New Artist. 2020 was a landmark year for our labels, with Atlantic taking the number one spot for the fourth consecutive year in on-demand audio streams in the U.S. as reported by Nielsen. Looking ahead, we expect this winning streak to continue with some amazing music from both our emerging talent and global superstars. In Music Publishing, revenue was essentially flat in the quarter, with digital revenue growing almost 36% year over year. This impressive jump was offset by the dislocation and performance where revenue was lost from the ongoing closure of bars, restaurants, clubs, and concerts. Mechanical was down given the continued contraction in physical sales. Sync was also down, but we expect an upward trajectory as COVID subsides and television and film production resume. Warner Chappell continued its creative revitalization in Q1 as its writers contribute -- contributed to 10 No. 1 charting singles in the U.S., including hits from Pop Smoke and Ava Max. Warner Chappell Nashville continued its impressive run being named Country Music Publisher of the Year by ASCAP for the eighth consecutive year and by BMI for the third consecutive year while winning Song of the Year from both. And on the international front, Warner Chappell topped charts across the globe with releases from MNEK, Master KG and Nomcebo, Rauw Alejandro and Jhay Cortez to name a few. There has been a lot of coverage about new players doing big money deals for Music Publishing assets. This is powerful recognition of the value of music, and we are willing and able to do those deals when we believe they make sense. However, given our rigorous financial discipline, we never buy market share at a loss. Instead, we are in the business of developing songwriters\u2019 global careers and catalogs. We build value over the long term through our extensive expertise in global infrastructure. With this in mind, Warner Chappell is unique among the majors for having established a dedicated creative services team that mines our catalog for incremental revenue. As one example announced just last week, our creative services team helped launch the 50th anniversary celebration of the Sound of Philadelphia. This launch includes a partnership with smart speaker manufacturer, Sonos, for a new radio program, which we are honored to have hosted by a long time Warner Chappell icon, Kenny Gamble. We also have a suite of proprietary tools that helps us create new licensing opportunities all around the world for our deep catalog and hidden gems. These tools include our song demo database Ero, and our beat broker service offering easy-to-clear curated songs for sampling. As we have said before, we have a one-company philosophy and Warner Chappell and Recorded Music work closely together to maximize the value of all rights. Our sound recordings and our musical compositions are critical to any comprehensive music service offering, and Warner Chappell\u2019s fractional or full ownership of well over 1 million songs gives us an expanded reach in all of our digital negotiations. As we look ahead, our revenue opportunities are vast and diverse. We continue to see robust growth in both subscription and ad-supported streaming with plenty of runway around the globe. At the same time, the pandemic has accelerated consumer adoption in areas like in-home digital fitness, video gaming, live streaming, and social media. These platforms rely heavily on music, and we are at the forefront of helping them invent and evolve new commercial opportunities. Here are just a few examples from this quarter. With the rapidly growing gaming market, two clear trends have emerged, games as virtual shared social spaces and a shift towards user-generated content. Our recently announced stake in Roblox aligns WMG with a leading platform at the intersection of both of these trends. Roblox is a metaverse of social experiences with an in-game currency, Robux and 40 million daily active users, each on average spending more than 2.5 hours per day on the platform. That level of engagement is unmatched by social networks. As the only music company to have invested in Roblox\u2019s last round, we are in a pull position to create next-generation, music-based fan experiences and products. We have a number of upcoming events that we are excited to announce in the near future. Second, our ever-expanding relationship with TikTok, since being launched outside of China a little over three years ago, this social media app has reportedly attracted more than 1 billion monthly users. TikTok\u2019s creator community now has broad access to the latest hits and classic tracks from our artists and songwriters. Our deal with TikTok will also see us collaborating on imaginative marketing campaigns and offering new ways for fans to express their creativity. There is exciting competition in this space with other companies like Instagram, YouTube, Snap and Tencent also exploring how to read more music into everyone\u2019s social media feeds. Third, we revealed last week that we will be a launch partner for Adaptr. This is a first of its kind service that enables developers to quickly and easily license music. Adaptr is designed to accelerate innovation, reduce infringement and generate incremental value for our artists and songwriters. With so many startups experimenting with music, Adaptr allows them to go straight to market and forge a whole new frontier of commercial possibilities. Fourth, we are differentiating WMG in the marketplace through our collection of owned and operated direct-to-consumer destinations. This global network brings us closer to millions of music fans, while helping us better understand their behavior and emerging cultural trends. Our consumer brands, EMP and UPROXX, as well as our social content publisher, IMGN, all showed double-digit revenue growth in Q1. As our business continues to be pressure tested by COVID, these destinations have been a stabilizing force adding to this quarter\u2019s strong results. The biggest contributor was EMP, our European merchandising e-tailer. With many brick-and-mortar operations remaining under COVID restrictions, EMP seized the opportunity and drove its first quarter revenue up by over 30%, a clever marketing plan generated healthy sales from Black Friday through Cyber Monday, with average order values over those four days increasing by 36% year-over-year. We recently brought in Maria Weaver as President of our Global Artists and Label Services Network, WEA, to oversee all of our D2C efforts. Previously, Chief Marketing Officer for Comcast Advertising, she brings a wealth of new ideas and expertise to help monetize our ever-widening range of music products and experiences. As COVID continues to test our result, we have adapted and become even more resourceful in finding ways to enhance our company\u2019s results. Under difficult circumstances, we have achieved record breaking results, all the while maintaining our track record of financial discipline. We have some fantastic new music from amazing artist and songwriters on the way, and we continue to grow our investment in a new generation of talent, while inventing bold and memorable ways to impact global culture. And with that, I will turn it over to Eric.\nEric Levin: Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We are extremely pleased with our financial performance in the first quarter. Fiscal Q1 of last year was a record breaking revenue quarter for our company and was also the last reporting period that was unaffected by COVID. Against that difficult comparison and while still navigating the challenges presented by the pandemic, we are -- we not only returned the company to growth but we have also set a new all-time high quarterly revenue in our history as a standalone company. Our business model has proved to be robust and flexible, underpinned by continued strong growth in digital and our D2C businesses, as well as our financial discipline. And while COVID continues to challenge some of our -- some areas of our business, we have leaned aggressively into other opportunities whose growth prospects were accelerated by the pandemic. We expect this will position us favorably as things return to normal. Moving to our performance in the quarter, our total revenue was up approximately 4% on a constant currency basis and up 6% on an as-reported basis, compared to the previous quarter. Artist services and Recorded Music and performance in Music Publishing were the areas most affected by COVID due to the cancellation or postponement of tour. If you exclude those areas, our revenue grew 8% on a constant currency basis and 10% on an as-reported basis compared to the prior year quarter. Both adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EBITDA saw significant year-over-year increases in the quarter, reflecting the continuing revenue mix shift from physical to digital. Adjusted OIBDA increased approximately 18% to $282 million with margin improving from 19% to over 21%. This improvement was driven by an increase in contribution from higher margin streaming revenue, cost management initiatives and the impact from certain previously announced transactions that closed in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA increased 19% to $297 million with margin improving from 20% to over 22%. This increase was largely due to the same factors that drove our adjusted OIBDA performance, in addition to higher pro forma savings that we expect to realize from our transformation initiatives and the pro forma impact of those previously announced transactions. Those transactions contributed $5 million to adjusted OIBDA and $9 million to adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. Adjusting the impact of that contribution or excluding the impact of that contribution, our adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EBITDA grew 13% and 16%, respectively. Adjusted OIBDA excludes one-time costs related to restructuring and other transmission initiatives, COVID-related expenses and non-cash stock-based compensation expense in both the current and prior year quarters. Adjusted EBITDA excludes these items and includes pro forma savings that we expect to realize from our transformation initiatives and the pro forma impact of those previously announced transactions. Please refer to our press release for calculations and reconciliations. In Recorded Music, Q1 revenue increased approximately 5% over prior year quarter. Digital revenue grew 13% driven by a 16% increase in streaming revenue. Streaming as a category saw a growth across all key components with both subscription and ad-supported streaming growing double digits and growth in revenue from emerging streaming platforms far outpacing the broader category. Physical revenue declined 9% as the effects of the continued transition to streaming and COVID were partially offset by strong physical releases in the quarter. Licensing revenue declined 1%, driven by lowered deal activity and advertising television and film related to COVID offset by certain one-time settlements. Artist service revenue -- services revenue, which includes tour-related merchandising, as well as our direct-to-consumer merchandising through EMP declined 9%, while revenue related to concert promotion and tour related merchandising declined significantly year-over-year. EMP saw a healthy growth of over 30%, driven by a strong holiday season as COVID restrictions limited brick-and-mortar shopping in Europe. For Q1, Recorded Music adjusted OIBDA increased 16% over the prior year quarter to $275 million due to a revenue mix shift towards digital and overall cost savings. Adjusted OIBDA margin increased 2 percentage points to 24%. Music Publishing revenue declined 1% in Q1 as digital revenue growth up 36%, driven by an increase in streaming revenue and was offset by declines in performance and sync, as well as a decrease in mechanical revenue. Music Publishing adjusted OIBDA increased 18% from $34 million to $40 million, with margins improving from 20% to almost 23% due to revenue mix. In the first quarter, operating cash flow increased to $169 million, compared to $78 million in the prior-year quarter, due to strong operating performance and timing of working capital, including payments from certain digital services. Free cash flow decreased from $46 million in the prior year quarter to negative $174 million. This decline was driven by increased investment activity related to those previously announced transactions, partially offset by an increase in operating cash flow. CapEx in the first quarter was $18 million, compared to $15 million in the prior-year quarter. The increase is related to our previously announced plans to upgrade our IT and finance infrastructure. The total investment associated with this program is expected to be about $20 million in fiscal \u201821, with annualized run rate savings of approximately $35 million to $40 million once fully implemented. For fiscal 2021, we expect total CapEx to be in the range of $90 million to $100 million. Cash taxes were $17 million in the quarter. On December 1st, we paid our regular quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share for an aggregate dividend of $62 million for the quarter. As of December 31, we have a cash balance of $566 million and net debt of approximately $2.8 billion. On November 2nd, we completed a $250-million tag-on to our three 3% Senior Secured Notes due 2031. The proceeds of this financing in conjunction with cash on hand of approximately $90 million were used to fund those previously announced transactions for aggregate cash consideration of $338 million. Additionally, on January 20th, we completed an amendment to our term loan credit agreement. The amendment extends the maturity from November 1, 2023 to January 20, 2028 and removes a number of negative covenants. In closing, we are encouraged by our first quarter performance, which gives us a strong start to the year. Although, challenges related to COVID remain, our solidly in line streaming growth, combined with our outperformance at our D2C business and strong physical releases in the quarter have only increased our conviction in our ability to achieve strong growth in fiscal \u201821. We thank you for joining our call today and we will now open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Morris with Guggenheim. Your line is open.\nMichael Morris: Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. A couple of questions for me, the first one is on streaming and those streaming revenue sources that were strong in the quarter. Eric, I am hoping to maybe push you a little bit on some more detail of the contribution from the new partnerships and the relative performance of the subscription side versus the ad side, it sounds like all were strong. But any additional detail you could give us on maybe relative performance and also how those are pacing in the fiscal second quarter? And my second question, there are a couple of things specifically that you have cited as benefiting during COVID. You have had your virtual concerts, Steve, you spent some time talking about EMP. My question is, as we look forward and hopefully see things starting to open up, do you expect some regression in those areas or do you think you can continue to have a strong base and see perhaps a live event recovery? Thanks, guys.\nEric Levin: Okay. Great. So let me tackle your first one. So as we break streaming into kind of a three broad categories of subscription, ad-supported and emerging forms of digital revenue., subscription and ad-supported are, I would say now both in line, both growing similar amounts in double digits and that is great. Subscription has been growing from COVID double digits throughout the whole time but advertising initially took a dip and then has quarter-by-quarter been showing progress, and this is the first quarter that we can say it\u2019s been double digits. So it feels like the ad-supported streaming has really recovered and its growth is really in line with where we would expect it to be. On the emerging forms of streaming, they continue as they have in the past to grow at a significantly faster rate than both subscription and ad-supported. And that\u2019s both because the category and social and gaming and fitness, live streaming are all really coming online and growing at an accelerated rate, but also because there\u2019s new platforms that emerge that we continue to do deals with, so we have a broader array of partners that we continue to add there. We see no reason why these trends across all three of these categories won\u2019t continue going forward as we continue to see strong performance on those categories plus we also have a high degree of confidence in our strong release schedule going forward. As far as the categories, we would expect to see them going forward even as we come from COVID, especially I think you -- Michael, you were referring to the emerging. Look we see this as a growth area even after we come out of COVID. We think that consumer behavior around social, gaming, the real explosion of metaverses, our growth there is going forward, and we see these areas that we continue to see innovation in, new platforms coming online and continued strong growth going forward, both during a COVID-affected era and thereafter.\nMichael Morris: Thank you for that. And just to clarify on that second part, on EMP, that physical direct-to-consumer in particular as well. You feel that this is a base that\u2019s growing and will be strong, sort of even post the reopening or do you think there is perhaps a little bit of a trade-off there with perhaps live events, merchandising or anything like that?\nEric Levin: I think it\u2019s -- thank you. That\u2019s a great question. EMP is a business that when we acquired about three years ago that we had real belief in their ability to grow their business long term. Nothing we have seen has caused us anything, but to have increased confidence in the business and the management team running EMP. It\u2019s certainly true that the closure of brick-and-mortar businesses has driven consumers more to ecommerce platforms, and EMP has both been a benefit of that, but EMP has also not been passive. They have broadened their product line, they have innovated their marketing tactics, and continued to sharpen their skills in reaching their customers, but also expanding their customer base across Europe. So, although 30% growth may not be the norm in the future, we see growth and solid growth in that platform as something that we will be managing towards both during the COVID-affected era and thereafter.\nMichael Morris: Okay. Thank you.\nEric Levin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alexia Quadrani with JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you very much. Can you talk about the impact from acquisitions you highlighted on your last call, I believe it was $338 million, and how did that impact your results this quarter and what do you expect the impact to be going forward? And then my sort of follow-up question is sort of a follow-up on your commentary and your answer to Michael\u2019s question. I think he asked about the emerging growth platforms for gaming and fitness and stuff and how you will do there when the economies reopen. I guess my follow-up on that is a little bit different in the sense is, if we do see a pullback in gaming and we do see a pullback in fitness in terms of engagement, is your penetration level so early days that regardless of maybe a pullback in engagement in the broader population, you still can see kind of robust growth on those platforms because you have so much more to kind of grow within the existing platform?\nEric Levin: So, on the M&A one, the M&A that we are talking about that we acquired for $338 million. In Q1, it had a $5 million incremental OIBDA impact and a $9 million incremental impact to adjusted EBITDA. Note, as we look at it on an annualized basis -- and those numbers are in line with our expectations, that the kind of run rate OIBDA on an annualized basis was about $37 million and you can see how that\u2019s kind of consistent with these numbers and these businesses performed right in line with expectations. As far as emerging platforms, what I would say is we see music becoming more and more integrated across social gaming, metaverses, the various places where live streaming is integrated, and we see it as being very early days and we see the ubiquity of music across so many different forms, both existing and new, really kind of just finding a stride that we would be -- we fully expect to be managing that line for growth both during COVID and thereafter.\nAlexia Quadrani: Thank you.\nEric Levin: Thanks, Alexia.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nBen Swinburne: Thanks. Good afternoon. I want to hear from Steve on the strategy for these emerging digital platforms and what I mean by that is the press reported you guys signed, I think, a second TikTok deal in a relatively short period of time, I think, the first one was in April and then this most recent one just in January and I know you can\u2019t talk about specifics. But as these agreements evolve and you renew them, what other than trying to maximize your revenues are you trying to accomplish? How do these agreements and the business models behind them in your eyes evolve over time? Do they eventually look and feel like kind of streaming, so it\u2019s a rev share and relatively predictable or do you think these are going to be quite different? And also specific to TikTok, hopefully, you can comment, they reported that there were 70 artists -- over 70 artists that broke on TikTok and were signed by majors last year. I am just wondering how you guys are ensuring that you are able to find and sign the artists you want ahead of your competition? I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on those things.\nSteve Cooper: Thanks, Ben. So let me start first with kind of how we see the shape of the world. Our revenue falls into, what I would call, four buckets. First is, I am going to put aside for the moment physical and touring related revenue and talk about really digital. So, in the four buckets, we have got the traditional streaming. And we see, as Eric has said, a lot of runway both with the established services in the more mature markets, as well as emerging markets. The second bucket are really the social platforms and, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, they are using more and more music, not because they are pushing it, but because their users are pulling it. And so, with respect to the social platforms, we continue to shape and/or reshape our deals based upon how mature they are relative to their growth curve and what support we believe they need from us to blossom into very substantial sources of revenue. And I think as we mentioned to people during our IPO, the average startups we typically give breaks in exchange for futures and so far that approach has worked very well for us. The third bucket are, what I would call, these interactive business models. You have got Fortnite, you have got Roblox, you have got in certain respects some of the fitness models. And we see ourselves as being part of those universes or metaverses, where we establish ourselves and our business as an integral part of those universes. Roblox, in particular, has a very interesting model where you can create your own business, your own world, in our case, our own music entertainment world inside of their metaverse. And our intent is to continue to work within these interactive digital worlds to create a strong presence for the Warner Music Group, where we are able, whether it be on a transaction or a sharing basis, able to work with them not only to optimize our revenue but help them build their models. The fourth bucket is frankly all other and those are new models and new opportunities that are literally emerging day-in and day-out. And I can\u2019t tell you yet, exactly how we are going to handle them, but we do know is that we see a constant stream of opportunities to both partner risk and to invest in for the foreseeable future and we plan on continuing to do that. With TikTok, specifically, we have a very close relationship. One of our recent acquisitions, IMGN, was recently named as one of their top-five creators and we have very good relationships with the collective known as influencers on TikTok and with people that utilize our music. In fact, you may have seen, I don\u2019t know, a month or two ago, that Dreams, it\u2019s a 40-year-old song and it was used on TikTok and came back into the top-10 on radio and the top-10 on streaming services. So we work through our labels and through our affiliates, our local affiliates around the globe to ensure that we have a strong relationship not only with the service itself, but the creators and developers on those services that wish to utilize our music and we wish to utilize their talent. So, hopefully, that answers your question.\nBen Swinburne: Yeah. Thanks. Even I heard of the Dreams thing on TikTok. That\u2019s how big it was. Thank you for the color.\nSteve Cooper: Yeah. Yeah.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nHeath Terry: Great. Thank you very much. Steve, I am wondering how you are -- as we hopefully kind of come closer to the light at the end of the tunnel here. I am wondering how you are planning for Warner\u2019s position in live music. Is there work that can be done now, is being done now around preparing for the return of live events sort of positioning your artists as best as possible, as we are kind of thinking about what the second half of 2021 could look like? How do you see this opportunity kind of playing out for Warner to get a faster start?\nSteve Cooper: Well, I actually see several things. First of all, I hope that the second half of calendar 2021, I hope that the vaccine is being broadly distributed. I hope that we get clarification on its efficacy rates relative to the new strains and that businesses can open and we can begin the, what I think is going to be a longer path to get back to some semblance of normalcy. So what we are doing in the interim is a couple things. Number one, we are taking advantage of live streaming to continue to promote our established and our emerging artists and we are doing that with any number of digital streaming partners that are operating successfully in the live streaming world and in the virtual reality worlds. So what we are continuing to do is work in a variety of ways to grow the fan bases for established and emerging artists. We obviously continue to roll forward plans for our live activities, our promotional touring. But as you know, for our emerging talent, much of that relies on the opening of smaller venues and while we are hopeful that that\u2019s going to happen sooner as opposed to later, we also know that the way we schedule this and the way we return to live has to be carefully crafted so that our artists don\u2019t get lost in a traffic jam. But our label operators are looking at this on a regular, regular basis, because they know that when the gates do open, we have to be in the right lane so to speak. What we also believe and I think that Eric touched on this as well is peoples habits are changing and we are looking to, frankly, capitalize on that by establishing a sound foundation in live streaming and working on establishing live foundations in these interactive worlds, Heath. So we are aware of it. We continue to roll-forward our plans. But we are looking at other ways in which, frankly, to capitalize on what\u2019s been a -- for the planet, broadly speaking, a horrendous situation.\nHeath Terry: Great. Thanks. Thank you, Steve. I appreciate that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Bazinet with Citi. Your line is open.\nJason Bazinet: Hi. This is maybe a dumb question but I am going to ask it anyway. When you guys talked about EMP, I sort of thought about it as a bit of a side show and with this IMGN media asset that you bought and your stake in, I think, you have a stake in Roblox. I am starting to think we sort of are seeing the early outlines of a strategy to almost vertically integrate in a new way, not by buying a traditional streamer or anything like that. But is that the right way to think about how you are thinking about using your excess cash flow?\nSteve Cooper: Well, I think that you should look at it in a couple ways, Jason. I got the name right, I hope it. I am\u2026\nJason Bazinet: Yeah.\nSteve Cooper: I am doing this on an iPhone, so sometimes it\u2019s a little scratchy. We are doing, I guess, you could look at our strategies, our growth strategies in a couple ways. The first is, we are going to ensure that our core businesses, Recorded Music and Music Publishing, that we continue to build thoughtfully with the right financial discipline those businesses. So we intend on over time continuing to increase our A&R budgets and the related budgets of marketing and promotion. We also plan on enhancing the footprint of those businesses on the Music Publishing side, primarily through catalog acquisitions, on the Recorded Music side, primarily through the acquisition of going concerns or opening new offices. But what streaming has shown us is that it is more important than ever in our core businesses to be global and not Anglo-centric and that\u2019s been one of our goals over the last eight years or nine years and we are going to continue to pursue that.\nJason Bazinet: Yeah.\nSteve Cooper: So that\u2019s number one. Number two, some of the moves that we have made have to do with not only revenue diversification, where we see the world of musical entertainment in the next five years or 10 years, Jason.\nJason Bazinet: Yeah.\nSteve Cooper: And where we see the intersection of social, of gaming, of God knows, everything else are in these metaverses, where people come to them for any number of reasons and we want to make music a far more compelling reason to come to these alternative worlds.\nJason Bazinet: Yeah.\nSteve Cooper: So that is where we see much of the future and we intend on investing in a future that we believe is figuratively and almost literally around the corner. So your observation is accurate.\nJason Bazinet: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Russo with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nBrian Russo: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. This is a follow-up to a couple of the earlier questions either for Steve or Eric. When you look at the impact the shutdown had on the subscription streaming in calendar \u201820. It didn\u2019t look like the subscription piece was really negatively impacted. When the world sort of returns to concerts and live events, hopefully, later this year, do you think we should expect to see the subscription streaming benefit at all, maybe with the notion that you have a lot more new music coming and new concerts might encourage consumers to subscribe? Thank you.\nEric Levin: Well, I am happy to help answer that. So the return post-COVID for subscription streaming, we think the environment is growing solidly now. There are opportunities for that to grow potentially. We could break it into developed markets and emerging markets. In developed markets, we continue to see subscriber growth. We think we are still relatively early innings and there\u2019s ample room for subscriber growth. What we are starting to see with the DSP is there\u2019s some experimentation with price increases and we think as that we hope and think there\u2019s a strong opportunity for that to gain traction. So whether it\u2019s Spotify, which has in selected markets increased the price of family plan, or Amazon and we hope other platforms looking at high resolution as a tier that can support increased pricing. So we think that has the potential to be a positive impact on developed markets as their ARPU has the opportunity which really hasn\u2019t increased in the past 10 years to go up. And we think emerging markets are really just starting to find their stride. It is really very, very early days and we think that the growth there has the potential to really accelerate brands that they will be lower ARPU. However, those markets in the past were relatively light revenue contributors overall and as subscription streaming and ad streaming find their way into emerging markets, really has an opportunity to be incremental growth at very high rates. So we do think that subscription streaming and ad-supported streaming have an opportunity to really continue to grow strongly going forward using those combination of factors. Hopefully, that answers your question, Brian.\nBrian Russo: Well, Eric, just a follow-up.\nEric Levin: Yeah.\nBrian Russo: I think in a prior call, you were talking about back half weighted this year in terms of your release schedule, lot more artists are releasing and that\u2019s kind of what I was asking about, if you have a sort of like a push for lots of new releases and the artists will support this by touring, fingers crossed. Is that something that sort of moves the needle for the subscription streaming or is it all just sort of more based on the overall number of subscribers and some of the other ARPU opportunities you talked about?\nEric Levin: No. It\u2019s a combination, Brian. I mean, certainly, subscribers and ARPU are a huge part of the equation, but also market share is and market share can be driven through a combination of things. Obviously, new releases and having a strong release schedule is part of the formula continuing to mine our catalog and continuing to make sure that new audiences are discovering our catalog. We are continuing to keep that robust. So, yes, as releases continue to come out, and hopefully, we expect to have a strong release schedule, which we continue to work towards the second half the year, we would obviously expect that and hope that drives streaming opportunities. So, yeah, we do think that is certainly something we are striving for.\nBrian Russo: Terrific. Thank you.\nEric Levin: Thanks, Brian.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rich Greenfield with LightShed. Your line is open.\nRich Greenfield: Hi. Thanks for taking it. I guess two questions. One, you have been -- Steve and the total team, you have been talking so extensively about gaming. I haven\u2019t counted the number of times metaverse has come up but it\u2019s a lot. Like as you think about how much gaming has played into it, where does Twitch fall into this, I know that they have gotten -- you all, as an industry, gotten a lot harder on takedowns and sort of making sure that copyright is respected. Where are they in terms of licensing music from Warner Music, is that a 2021 goal to get something larger done? And then the second, it\u2019s sort of a bigger, broader topic, but we are seeing all of the major subscription streaming platforms and even ad-supported streaming platforms for that matter, get a lot more focused on podcasting. And I have certainly seen podcasters start to integrate more and more premium audio content -- music content into podcasts. Is that where the opportunity lies, is it a risk that podcasts start to eat into music time spent? Like, I guess, just how do you look at the overall podcast equation, I guess, is the multi-layered question as part two?\nSteve Cooper: Well, let me deal with Twitch first. I believe the industry is in deep conversations with Twitch about licensing, because you are right, there has been this kind of aggravated back and forth. I am relatively confident that will be resolved in 2021. And what it does show is the utilization of music in the gaming world is a critical element to gaming. It provides the beat in the game so to speak. So I am confident that that will get resolved and it will get resolved to everybody\u2019s satisfaction. On podcasting, I get torn about podcasting. We do dozens upon dozens upon dozens of podcasts at the operating level and they are aired on Apple. They are aired on radio. They are aired on, I think, we got a deal with Spotify. They are aired on a number of services. But I believe that people come to the streaming services primarily to listen to music and listen to podcasts. So those who come for podcasts will also listen to music and I believe that it will be beneficial in both directions. What I have seen is that podcasts have smaller followings and there are dozens upon dozens upon dozens of niches. And people -- at least the people I know, don\u2019t listen to the same podcast 5 times, 10 times, 15 times, 20 times, 30 times, which they will do with their favorite tracks of music. So the way podcasting, at least again in my view, has to be serviced is with just ongoing, ongoing levels of content to smaller crowds and while we are doing that, providing content to these services and these narrow niches, ultimately, I see them as a gateway, particularly as people use more and more music in podcasts as a gateway to just listening to more music in general on a streaming, Rich.\nRich Greenfield: So you think that ultimately podcasting can actually help be a way to introduce music to different audiences than just traditionally just listening to music as a starting point?\nSteve Cooper: Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Look, it\u2019s -- if you think about all of the regular broadcast TV programs that used to introduce new music to the world, whether it\u2019s the contests, American Idol or The Voice or Glee, podcasts for some people will be a source of discovery and to the extent they like what they hear, that will lead them to listen to music that they discovered these to be the broad podcast and music that\u2019s similar, because it now gets curated on all of these services. So I think the answer is, yeah, that podcasting will benefit music.\nRich Greenfield: Thanks for the thoughtful answers. I really appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Well, thank you. Thanks. Two, I guess, topics, one is streaming and the other is just artists or talent. On streaming, you kind of touched on this earlier, but Spotify is testing price increases in seven markets and it\u2019s been going on for -- to several months now. Have you seen anything in terms of changes in dynamics given the price changes and is there a way for you to incentive -- if it\u2019s successful, is there a way for you to incentivize other DSPs to follow on, I mean, Amazon has a different offer. And then also within streaming, where do you think you will see meaningful growth going forward in terms of new markets, Spotify just launched in South Korea, Russia was one of their biggest launches and there\u2019s talk of DSPs going into Africa, which is a market I can imagine you guys monetized well in the past? And then kind of switching gears, you mentioned in the press release, as well as on the call a few times, your upcoming release schedule for new -- I think you mean new and established artists. Is there any color that you can give us in terms of visibility of what will be coming? Thank you.\nSteve Cooper: Well, Eric, let me make a couple of comments, and you may want to chime in. So just about streaming broadly and the monetization, Jessica, our view is that there\u2019s still an enormous gap between the monetization of eyeballs and the monetization of ears. And ultimately, we think that all of the streamers, as they add new features, new functionality, by way of example, you cited Amazon with their high res. You are right Spotify is experimenting with price increases. Ultimately, we think that all of the services over time will increase prices. We encourage them to do this and when we think about the tens of millions of tracks that people get for a few dollars a month, our expectations every day grow that the services will begin to raise prices for functionality and features and Spotify is experimenting. We hope they broaden that experiment relative to pricing. As we have said, we think that there\u2019s a lot of runway still, not only in the more mature markets but in emerging markets. And as they launch in new markets, even when they begin with free offerings, it exposes people to more and more music. You mentioned Russia. Well, in Russia, even before the advent of Spotify, there are a number of streamers that we and others have partnered with, and Russia is a nicely growing market. The same is true in South Korea. You mentioned Africa, where we have partnered with Africori, which is one of the largest music streamers and distributors in Africa. So while these markets, by way of economics don\u2019t look overly meaningful at the moment when you compare them to the U.S. or Japan or the U.K., they are growing. People are being exposed to curated music. People are being exposed to some of the world\u2019s greatest artists, both global artists, as well as local artists. And so our view is that while the circumference of the globe is only 25,000 miles with respect to the circumference of music, it\u2019s a lot more. So that was streaming in new markets. What was your third question?\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Sorry, I was on mute. Well, first of all, on Spotify, I mean, have you seen any change in consumer behavior because of the price increases? And then my second question and my last question was, more about your -- talent is such so important for you and you alluded in the press release, as well as in the call you guys have talked about your release schedule. Is there any color that you can give us or visibility for the rest of the year on new or established artists? And then if I could just follow up on something you just said, Steve, very interesting. Well, it\u2019s true that local artists will drive part of the market in addition to the international artists. What is that developing artist, and you said, you want to be more global as time goes on, less Anglo. How about bringing those local artists to the Anglo markets?\nSteve Cooper: Well, all right, so I will do that. And then, Eric, can talk about any change in behavior. So we do that. We cross our artists wherever we can and where we see the potential in both directions. By way of example, one of the most prominent Chinese artists, JJ Lin, in one of his latest albums in China, we featured our artists from the west and vice versa. We look for crossover opportunities whenever we can and we do it because one of the things we have observed. And I think we have mentioned this before, is global hits can come from anywhere and resonate everywhere and we are seeing more and more examples of that every day and we run our Recorded Music business in a way that not only are we global but we are also very local. You will see in the Grammy nominations, Burna Boy, who has put out, I don\u2019t know, I think maybe three or four albums now with Atlantic. He\u2019s the first Nigerian homegrown artist to be nominated for a Grammy and we have successfully worked with him, because he\u2019s such a talented kid, to take him global so to speak. So we do see that, and we do actively work on that. We have taken Anitta from Brazil and blown her up over all of South America, Central America and Mexico, the Iberian Peninsula and other parts of the world. With respect to our schedule, we -- schedule of releases, we typically don\u2019t give a forward look on that. I will just say that when Eric characterized it as a very strong release schedule from both our superstars and our emerging artists, he was spot on. So, Eric, you want to comment on changes\u2026\nEric Levin: Yeah.\nSteve Cooper: \u2026 relative toward or behavioral changes?\nEric Levin: Yeah. Well, yeah, well, I would say, it\u2019s -- I would be cautious in us characterizing how Spotify\u2019s consumers responded to their family plan rate increases. There are some things that we can say. One is, we think this is a natural progression that there would be experimentation and getting data on how customers respond and then using that data to determine if, when and how to continue a progression of rate increases. I think there\u2019s been some reports today that Spotify has raised the family plan prices in both Canada and France, additional markets. We think that\u2019s very encouraging and indicative of a continued momentum of growing family plan increases to additional markets. So we think there is momentum that is starting to pick up on price increases and we would continue to -- you also asked that how we are incentivizing. Look, we think are our deals incentivize both sides to be supportive of rate increases, they are purely accretive. We are in constant discussions with the DSPs not just when we are having negotiations and talking about what we see and what they see as opportunities, and obviously, price increase would be one vector we are having conversations and we are seeing some positive movement across DSPs in that direction. And we do think as some of the influential, larger DSPs start to have positive feedback on their rate increases that certainly will encourage others to follow suit. And we don\u2019t control that happening. But we certainly are encouraging of it and we are seeing early signs of what we think could be that movement directionally. Thank you.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Great. Thank you both.\nEric Levin: Thanks, Jessica.\nOperator: Thank you. I\u2019d now like to turn the call back over to Steve Cooper for closing remarks.\nSteve Cooper: Well, I want to thank everybody again for taking the time to join us today and I just hope you all stay safe and stay sane. So thanks again and we will talk to you in a few months. Bye now.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Eric Levin",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve, and good afternoon, everyone. We are extremely pleased with our financial performance in the first quarter. Fiscal Q1 of last year was a record breaking revenue quarter for our company and was also the last reporting period that was unaffected by COVID. Against that difficult comparison and while still navigating the challenges presented by the pandemic, we are -- we not only returned the company to growth but we have also set a new all-time high quarterly revenue in our history as a standalone company. Our business model has proved to be robust and flexible, underpinned by continued strong growth in digital and our D2C businesses, as well as our financial discipline. And while COVID continues to challenge some of our -- some areas of our business, we have leaned aggressively into other opportunities whose growth prospects were accelerated by the pandemic. We expect this will position us favorably as things return to normal. Moving to our performance in the quarter, our total revenue was up approximately 4% on a constant currency basis and up 6% on an as-reported basis, compared to the previous quarter. Artist services and Recorded Music and performance in Music Publishing were the areas most affected by COVID due to the cancellation or postponement of tour. If you exclude those areas, our revenue grew 8% on a constant currency basis and 10% on an as-reported basis compared to the prior year quarter. Both adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EBITDA saw significant year-over-year increases in the quarter, reflecting the continuing revenue mix shift from physical to digital. Adjusted OIBDA increased approximately 18% to $282 million with margin improving from 19% to over 21%. This improvement was driven by an increase in contribution from higher margin streaming revenue, cost management initiatives and the impact from certain previously announced transactions that closed in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA increased 19% to $297 million with margin improving from 20% to over 22%. This increase was largely due to the same factors that drove our adjusted OIBDA performance, in addition to higher pro forma savings that we expect to realize from our transformation initiatives and the pro forma impact of those previously announced transactions. Those transactions contributed $5 million to adjusted OIBDA and $9 million to adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. Adjusting the impact of that contribution or excluding the impact of that contribution, our adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EBITDA grew 13% and 16%, respectively. Adjusted OIBDA excludes one-time costs related to restructuring and other transmission initiatives, COVID-related expenses and non-cash stock-based compensation expense in both the current and prior year quarters. Adjusted EBITDA excludes these items and includes pro forma savings that we expect to realize from our transformation initiatives and the pro forma impact of those previously announced transactions. Please refer to our press release for calculations and reconciliations. In Recorded Music, Q1 revenue increased approximately 5% over prior year quarter. Digital revenue grew 13% driven by a 16% increase in streaming revenue. Streaming as a category saw a growth across all key components with both subscription and ad-supported streaming growing double digits and growth in revenue from emerging streaming platforms far outpacing the broader category. Physical revenue declined 9% as the effects of the continued transition to streaming and COVID were partially offset by strong physical releases in the quarter. Licensing revenue declined 1%, driven by lowered deal activity and advertising television and film related to COVID offset by certain one-time settlements. Artist service revenue -- services revenue, which includes tour-related merchandising, as well as our direct-to-consumer merchandising through EMP declined 9%, while revenue related to concert promotion and tour related merchandising declined significantly year-over-year. EMP saw a healthy growth of over 30%, driven by a strong holiday season as COVID restrictions limited brick-and-mortar shopping in Europe. For Q1, Recorded Music adjusted OIBDA increased 16% over the prior year quarter to $275 million due to a revenue mix shift towards digital and overall cost savings. Adjusted OIBDA margin increased 2 percentage points to 24%. Music Publishing revenue declined 1% in Q1 as digital revenue growth up 36%, driven by an increase in streaming revenue and was offset by declines in performance and sync, as well as a decrease in mechanical revenue. Music Publishing adjusted OIBDA increased 18% from $34 million to $40 million, with margins improving from 20% to almost 23% due to revenue mix. In the first quarter, operating cash flow increased to $169 million, compared to $78 million in the prior-year quarter, due to strong operating performance and timing of working capital, including payments from certain digital services. Free cash flow decreased from $46 million in the prior year quarter to negative $174 million. This decline was driven by increased investment activity related to those previously announced transactions, partially offset by an increase in operating cash flow. CapEx in the first quarter was $18 million, compared to $15 million in the prior-year quarter. The increase is related to our previously announced plans to upgrade our IT and finance infrastructure. The total investment associated with this program is expected to be about $20 million in fiscal \u201821, with annualized run rate savings of approximately $35 million to $40 million once fully implemented. For fiscal 2021, we expect total CapEx to be in the range of $90 million to $100 million. Cash taxes were $17 million in the quarter. On December 1st, we paid our regular quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share for an aggregate dividend of $62 million for the quarter. As of December 31, we have a cash balance of $566 million and net debt of approximately $2.8 billion. On November 2nd, we completed a $250-million tag-on to our three 3% Senior Secured Notes due 2031. The proceeds of this financing in conjunction with cash on hand of approximately $90 million were used to fund those previously announced transactions for aggregate cash consideration of $338 million. Additionally, on January 20th, we completed an amendment to our term loan credit agreement. The amendment extends the maturity from November 1, 2023 to January 20, 2028 and removes a number of negative covenants. In closing, we are encouraged by our first quarter performance, which gives us a strong start to the year. Although, challenges related to COVID remain, our solidly in line streaming growth, combined with our outperformance at our D2C business and strong physical releases in the quarter have only increased our conviction in our ability to achieve strong growth in fiscal \u201821. We thank you for joining our call today and we will now open the call for questions. Okay. Great. So let me tackle your first one. So as we break streaming into kind of a three broad categories of subscription, ad-supported and emerging forms of digital revenue., subscription and ad-supported are, I would say now both in line, both growing similar amounts in double digits and that is great. Subscription has been growing from COVID double digits throughout the whole time but advertising initially took a dip and then has quarter-by-quarter been showing progress, and this is the first quarter that we can say it's been double digits. So it feels like the ad-supported streaming has really recovered and its growth is really in line with where we would expect it to be. On the emerging forms of streaming, they continue as they have in the past to grow at a significantly faster rate than both subscription and ad-supported. And that's both because the category and social and gaming and fitness, live streaming are all really coming online and growing at an accelerated rate, but also because there's new platforms that emerge that we continue to do deals with, so we have a broader array of partners that we continue to add there. We see no reason why these trends across all three of these categories won't continue going forward as we continue to see strong performance on those categories plus we also have a high degree of confidence in our strong release schedule going forward. As far as the categories, we would expect to see them going forward even as we come from COVID, especially I think you -- Michael, you were referring to the emerging. Look we see this as a growth area even after we come out of COVID. We think that consumer behavior around social, gaming, the real explosion of metaverses, our growth there is going forward, and we see these areas that we continue to see innovation in, new platforms coming online and continued strong growth going forward, both during a COVID-affected era and thereafter. I think it's -- thank you. That's a great question. EMP is a business that when we acquired about three years ago that we had real belief in their ability to grow their business long term. Nothing we have seen has caused us anything, but to have increased confidence in the business and the management team running EMP. It's certainly true that the closure of brick-and-mortar businesses has driven consumers more to ecommerce platforms, and EMP has both been a benefit of that, but EMP has also not been passive. They have broadened their product line, they have innovated their marketing tactics, and continued to sharpen their skills in reaching their customers, but also expanding their customer base across Europe. So, although 30% growth may not be the norm in the future, we see growth and solid growth in that platform as something that we will be managing towards both during the COVID-affected era and thereafter. Thank you. So, on the M&A one, the M&A that we are talking about that we acquired for $338 million. In Q1, it had a $5 million incremental OIBDA impact and a $9 million incremental impact to adjusted EBITDA. Note, as we look at it on an annualized basis -- and those numbers are in line with our expectations, that the kind of run rate OIBDA on an annualized basis was about $37 million and you can see how that's kind of consistent with these numbers and these businesses performed right in line with expectations. As far as emerging platforms, what I would say is we see music becoming more and more integrated across social gaming, metaverses, the various places where live streaming is integrated, and we see it as being very early days and we see the ubiquity of music across so many different forms, both existing and new, really kind of just finding a stride that we would be -- we fully expect to be managing that line for growth both during COVID and thereafter. Thanks, Alexia. Well, I am happy to help answer that. So the return post-COVID for subscription streaming, we think the environment is growing solidly now. There are opportunities for that to grow potentially. We could break it into developed markets and emerging markets. In developed markets, we continue to see subscriber growth. We think we are still relatively early innings and there's ample room for subscriber growth. What we are starting to see with the DSP is there's some experimentation with price increases and we think as that we hope and think there's a strong opportunity for that to gain traction. So whether it's Spotify, which has in selected markets increased the price of family plan, or Amazon and we hope other platforms looking at high resolution as a tier that can support increased pricing. So we think that has the potential to be a positive impact on developed markets as their ARPU has the opportunity which really hasn't increased in the past 10 years to go up. And we think emerging markets are really just starting to find their stride. It is really very, very early days and we think that the growth there has the potential to really accelerate brands that they will be lower ARPU. However, those markets in the past were relatively light revenue contributors overall and as subscription streaming and ad streaming find their way into emerging markets, really has an opportunity to be incremental growth at very high rates. So we do think that subscription streaming and ad-supported streaming have an opportunity to really continue to grow strongly going forward using those combination of factors. Hopefully, that answers your question, Brian. Yeah. No. It's a combination, Brian. I mean, certainly, subscribers and ARPU are a huge part of the equation, but also market share is and market share can be driven through a combination of things. Obviously, new releases and having a strong release schedule is part of the formula continuing to mine our catalog and continuing to make sure that new audiences are discovering our catalog. We are continuing to keep that robust. So, yes, as releases continue to come out, and hopefully, we expect to have a strong release schedule, which we continue to work towards the second half the year, we would obviously expect that and hope that drives streaming opportunities. So, yeah, we do think that is certainly something we are striving for. Thanks, Brian. Yeah. Yeah. Well, yeah, well, I would say, it's -- I would be cautious in us characterizing how Spotify's consumers responded to their family plan rate increases. There are some things that we can say. One is, we think this is a natural progression that there would be experimentation and getting data on how customers respond and then using that data to determine if, when and how to continue a progression of rate increases. I think there's been some reports today that Spotify has raised the family plan prices in both Canada and France, additional markets. We think that's very encouraging and indicative of a continued momentum of growing family plan increases to additional markets. So we think there is momentum that is starting to pick up on price increases and we would continue to -- you also asked that how we are incentivizing. Look, we think are our deals incentivize both sides to be supportive of rate increases, they are purely accretive. We are in constant discussions with the DSPs not just when we are having negotiations and talking about what we see and what they see as opportunities, and obviously, price increase would be one vector we are having conversations and we are seeing some positive movement across DSPs in that direction.

And we don't control that happening. But we certainly are encouraging of it and we are seeing early signs of what we think could be that movement directionally. Thank you. Thanks, Jessica."

            "name": "Steve Cooper",
            "content": "Thanks, Kareem. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. We are happy to usher the New Year and we are excited about all that 2021 has to offer. With a broad vaccine rollout on the horizon, we are hopeful that the world can safely begin to reopen and that will start to see some return to normalcy. In the meantime, we are very fortunate that our core streaming business remains as strong as ever and that music has a rapidly growing presence in new and diverse applications. In fact, Q1 was the highest revenue quarter in our 17-year history as a standalone company. Our revenue grew 4% year-over-year from our previous record high in Q1 of 2020, an achievement that we are especially proud of given that we accomplished this during the pandemic. The strong double-digit revenue growth in digital more than offset the continued disruption in Recorded Music's artist services and expanded rights revenue and Music Publishing's performance revenue. Excluding revenue from those areas, our year-over-year revenue growth in Q1 would be approximately 8%. Adjusted EBITDA was up by approximately 20% year-over-year with margins improving to over 22%. Even with the decline in lower margin revenue streams such as artist services, this growth highlights the operating leverage driven by digital's increasing contribution to our overall revenue as well as our focus on operating cost management. Our Recorded Music revenue returned to year-over-year growth and was up approximately 5%. Double-digit growth in digital revenue more than offset declines in physical and artist services. Our primary goal will always be to create and deliver a constant, ever-growing flow of dynamic and diverse new music. Our success was on full display when the Grammy nominations were announced in late November. Artists from every one of our U.S. label groups were recognized, as well as talent from the U.K., Nigeria, Jamaica, and Germany. We had two of the most nominated artists of the year with previous Grammy winners, Dua Lipa and Roddy Rich, each getting six nods. We also did very, very well in the big four categories with two nominations in each, Coldplay and Dua in Album of the Year; Roddy and Dua in Record of the Year and Song of the Year; and Chika and triple-nominee, Ingrid Andress, in Best New Artist. 2020 was a landmark year for our labels, with Atlantic taking the number one spot for the fourth consecutive year in on-demand audio streams in the U.S. as reported by Nielsen. Looking ahead, we expect this winning streak to continue with some amazing music from both our emerging talent and global superstars. In Music Publishing, revenue was essentially flat in the quarter, with digital revenue growing almost 36% year over year. This impressive jump was offset by the dislocation and performance where revenue was lost from the ongoing closure of bars, restaurants, clubs, and concerts. Mechanical was down given the continued contraction in physical sales. Sync was also down, but we expect an upward trajectory as COVID subsides and television and film production resume. Warner Chappell continued its creative revitalization in Q1 as its writers contribute -- contributed to 10 No. 1 charting singles in the U.S., including hits from Pop Smoke and Ava Max. Warner Chappell Nashville continued its impressive run being named Country Music Publisher of the Year by ASCAP for the eighth consecutive year and by BMI for the third consecutive year while winning Song of the Year from both. And on the international front, Warner Chappell topped charts across the globe with releases from MNEK, Master KG and Nomcebo, Rauw Alejandro and Jhay Cortez to name a few. There has been a lot of coverage about new players doing big money deals for Music Publishing assets. This is powerful recognition of the value of music, and we are willing and able to do those deals when we believe they make sense. However, given our rigorous financial discipline, we never buy market share at a loss. Instead, we are in the business of developing songwriters' global careers and catalogs. We build value over the long term through our extensive expertise in global infrastructure. With this in mind, Warner Chappell is unique among the majors for having established a dedicated creative services team that mines our catalog for incremental revenue. As one example announced just last week, our creative services team helped launch the 50th anniversary celebration of the Sound of Philadelphia. This launch includes a partnership with smart speaker manufacturer, Sonos, for a new radio program, which we are honored to have hosted by a long time Warner Chappell icon, Kenny Gamble. We also have a suite of proprietary tools that helps us create new licensing opportunities all around the world for our deep catalog and hidden gems. These tools include our song demo database Ero, and our beat broker service offering easy-to-clear curated songs for sampling. As we have said before, we have a one-company philosophy and Warner Chappell and Recorded Music work closely together to maximize the value of all rights. Our sound recordings and our musical compositions are critical to any comprehensive music service offering, and Warner Chappell's fractional or full ownership of well over 1 million songs gives us an expanded reach in all of our digital negotiations. As we look ahead, our revenue opportunities are vast and diverse. We continue to see robust growth in both subscription and ad-supported streaming with plenty of runway around the globe. At the same time, the pandemic has accelerated consumer adoption in areas like in-home digital fitness, video gaming, live streaming, and social media. These platforms rely heavily on music, and we are at the forefront of helping them invent and evolve new commercial opportunities. Here are just a few examples from this quarter. With the rapidly growing gaming market, two clear trends have emerged, games as virtual shared social spaces and a shift towards user-generated content. Our recently announced stake in Roblox aligns WMG with a leading platform at the intersection of both of these trends. Roblox is a metaverse of social experiences with an in-game currency, Robux and 40 million daily active users, each on average spending more than 2.5 hours per day on the platform. That level of engagement is unmatched by social networks. As the only music company to have invested in Roblox's last round, we are in a pull position to create next-generation, music-based fan experiences and products. We have a number of upcoming events that we are excited to announce in the near future. Second, our ever-expanding relationship with TikTok, since being launched outside of China a little over three years ago, this social media app has reportedly attracted more than 1 billion monthly users. TikTok's creator community now has broad access to the latest hits and classic tracks from our artists and songwriters. Our deal with TikTok will also see us collaborating on imaginative marketing campaigns and offering new ways for fans to express their creativity. There is exciting competition in this space with other companies like Instagram, YouTube, Snap and Tencent also exploring how to read more music into everyone's social media feeds. Third, we revealed last week that we will be a launch partner for Adaptr. This is a first of its kind service that enables developers to quickly and easily license music. Adaptr is designed to accelerate innovation, reduce infringement and generate incremental value for our artists and songwriters. With so many startups experimenting with music, Adaptr allows them to go straight to market and forge a whole new frontier of commercial possibilities. Fourth, we are differentiating WMG in the marketplace through our collection of owned and operated direct-to-consumer destinations. This global network brings us closer to millions of music fans, while helping us better understand their behavior and emerging cultural trends. Our consumer brands, EMP and UPROXX, as well as our social content publisher, IMGN, all showed double-digit revenue growth in Q1. As our business continues to be pressure tested by COVID, these destinations have been a stabilizing force adding to this quarter's strong results. The biggest contributor was EMP, our European merchandising e-tailer. With many brick-and-mortar operations remaining under COVID restrictions, EMP seized the opportunity and drove its first quarter revenue up by over 30%, a clever marketing plan generated healthy sales from Black Friday through Cyber Monday, with average order values over those four days increasing by 36% year-over-year. We recently brought in Maria Weaver as President of our Global Artists and Label Services Network, WEA, to oversee all of our D2C efforts. Previously, Chief Marketing Officer for Comcast Advertising, she brings a wealth of new ideas and expertise to help monetize our ever-widening range of music products and experiences. As COVID continues to test our result, we have adapted and become even more resourceful in finding ways to enhance our company's results. Under difficult circumstances, we have achieved record breaking results, all the while maintaining our track record of financial discipline. We have some fantastic new music from amazing artist and songwriters on the way, and we continue to grow our investment in a new generation of talent, while inventing bold and memorable ways to impact global culture. And with that, I will turn it over to Eric. Thanks, Ben. So let me start first with kind of how we see the shape of the world. Our revenue falls into, what I would call, four buckets. First is, I am going to put aside for the moment physical and touring related revenue and talk about really digital. So, in the four buckets, we have got the traditional streaming. And we see, as Eric has said, a lot of runway both with the established services in the more mature markets, as well as emerging markets. The second bucket are really the social platforms and, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, they are using more and more music, not because they are pushing it, but because their users are pulling it. And so, with respect to the social platforms, we continue to shape and/or reshape our deals based upon how mature they are relative to their growth curve and what support we believe they need from us to blossom into very substantial sources of revenue. And I think as we mentioned to people during our IPO, the average startups we typically give breaks in exchange for futures and so far that approach has worked very well for us. The third bucket are, what I would call, these interactive business models. You have got Fortnite, you have got Roblox, you have got in certain respects some of the fitness models. And we see ourselves as being part of those universes or metaverses, where we establish ourselves and our business as an integral part of those universes. Roblox, in particular, has a very interesting model where you can create your own business, your own world, in our case, our own music entertainment world inside of their metaverse. And our intent is to continue to work within these interactive digital worlds to create a strong presence for the Warner Music Group, where we are able, whether it be on a transaction or a sharing basis, able to work with them not only to optimize our revenue but help them build their models. The fourth bucket is frankly all other and those are new models and new opportunities that are literally emerging day-in and day-out. And I can't tell you yet, exactly how we are going to handle them, but we do know is that we see a constant stream of opportunities to both partner risk and to invest in for the foreseeable future and we plan on continuing to do that. With TikTok, specifically, we have a very close relationship. One of our recent acquisitions, IMGN, was recently named as one of their top-five creators and we have very good relationships with the collective known as influencers on TikTok and with people that utilize our music. In fact, you may have seen, I don't know, a month or two ago, that Dreams, it's a 40-year-old song and it was used on TikTok and came back into the top-10 on radio and the top-10 on streaming services. So we work through our labels and through our affiliates, our local affiliates around the globe to ensure that we have a strong relationship not only with the service itself, but the creators and developers on those services that wish to utilize our music and we wish to utilize their talent. So, hopefully, that answers your question. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I actually see several things. First of all, I hope that the second half of calendar 2021, I hope that the vaccine is being broadly distributed. I hope that we get clarification on its efficacy rates relative to the new strains and that businesses can open and we can begin the, what I think is going to be a longer path to get back to some semblance of normalcy. So what we are doing in the interim is a couple things. Number one, we are taking advantage of live streaming to continue to promote our established and our emerging artists and we are doing that with any number of digital streaming partners that are operating successfully in the live streaming world and in the virtual reality worlds. So what we are continuing to do is work in a variety of ways to grow the fan bases for established and emerging artists. We obviously continue to roll forward plans for our live activities, our promotional touring. But as you know, for our emerging talent, much of that relies on the opening of smaller venues and while we are hopeful that that's going to happen sooner as opposed to later, we also know that the way we schedule this and the way we return to live has to be carefully crafted so that our artists don't get lost in a traffic jam. But our label operators are looking at this on a regular, regular basis, because they know that when the gates do open, we have to be in the right lane so to speak. What we also believe and I think that Eric touched on this as well is peoples habits are changing and we are looking to, frankly, capitalize on that by establishing a sound foundation in live streaming and working on establishing live foundations in these interactive worlds, Heath. So we are aware of it. We continue to roll-forward our plans. But we are looking at other ways in which, frankly, to capitalize on what's been a -- for the planet, broadly speaking, a horrendous situation. Well, I think that you should look at it in a couple ways, Jason. I got the name right, I hope it. I am... I am doing this on an iPhone, so sometimes it's a little scratchy. We are doing, I guess, you could look at our strategies, our growth strategies in a couple ways. The first is, we are going to ensure that our core businesses, Recorded Music and Music Publishing, that we continue to build thoughtfully with the right financial discipline those businesses. So we intend on over time continuing to increase our A&R budgets and the related budgets of marketing and promotion. We also plan on enhancing the footprint of those businesses on the Music Publishing side, primarily through catalog acquisitions, on the Recorded Music side, primarily through the acquisition of going concerns or opening new offices. But what streaming has shown us is that it is more important than ever in our core businesses to be global and not Anglo-centric and that's been one of our goals over the last eight years or nine years and we are going to continue to pursue that. So that's number one. Number two, some of the moves that we have made have to do with not only revenue diversification, where we see the world of musical entertainment in the next five years or 10 years, Jason. And where we see the intersection of social, of gaming, of God knows, everything else are in these metaverses, where people come to them for any number of reasons and we want to make music a far more compelling reason to come to these alternative worlds. So that is where we see much of the future and we intend on investing in a future that we believe is figuratively and almost literally around the corner. So your observation is accurate. Well, let me deal with Twitch first. I believe the industry is in deep conversations with Twitch about licensing, because you are right, there has been this kind of aggravated back and forth. I am relatively confident that will be resolved in 2021. And what it does show is the utilization of music in the gaming world is a critical element to gaming. It provides the beat in the game so to speak. So I am confident that that will get resolved and it will get resolved to everybody's satisfaction. On podcasting, I get torn about podcasting. We do dozens upon dozens upon dozens of podcasts at the operating level and they are aired on Apple. They are aired on radio. They are aired on, I think, we got a deal with Spotify. They are aired on a number of services. But I believe that people come to the streaming services primarily to listen to music and listen to podcasts. So those who come for podcasts will also listen to music and I believe that it will be beneficial in both directions. What I have seen is that podcasts have smaller followings and there are dozens upon dozens upon dozens of niches. And people -- at least the people I know, don't listen to the same podcast 5 times, 10 times, 15 times, 20 times, 30 times, which they will do with their favorite tracks of music. So the way podcasting, at least again in my view, has to be serviced is with just ongoing, ongoing levels of content to smaller crowds and while we are doing that, providing content to these services and these narrow niches, ultimately, I see them as a gateway, particularly as people use more and more music in podcasts as a gateway to just listening to more music in general on a streaming, Rich. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Look, it's -- if you think about all of the regular broadcast TV programs that used to introduce new music to the world, whether it's the contests, American Idol or The Voice or Glee, podcasts for some people will be a source of discovery and to the extent they like what they hear, that will lead them to listen to music that they discovered these to be the broad podcast and music that's similar, because it now gets curated on all of these services. So I think the answer is, yeah, that podcasting will benefit music. Well, Eric, let me make a couple of comments, and you may want to chime in. So just about streaming broadly and the monetization, Jessica, our view is that there's still an enormous gap between the monetization of eyeballs and the monetization of ears. And ultimately, we think that all of the streamers, as they add new features, new functionality, by way of example, you cited Amazon with their high res. You are right Spotify is experimenting with price increases. Ultimately, we think that all of the services over time will increase prices. We encourage them to do this and when we think about the tens of millions of tracks that people get for a few dollars a month, our expectations every day grow that the services will begin to raise prices for functionality and features and Spotify is experimenting. We hope they broaden that experiment relative to pricing. As we have said, we think that there's a lot of runway still, not only in the more mature markets but in emerging markets. And as they launch in new markets, even when they begin with free offerings, it exposes people to more and more music. You mentioned Russia. Well, in Russia, even before the advent of Spotify, there are a number of streamers that we and others have partnered with, and Russia is a nicely growing market. The same is true in South Korea. You mentioned Africa, where we have partnered with Africori, which is one of the largest music streamers and distributors in Africa. So while these markets, by way of economics don't look overly meaningful at the moment when you compare them to the U.S. or Japan or the U.K., they are growing. People are being exposed to curated music. People are being exposed to some of the world's greatest artists, both global artists, as well as local artists. And so our view is that while the circumference of the globe is only 25,000 miles with respect to the circumference of music, it's a lot more. So that was streaming in new markets. What was your third question? Well, all right, so I will do that. And then, Eric, can talk about any change in behavior. So we do that. We cross our artists wherever we can and where we see the potential in both directions. By way of example, one of the most prominent Chinese artists, JJ Lin, in one of his latest albums in China, we featured our artists from the west and vice versa. We look for crossover opportunities whenever we can and we do it because one of the things we have observed. And I think we have mentioned this before, is global hits can come from anywhere and resonate everywhere and we are seeing more and more examples of that every day and we run our Recorded Music business in a way that not only are we global but we are also very local. You will see in the Grammy nominations, Burna Boy, who has put out, I don't know, I think maybe three or four albums now with Atlantic. He's the first Nigerian homegrown artist to be nominated for a Grammy and we have successfully worked with him, because he's such a talented kid, to take him global so to speak. So we do see that, and we do actively work on that. We have taken Anitta from Brazil and blown her up over all of South America, Central America and Mexico, the Iberian Peninsula and other parts of the world. With respect to our schedule, we -- schedule of releases, we typically don't give a forward look on that. I will just say that when Eric characterized it as a very strong release schedule from both our superstars and our emerging artists, he was spot on. So, Eric, you want to comment on changes... ... relative toward or behavioral changes? Well, I want to thank everybody again for taking the time to join us today and I just hope you all stay safe and stay sane. So thanks again and we will talk to you in a few months. Bye now."

At the request of Warner Music Group, today\u2019s call is being recorded for replay purposes, and if you object, you may disconnect at any time. Now, I would like to turn today\u2019s call over to your host, Mr. Kareem Chin, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nKareem Chin: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Warner Music Group\u2019s fiscal fourth quarter and full year earnings conference call. Please note that our earnings press release, earnings snapshot, and the Form 10-Q we filed this morning will be available on our website. On today\u2019s call, we have our CEO, Steve Cooper; and our CFO, Eric Levin, who will take you through our results, and then we will answer your questions. Before our prepared remarks, I\u2019d like to refer you to the second slide of the earnings snapshot to remind you that this communication includes forward-looking statements that reflect the current views of Warner Music Group about future events and financial performance. We plan to present certain non-GAAP results during this conference call and in our earnings snapshot slides, and have provided schedules reconciling these results to our GAAP results in our earnings press release. All of these materials are posted on our website. Also, please note that all revenue figures and comparisons discussed today will be presented in constant currency, unless otherwise noted. All forward-looking statements are made as of today and we disclaim any duty to update such statements. Our expectations, beliefs, and projections are expressed in good faith, and we believe there is a reasonable basis for them. However, there can be no assurance that management\u2019s expectations, beliefs and projections will result or be achieved. Investors should not rely on forward-looking statements because they are subject to a variety of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in our filings with the SEC. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Steve.\nSteve Cooper: Thanks, Kareem. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As you may know, I'll be stepping down as CEO in January, so this is my last earnings call. I'll have more to say about our leadership transition later, but let's start by talking about what's happening today. It's no secret that we've been challenged on multiple fronts as we navigated the tumultuous macro environment. This includes financial volatility, rising interest rates, inflation, declines in online advertising spend, and currency headwinds. In addition, we've been navigating the complexities created by the pandemic and dealing with the impact of the war in Ukraine. Despite all these challenges, I'm pleased to say that we've had a very successful quarter. Our total revenue in Q4 was $1.5 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 16%. Adjusted EBITDA also increased 16% to $276 million, with a margin of 18.4% compared to 17.2% in the prior year quarter. These results were driven by growth across all revenue lines, as well as the benefit from settling certain copyright infringement cases, as we discussed on our last earnings call. Recorded music revenue was $1.24 billion, an increase of 13%. Streaming revenue grew 10.4% when adjusted for the one-time impact of the DSP renewal we've been discussing since Q1. I'd like to remind everyone that Q4 was the final quarter impacted by this renewal. Q4\u2019s uptick in subscription streaming growth, and the benefit from emerging streaming platform deal renewals, more than offset the decline in ad-supported revenue. Artist services continued to recover in Q4, increasing by 33%, while licensing and physical were up by 38% and 6%, respectively. Publishing had another impressive quarter, with revenue of $254 million, reflecting exceptional growth of 32% plus. Digital and performance revenue stood out, growing 39% and 48%, respectively. As I look back on the last two and a half years since going public, it's clear that we haven't for a single day operated in a normal environment. So, it's gratifying to report that our businesses continued to shine during fiscal \u201922. For the full year, we delivered total revenue growth of 16% and adjusted OIBDA growth of 18%. Excluding one-time items, adjusted OIBDA grew 22%. We converted 65% of our adjusted OIBDA to operating cash flow for fiscal \u201922, well in excess of the expectation we discussed last quarter of 50% to 60%. As we look ahead, there's tremendous momentum in both the short and long-term. I've consistently told you that streaming revenue would continue to have significant runway, that we would have price increases and ongoing subscriber growth, and that emerging platforms would continue to expand. We're now seeing all these come to fruition. Most significantly, Apple and Deezer recently announced price increases. Making these announcements in the current economic environment, shows that music subscription services offer amazing value to consumers. Music remains undervalued, but we're optimistic that there will be other increases to come. We're also encouraged by reports of subscriber growth. Developed markets continue to grow in the double digits, while emerging markets are growing at higher percentages. With global smartphone penetration expected to increase meaningfully in the coming years, our conviction in streaming growth remains strong. Finally, the revenue growth curve of emerging streaming platforms continues to outpace more established formats. These new platforms are all heavily reliant on music. And as engagement continues to grow, we expect monetization to follow suit. In our recent deal with Meta, our annualized revenue from this category reached $370 million this quarter. We look forward to the continued evolution of our deals as these platforms harness the power of user-generated content, not just for music discovery, but for marketing and monetization. You've often heard me reference the four key pillars of our long-term strategy, music, globalization, innovation, and people. So, I'd like to talk about how these pillars have shaped our culture over the last decade and how they continue to drive our results. Let's start with the music. What distinguishes the Warner Music Group is our ability to identify and sign original artists at the beginning of their careers and develop them into the world's most recognizable superstars. We discovered many of our biggest names like Ed Sheeran, Cardi B, Dua Lipa, Bruno Mars, and Anita, when they were just starting out. Q4 exemplified the impact of our multi-pronged approach. We had great carryover success from our key artists like Ed, Dua, and Silk Sonic. Newly minted superstars, Jack Harlow and Zach Bryan, had multimillion selling albums released in Q3. And Lizzo\u2019s phenomenal singles were a precursor for her chart-topping album, Special, released in Q4. We've also proved once again that music can come from anywhere and resonate everywhere. Not only do we develop Anglo blockbusters, but also superstars within their domestic regions. Local chart toppers, like Japan's Aimyon, and South Korea\u2019s Twice, and international superstars like France\u2019s David Guetta, Argentina\u2019s Paulo Londra, and Nigeria's Burna Boy.  In addition, given the growing consumption of catalog music, we placed even more emphasis on spotlighting our legendary artists. Recent highlights include great looks for Kate Bush, Fleetwood Mac, and Led Zeppelin. As we broadened and deepened our artist roster, and prioritized a global approach to domestic music, our revenue composition has evolved. A decade ago, our top five artists generated over 15% of our recorded music physical and digital revenue. In 2022, they generated just over 5%. Our momentum will continue with a strong release slate in Q1, including new music from Paramore, Aya Nakamura, Cardi B, Peter Fox, Roddy Ricch, Joel Corry, and more. I should also mention our outstanding showing in the Grammy nominations announced last week. Recorded music picked up more than 80 nods, which included half of the album of the year contenders. Our top nominees were Elektra\u2019s Brandi Carlile with seven, and six each for Atlantic\u2019s Lizzo, and 300\u2019s Mary J. Blige. We also had three best new artist nominations for Anita, Omar Apollo, and Molly Tuttle. And Warner Chappell had a great showing, highlighted by nominations for The Dream and Amy Allen in the brand-new category of songwriter of the Year. Warner Chappell is also performing very well, delivering on its strategy of diversifying revenue streams, while providing wider opportunities for songwriters globally. Here are a few recent highlights. In the US, Daniel Caesar took home Song of the Year for Peaches at the 2022 BMI R&B and Hip Hop Awards. We signed pop sensation, Lauren Spencer-Smith, and breakout punk rock band, the Linda Lindas. We renewed our deal with eight-time Grammy Award winner, Chris Stapleton, and we entered into a license renewal with China-based social platform, Kuaishou, for our catalog across multiple Asia PAC countries. We constantly work to enhance the value of our songwriters\u2019 catalogs. Our teams proactively find needle-moving placements to their music, which distinguishes us from passive right holders. One recent example of this is the placement of George Michael's Freedom, covered by Warner superstar Dua Lipa, in a Yves Saint Laurent campaign that launched in August. There's been a lot of debate over the value of major labels and publishers in a world where artisan songwriters have any number of distribution alternatives. While distribution has been democratized, talent never will be. Genuine talent is rare and difficult to find, but discovery is just the beginning. True long-term success requires significant resources, including financial investment, global infrastructure, creative expertise, and the skills to navigate the changing tech landscape. It's that combination, genuine talent backed by our considerable resources and skills, that builds careers for the long haul. Over and over again, artists and songwriters not only stay, but grow their relationships with us in this fiercely competitive market. That's when we know we're on the right track. 10 years ago, we were an Anglocentric company. Today, we\u2019re a truly global music entertainment company, operating in over 70 countries. The key to our successful global expansion has been in identifying markets on the brink of ignition. We've customized for each new territory market and presence-building strategies. A couple of examples from the past decade are, the 2014 acquisition of Gold Typhoon in China, and the critical mass we've built in MENA, the world's fastest-growing market, through our investments in Qanawat, (indiscernible), and Rotana. We see Eastern Europe as a new and important growth area for music. Consumption in the region, which has a population of some 160 million people, grew 20% in 2021. Seizing on this opportunity, we've made moves to grow our presence. Examples include, our recently announced investments in Grupa Step, and BIG Idea in Poland, Mascom Records in Serbia, and the launch of OUT OF ORDER, a new label that will elevate artists in Eastern Europe and other emerging markets. The expansion of our global footprint has been further complemented by entering into partnerships with more than 200 streaming services around the world.  In the music entertainment business, new technologies and business innovations they've driven, have often been met with fear rather than excitement. But today, we see tech as providing us with incredible opportunities to enhance the world of music. We've consistently been a first mover in investing across the digital landscape. Our early embracive streaming made us the first major to report it as our largest source of recorded music revenue back in 2016. Around that time, we also began our revenue diversification efforts. Since then, we\u2019ve partnered with nearly every major social platform, including Instagram, Facebook, Snap, Twitch, TikTok, and most recently, Pinterest. In many cases, we were the first major to do so. These deals are empowering our artists to scale their communities, encouraging fans to share user-generated content, and delivering significant incremental value. We were also the first major to aggressively pursue opportunities in the Metaverse. While our work in Web3 space has accelerated over the last 12 months, our efforts started back in 2019 when we invested in leading blockchain company, Dapper Labs. Our partnerships with Roblox, Fortnite, and Wave, have created innovative opportunities for virtual world-building, concerts, and other forums. This has allowed us to work with artists like Twenty One Pilots and Charli XCX, in pioneering new forms of fan engagement. Through our deal with Sandbox, we were the first major to plant a flag and build on virtual real estate. WMG Land, our current working title, is now Live in the Sandbox, and Atlantic\u2019s Sueco, was the first artist to become part of the experience. I'm very proud of the progress we\u2019ve made over the past 10 years. We've moved way beyond thinking in terms of singles, albums, and videos. We help artists create all forms of rich, immersive interactions with their music in both the real and virtual worlds.  As I look out on the next 10 years, I believe we're at the doorstep of a new golden age of music. As the ecosystem becomes more complex and exciting new business models emerge, our role as the connective tissue between artists and fans, will only become more prominent and more important. Finally, our people are the driving force that will always take our company to the next level. Last month, we announced that Julie Greenwald had been elevated to Chair and CEO of the newly created Atlantic Music Group. Julie's been with the company for 18 years, and it's industry mavericks like her that are the backbone of our success. We've enhanced our focus around important areas like ESG and diversity. Last year, we hired a head of ESG and established an executive oversight committee. On February 1 of \u201822, we released our first annual ESG report detailing our commitment to sustainability, equity, and social impact. Our second annual report will be published this coming January. In 2020, we hired a Global Head of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. We've since established global North Star commitments and launched our DE&I Institute. And we created the $100 million Warning Music Group Blavatnik Family Foundation Social Justice Fund, that invests in organizations and advances community initiatives around the globe. To date, the fund has already committed over $24 million in grants. On November 1, we published the Protect Black Art Open Letter in the New York Times and the Atlanta Journal Constitution. The letter urges legislators across the US to end the racially discriminatory practice of treating rap lyrics as criminal confession. Signatories included companies such as Universal, Sony Music, Spotify, and TikTok, organizations such as the ACLU, Color of Change, the Recording Academy, and the RIAA, and artists such as Alicia Keys, Coldplay, Drake, Megan the Stallion, and Post Malone, among many others. I'm pleased to see us creating new opportunities in our local communities using our resources to express our values and taking a stand on important issues. At the end of September, we announced that Robert Kyncl will become CEO during January \u201923, and then CEO on February 1. As an entrepreneurial leader, Robert has an impressive track record of championing change at companies like YouTube and Netflix. He's a pioneer of the creator economy, whose command of technology will enable us to unlock new opportunities for our company, our artists, and our songwriters. I have the utmost confidence that he'll build upon our strong foundation and bring us into a new era of how music lives in the world.  With that, I'll turn it over to Eric.\nEric Levin: Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Against a backdrop of currency fluctuations, the weak ad market, inflation, and war, our 2022 results truly highlight the resilience and diversified nature of our business. Despite the many macro challenges, we delivered double-digit growth for Q4 and the full year across a number of key metrics, including, total revenue on a constant currency basis, adjusted OIBDA, and operating cash flow, which, as Steve mentioned, exceeded our full year expectations. Let me provide some detail on our results in Q4. Total revenue grew 16%, reflecting growth across recorded music and music publishing. I want to note that our revenue includes the benefit from settling certain copyright infringement cases, as we discussed on our last earnings call. The $38 million impact is reflected in downloads and other digital revenue. Adjusted OIBDA increased 32.5%, with a margin of 17.7%, compared to 15.5% in the prior year quarter. These increases were primarily due to strong operating performance, as well as $29 million from the copyright settlement. Adjusted OIBDA and margin growth were impacted by foreign exchange rates, as well as two one-time items. These were the copyright settlement I just mentioned, and the impact of a DSP renewal we've been discussing since our earnings call since Q1. Excluding these items, constant currency adjusted OIBDA grew 33%, and margin would have increased 200 basis points. Adjusted EBITDA increased 16.5%, with margins increasing from 17.2% to 18.4%. You can find our adjusted EBITDA reconciliation in our earnings press release. Recorded music revenue grew 13.1%. Streaming revenue increased 5%, reflecting continued growth in subscription streaming, and a recent deal with Meta, partially offset by the market-related slowdown in ad-supported revenue, and the impact of the DSP renewal. Adjusting for the DSP renewal, which had a $38 million impact in the quarter, streaming revenue grew by 10.4%. This growth was highlighted by subscription streaming growth in the low teens, a sequential improvement from Q3. However, ad-supported streaming revenue, which does not include revenue from emerging streaming platforms, saw increasing pressure and declined by high single digits. Adjusting for the impacts of the DSP renewal and the copyright settlement, recorded music revenue grew by 14.2%. Artist services and expanded rights revenue increased by 33%, driven by merchandising and concert promotion. Physical revenue also increased, with growth of 6%, primarily driven by higher sales of final products and strong performance in Japan. Licensing revenue grew by 38% due to higher broadcast fees, synchronization, and other activity. Recorded music adjusted OIBDA increased by 20%, with margin improving from 17.2% in the prior quarter to 18.2%, primarily due to strong operating performance, as well as a $15 million impact from the copyright settlement. Excluding the one-time items detailed earlier, adjusted OIBDA grew 26% on a constant currency basis, and margin improvement would have been approximately 170 basis points. Music publishing continues to deliver impressive results, hosting 32% growth. Digital revenue grew 39%, reflecting solid momentum in streaming, which increased 37%. Digital revenue includes a $7 million benefit in downloads and other digital revenue from the copyright settlement. Excluding this benefit, digital revenue increased 33%. Performance revenue increased by 48%, as revenue from bars, restaurants, concerts, and live events, continued to grow. We saw particularly strong recovery in Brazil, UK, Germany, and the US. Sync and mechanical revenue both increased by over 8%. Music publishing adjusted OIBDA increased 33% to $60 million, with margin increasing modestly. Excluding the impact of the copyright settlement, adjusted OIBDA would have increased 31% on a constant currency basis, and margin would have increased 50 basis points.  Moving to our full year results, total revenue grew 16%, driven by double-digit growth in both recorded music and music publishing. This translated to a healthy adjusted OIBDA growth of 18%, with a margin of 19.4%, up from 19.1% in the prior year. Excluding one-time items, the details of which can be found in our earnings press release, constant currency adjusted OIBDA increased 21.6%, and margin increased 70 basis points to 18.6%. Full year adjusted EBITDA increased 9.7%, with margin decreasing from 20.6% to 20.2%. Recorded music revenue increased by 13.6% or 15.2% when normalized for one-time items. Within recorded music, streaming revenue grew 9.5% or 13.5% on a normalized basis. Adjusted OIBDA increased by 12%, with margin declining by 30 basis points to 21.1%. Excluding the one-time items, adjusted OIBDA increased 17% on a constant currency basis, with margin increasing 30 basis points to 20.4%. Music publishing revenue increased by 30% or 27% when normalized for one-time items. Adjusted OIBDA increased by 35%, with margin increasing from 23.4% to 24.3%. Excluding the one-time items, adjusted OIBDA increased 32% on a constant currency basis, with margin increasing 100 basis points. In line with our expectations, Q4 CapEx increased to $38 million as compared to $35 million in the prior year quarter, mainly due to investments in IT infrastructure. I want to note that our financial transformation program has encountered a delay as a result of the disruption of COVID-19. In addition, the size and scale of this global system implementation, requires us to invest more time performing the rigorous system testing and data validation to ensure go live readiness. We expect the program to meaningfully roll out in 2024 and expand globally in the following couple of years. The program is still expected to deliver annualized run rate savings of $35 million to $40 million once fully implemented. However, the delay will result in a reduction in pro forma impact of cost savings that we account for in our adjusted EBITDA reconciliation in fiscal \u201822 and \u201923.  We saw very strong operating and free cash flow growth and conversion in Q4. Operating cash flow increased 78% to $406 million, from $228 million in the prior year quarter. Free cash flow increases 91% to $368 million, from $193 million in the prior year quarter. For the full year, operating cash flow increased 16% to $742 million, and free cash flow increased 11% to $607 million. We delivered operating cash flow conversion, calculated as the ratio of operating cash flow to adjusted OIBDA of 65% for the full year. This was well above our expectation of 50% to 60% that we discussed last quarter. The over-delivery was largely driven by our strong operating performance in Q4, higher recruitments, and the timing of A&R investment and deal renewals. I want to emphasize that some of our Q4 over-delivery was the impact of timing. While we believe that our targets are reasonable, we view them as a multiyear period, and there will be lumpiness in working capital that will impact our operating cash flow to adjusted OIBDA conversion rates from quarter to quarter. As of September 30, we have a cash balance of $584 million, total debt of $3.7 billion, and net debt of $3.1 billion. Our weighted average cost of debt is 3.5%, and our nearest maturity date is in 2028.  Fiscal \u201823 is already off to a very solid start, even as the challenging macro environment persists. While there is still softness in the online ad market, we believe it is a temporary dislocation, and that we will be well positioned to capitalize on the inevitable recovery. We are excited about the recent price increases announced by several of our digital partners, as well as the opportunity for more to come. The runway for streaming growth remains strong as global penetration continues to increase, and the next wave of emerging opportunities take shape. Music is no longer reliant on any one format or distribution channel. It is an essential part of every form of entertainment. The momentum in the music entertainment business is strong, and we continue to position ourselves for long-term success and growth. We're excited about the next chapter, and we look forward to having Robert on board to lead us into new frontiers. Finally, Steve. Steve, and I, have been doing these calls together for the past eight years. It's been a true joy to share the mic with him. On behalf of everyone at the company, I want to thank Steve for an amazing decade of growth and success. He's led this company brilliantly through an era of incredible change, both in our industry and the world at large. Steve, thank you so much. And thank you to everyone for joining us today. We'll now open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Benjamin Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is no open.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Thank you. Good morning. A couple of questions. Maybe just to start with, Steve, stepping back, you've been there and watched the industry go from declining to growing during your tenure as CEO. When you step back and think about your time at Warner Music, what's been the biggest change for the industry, the company, the one you think will have the biggest impact as we all look forward over the next five to 10 years?\nSteve Cooper: Well, thanks for the question, Ben. Happy Thanksgiving. I think the easy answer is streaming, but at least what I believe at Warner, it's really been for us a shift in our mindset, and that shift has been driven by our evolution from an Anglo-American music company to a global music entertainment platform, from thinking about our business in terms of rigid formats, to really moving to offering fans access to unlimited, ubiquitous music in every way, shape, and form in the real land and the virtual worlds. We moved from a narrow set of artists deals to expanding our definitions of artists and partnerships and offering much broader suites of services. And the mind shift has really been built on a foundation of running Warner as one company and one team with a common set of goals. And I think that, at least for us, that as the ecosystem becomes more and more complex, that by having that mind shift, and by working as one team, that that connected tissue that we provide between artists and fans, and what we do to move the value of music to its appropriate place, will just become more and more apparent as time goes by. And I'm happy to say that with my colleagues, I played a part in creating that mind shift, and I'm very confident that we will continue to embrace, adapt and adopt, adapt and adopt, as the world of music continues to evolve.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Thank you, Steven. All the best in the next chapter for you. Eric, could you just help us think about the emerging streaming opportunity in fiscal \u201823? Obviously, you're always at work trying to get music valued appropriately, but I think it's potentially a busy year for you in terms of contract renewals. And in particular, given what's happening with YouTube and ad-supported streaming, TikTok is one of kind of paramount import for your business because they seem to be taking share from YouTube and others. So, could you just help frame sort of the year ahead on the emerging streaming front of what we should be focused on, on our end?\nEric Levin: Sure. So, thanks, Ben, and nice hearing from you. So, again, don't want to get into specific deals, but broadly the category. So, you're right, Ben. So, in fiscal \u201821, we had a series of deals that we did or renewed. And generally, we do deals in two to three-year cycles. So, \u201823, we would expect to be the start of that process. Broadly, that category consists of more and more licenses, with growing consumption. We see that category as a growing category for the long, long term to come. Each deal and each contract will be negotiated individually. Some of the companies within that category have been highly successful and scaled, and others have had more challenges. So, each deal will meet where that partner is, but it\u2019s our objective deal by deal to get the full and appropriate value of music, and we'll be negotiating for each deal assertively to make sure each deal is valued properly. The other thing to note is that these deals, as we've talked about in the past, are generally fixed-fee deals. It\u2019s our objective over time to move these deals to or towards being variable. We know that's not going to all happen in one renegotiation across the board, but we'll be working towards that end. And obviously, as deals move variable, the growth curve would be smoother and in line with monetization and consumption growth, whereas with fixed--fee deals, it's more of a stair step and you try to capture the expected growth in the platform within a fixed-fee over that period of time. So, we'll be working each negotiation and seeing what we can accomplish there. And the last thing I would say is Web3. Web3 is an emerging category that we're actively driving in market experiments. Steve talked about the experiment we're doing in the Sandbox now with others in flight. We see that as an area that over time is quite promising, and we think is going to be a contributor to the long-term growth of our new digital revenue. Hope that helps, Ben.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Yes, absolutely. Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi. Your line is now open.\nJason Bazinet: I just had one quick question regarding your calendar year, or your reporting schedule for next year, because I think you guys are shifting from that sort of 53-week that happens every four years, to something more normalized. So, can you just help us as we think about modeling \u201823 and beyond, where we'll see sort of the greatest distortion? Is it in the fourth quarter of next year? Is that the right answer, and then everything gets smooth after that?\nEric Levin: Jason, thank you. Good - I'm glad you hit on that. Good question. It's an important one. So, yes, we've now shifted to calendar quarters. And so, we'll see the main real impact in fiscal Q1 of \u201823. We disclosed that in fiscal Q1 of \u201822, we had kind of that extra week. As there's a 53rd week, you get an extra week in one quarter. That was in Q1 of \u201922. So, that will be a comparative item in Q1. But the rest of - for the following quarters in Q - I'm sorry, in fiscal \u201823, we'll expect a consistent year and year comparison with the same number of weeks. But in Q1, we will have that to address, and we disclosed that last year, and we'll continue to make sure we're careful about that when we report Q1 results.\nJason Bazinet: Okay, thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kutgun Maral with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nKutgun Maral: Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. Two, if I could. So, first, Steve, congratulations again on a long and successful run at WMG. If I could follow up on the question earlier and maybe ask it a bit differently. As you reflect back on the last two and a half years following the IPO, are there any parts of the story that you feel remain misunderstood, or at least underappreciated by investors? And second, for Eric, on recorded music streaming revenue, the 10.4% underlying growth was particularly strong, and it certainly seems to be ahead of your peers. I'm not expecting multiyear guidance, and I know the ad-supported piece remains uncertain, but can you help frame the puts and takes for 2023 a bit, and maybe update us on your longer-term expectations, specifically around the subscription front? You had very attractive low teens growth in the fourth quarter. Is that a good benchmark heading into \u201823? Could it be higher given Apple Music, or are there offsets we should be mindful of? Thanks.\nSteve Cooper: All right. So, Eric, I'll go first, and thanks for the question. I do think that our business is to a certain degree, misunderstood, and it's misunderstood in the following context. When you look at the results we produce over the longer term, call it for argument\u2019s sake, a year, versus the shorter term, our march for the last, I don't know, nine or 10 years, has been steadily northward bound, both by way of the topline and by way of the bottom line. And my expectation would be that that steady march North will continue for the foreseeable future. That being said, I think that many investors evaluate us on a quarter to quarter to quarter basis. And as I believe many of our investors have seen, that quarters can be impacted by any number of extraneous items. But as those extraneous items, whether it be shifts and release schedules, getting a deal done a quarter late versus a quarter early, what we have done, both by bolstering our investments in recorded music, by bolstering our investments in publishing and with publishing now having lagged by way of the growth of digital revenue, is now leading by way of that growth through the focus that we've put on diversification over the last four or five or six years. Diversification, both geographically, that is local language, with emerging platforms, emerging markets, that I think that all of these quarter-to-quarter blips have a tendency to be ironed out over an extended period of time. Again, call it a year, and that the really observant investors will see that despite those blips, that year-to-year, year-to-year, year-to-year, that march North continues. And it's continued this year despite choppiness in a couple of quarters. So, I think it's - valuing us or evaluating us as a quarterly business, is somewhat misguided. And I think evaluating us on an annual basis or a rolling 12-month basis is, at least from my perspective, a far better way of looking at how we are doing, the health of our company, and the trends we're setting. So, hopefully, that answers your question.\nEric Levin: Good. I fully agree with Steve on that. So, Kutgun, thank you for both your questions. I'll answer your second one on streaming. So, let me break that into two pieces, kind of 2022 and then forward-looking. So, in 2022, on an adjusted basis, meaning looking at the underlying trends of streaming, Q4 grew 10% and the full year grew 13%. Very strong streaming results in a challenging macro market. In Q4, we saw subscription streaming grow low teens, a very strong result. Ad-supported though is significantly affected by the macro environment. Ad-supported declined and declined in the high single digits this quarter. As we look forward, we think there's a lot to be really quite positive and optimistic about. I will point towards Goldman's Music in the Air forecast, just because it gives an interesting and we think useful template to look at. They see subscribers doubling, or quite frankly, more than doubling over the next seven to eight years. It's driven by a couple of components, and each of the components I'll try and address and paint what we think is the picture. Developed markets, which are round, which are penetrated in the 30% now, we've seen market studies and forecasts that predict that increasing to 50s or even 60% penetrations as you look forward five, six, seven years. We think we are seeing consistent growth in developed markets today, and we think there's a lot of runway to be looking forward to. What is now really additive to that is, we've seen price increases just in the past quarter from Apple, Deezer. Others have talked publicly about considering price increases. We think the environment for price increases has changed, and we are optimistic about continued pricing increases going forward, and that is additive, especially in developed markets. We think developed markets for subscription streaming has a lot of growth in front of it, and we're really pleased with the potential and opportunity there. Emerging markets are growing even faster than developed markets. The penetrations across emerging markets on average are still single digits, and have the opportunity to grow into the 10s, 20s, and hopefully over time, even the 30s. Although the average ARPU is lower in emerging market, their rate of growth has increased, and we think has tremendous promise. We've also been investing at Warner into what we think are some of the most promising emerging markets. Steve, in his talking points, talked about our investments in the Middle East, which in \u201821 was the world's fastest growing market, growing, I believe, 35%, and we're building our market share into that growth. So, we see emerging markets as being a real opportunity for subscriber growth, revenue growth, but also for us to develop real footholds and develop our market share and footprints. Ad-supporting has been more challenging in the short term. Remember before the macro environment was so challenging, ad-supported would grow in line double digits pretty consistently with subscriptions. But when macro environments get difficult, one of the first things that we've seen consistently gets - is affected negatively is ad-supported. We saw it when COVID hit in 2020, and we're seeing it now. The ad-supported market is in decline. Even though consumption of products go up, just monetization has gone down in the short term. When the macro environment starts to improve and economies start to improve, we would expect to see that improve and ad-supported to rebound strongly and go back to growth. We also see the emerging streaming category as one that is still in early stages, with more diversified revenue streams, increased number of partners and deals, and growth within many of the key partners within that category. So, we see - and Web3 as an emerging component. So, we see the emerging streaming bucket as one that is a continued growth area for us, noting that our deals, many of our deals in there are fixed price, that the growth is not consistent. It can be lumpy, but over time, we see it as an extremely promising growth contributor. So, we see streaming as a very diversified form of growth now globally across subscription, social, fitness, Web3, and we're very pleased with how it's developing, and see it as an area that we're really optimistic growth going forward. Thanks, Kutgun.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nStephen Laszczyk: Thank you. Good morning. Steve, congratulations on your retirement from Warner. Maybe two questions if I could. First, on market share, you had some notable releases, album releases in the back half of the fiscal year. Could you maybe talk a little bit more about how those impacted market share in the quarter? And then looking forward, how the release slate is shaping up relative to other major labels as we head into 2030. And then a follow up to Ben\u2019s question on emerging, maybe for Eric. The labels are in the process of negotiating with ByteDance owners and looking to expand its regular service. It'd be great to get your latest thoughts on the opportunity you see to improve monetization of ByteDance at a holistic level, whether that's on the TikTok side of the house or with the expansion of ByteDance itself. Thank you.\nSteve Cooper: Okay. So, while I can\u2019t talk about our release slate in specifics, we did touch upon those albums that we know have either dropped or will drop in the first quarter. But what I will say is that our diversification, our geographic diversification, and our focus over the last decade in growing, not only our Anglo, but our non-Anglo business, has provided us with a tremendous amount of what I would call release resiliency, that we have local, regional, and global superstars bubbling up from many, many, many different parts of the world. And because of - because we've created both a geographic, read domestic music, local language portfolio, along with our Anglo portfolio, Stephen, it gives us a tremendous amount of resiliency by way of quarter in, quarter out, year in, year out momentum, where we have become less and less dependent upon any particular artist, and less and less dependent upon blockbusters, because this portfolio is consistently hitting singles, doubles, triples, and home runs. So, that's kind of on the slate point.  On market share, market share moves around a bit, often driven by the strength or more strength or less strength in release schedules. One of the things I would point out though is that while there are various reports on share moving to labels or artists that aren't affiliated with Warner or Sony or Universal, the fact of the matter is, when you continue to look at listening and the listening behavior of people that immerse their selves in music, that we continue to be one of the truly dominant global forces in music when it comes both to share, and as importantly, to hours of listening. So, while you will see small movements, the fact that listening continues to be dominated by Warner, Sony, and Universal, shows, in my view, the fact that - and I mentioned this in my opening remarks, that while access and distribution has become democratized, talent isn't and never will be. Frankly, if talent was democratized, I'd be celebrating my entry into the NBA Hall of Fame. And the fact of the matter is that we seek out real genuine talent, that complemented and supplemented by our resources, our creativity, our skills, create a very meaningful probability that that artist, whether it be on a local, regional, or global level, will be able to be successful. And it's those artists at the local, regional, and global level that are driven by only a few companies in the world, one of which is us, that end up dominating listening hours and the ears of the music-consuming public. Hopefully, that addresses your question, Steven.\nEric Levin: And I'll take the second question. So, on your question on ByteDance, Stephen, so just I'll start by couching a little bit, just that we don't talk to individual deals, but I can certainly talk to our approach, which I think will be helpful. First is, we work with each partner, each platform. And one of our first goals is to help them - and determine how we can work together to help them expand their products, their services, their reach that's positive to consumption, it's positive to competition, all of which we are - we think are favorable to the music industry and Warner. The second piece is, we take each negotiation and we look at the established growth trends and the projected growth trends of that platform and business, and we negotiate each deal to get what we think is full value for music out of that platform. As platforms evolve and there's more information about how they've achieved over the past several years and more clarity into their product and expansion plans for the go-forward term, we will build all of that into our negotiation and attempt to get the best economics that we can out of that deal. Obviously, as I said before, we also seek to move our emerging streaming deals from fixed to variable deals as best as we can. That requires they have the systems. That requires that we're able to resolve the negotiation in a favorable variable form. But these are all things that come into the equation and we work hard to make sure each deal for every single partner is right-sized and structured to help them succeed, to fully value music, and continue to build and expand our partnership. Hope that helps, Stephen.\nStephen Laszczyk: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant with Evercore ISI. Your line is no open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks. This is Ashton for Vijay. I just had a quick question on some of these DSP price increases. Is there sort of any dynamics with the price increases in sort of changes in payment terms versus what you were getting before the price increase? Or is that a negotiation that comes up when DSPs increased price?\nEric Levin: Ashton, I think - sorry, it was a little faded, but I think your question is about price increases and how that affects our economics, if I have that right. And so, what we have said and will continue to remind folks is that our - certainly our major DSP partners are generally all on similar economic terms in a very tight band, and are generally variable deals. So, as price increases roll through the market, we generally expect to share in the upside that that generates. So, as the average ARPU per consumer increases, that's positive and favorable for our economics. What I would say is that each affiliate is a complex mix of how they generate their revenue. They operate across both developed and emerging markets. Subscribers are growing in both developed and emerging markets. Each affiliate has a different mix for what their growth is, the different percentage from developed and emerging markets. ARPUs are different in developed markets and lower in emerging markets. But price increases obviously raise the whole boat and are favorable for us and the industry. And we're thrilled to see that price increases are starting to roll through. It's something we've been advocating for years and years, and it's really nice to see that distributors are starting to recognize that as well. Thank you, Ashton.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to hand the conference back over to Steve Cooper for closing remarks.\nSteve Cooper: Thank you. Just a couple last points. I want to thank my Warner colleagues, our artists, songwriters, partners, board of directors, and shareholders, for allowing me to lead the company over the last 11 years. It's honestly been just an enormous amount of fun, incredibly interesting, and one of the greatest experiences of my working life, and I'm really honored to have been a small part of the incredible Warner Music Group journey. Number two, thanks again for joining us today, and I hope that everyone has a very happy Thanksgiving, and a wonderful holiday season. So, goodbye for now.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Eric Levin",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Against a backdrop of currency fluctuations, the weak ad market, inflation, and war, our 2022 results truly highlight the resilience and diversified nature of our business. Despite the many macro challenges, we delivered double-digit growth for Q4 and the full year across a number of key metrics, including, total revenue on a constant currency basis, adjusted OIBDA, and operating cash flow, which, as Steve mentioned, exceeded our full year expectations. Let me provide some detail on our results in Q4. Total revenue grew 16%, reflecting growth across recorded music and music publishing. I want to note that our revenue includes the benefit from settling certain copyright infringement cases, as we discussed on our last earnings call. The $38 million impact is reflected in downloads and other digital revenue. Adjusted OIBDA increased 32.5%, with a margin of 17.7%, compared to 15.5% in the prior year quarter. These increases were primarily due to strong operating performance, as well as $29 million from the copyright settlement. Adjusted OIBDA and margin growth were impacted by foreign exchange rates, as well as two one-time items. These were the copyright settlement I just mentioned, and the impact of a DSP renewal we've been discussing since our earnings call since Q1. Excluding these items, constant currency adjusted OIBDA grew 33%, and margin would have increased 200 basis points. Adjusted EBITDA increased 16.5%, with margins increasing from 17.2% to 18.4%. You can find our adjusted EBITDA reconciliation in our earnings press release. Recorded music revenue grew 13.1%. Streaming revenue increased 5%, reflecting continued growth in subscription streaming, and a recent deal with Meta, partially offset by the market-related slowdown in ad-supported revenue, and the impact of the DSP renewal. Adjusting for the DSP renewal, which had a $38 million impact in the quarter, streaming revenue grew by 10.4%. This growth was highlighted by subscription streaming growth in the low teens, a sequential improvement from Q3. However, ad-supported streaming revenue, which does not include revenue from emerging streaming platforms, saw increasing pressure and declined by high single digits. Adjusting for the impacts of the DSP renewal and the copyright settlement, recorded music revenue grew by 14.2%. Artist services and expanded rights revenue increased by 33%, driven by merchandising and concert promotion. Physical revenue also increased, with growth of 6%, primarily driven by higher sales of final products and strong performance in Japan. Licensing revenue grew by 38% due to higher broadcast fees, synchronization, and other activity. Recorded music adjusted OIBDA increased by 20%, with margin improving from 17.2% in the prior quarter to 18.2%, primarily due to strong operating performance, as well as a $15 million impact from the copyright settlement. Excluding the one-time items detailed earlier, adjusted OIBDA grew 26% on a constant currency basis, and margin improvement would have been approximately 170 basis points. Music publishing continues to deliver impressive results, hosting 32% growth. Digital revenue grew 39%, reflecting solid momentum in streaming, which increased 37%. Digital revenue includes a $7 million benefit in downloads and other digital revenue from the copyright settlement. Excluding this benefit, digital revenue increased 33%. Performance revenue increased by 48%, as revenue from bars, restaurants, concerts, and live events, continued to grow. We saw particularly strong recovery in Brazil, UK, Germany, and the US. Sync and mechanical revenue both increased by over 8%. Music publishing adjusted OIBDA increased 33% to $60 million, with margin increasing modestly. Excluding the impact of the copyright settlement, adjusted OIBDA would have increased 31% on a constant currency basis, and margin would have increased 50 basis points.  Moving to our full year results, total revenue grew 16%, driven by double-digit growth in both recorded music and music publishing. This translated to a healthy adjusted OIBDA growth of 18%, with a margin of 19.4%, up from 19.1% in the prior year. Excluding one-time items, the details of which can be found in our earnings press release, constant currency adjusted OIBDA increased 21.6%, and margin increased 70 basis points to 18.6%. Full year adjusted EBITDA increased 9.7%, with margin decreasing from 20.6% to 20.2%. Recorded music revenue increased by 13.6% or 15.2% when normalized for one-time items. Within recorded music, streaming revenue grew 9.5% or 13.5% on a normalized basis. Adjusted OIBDA increased by 12%, with margin declining by 30 basis points to 21.1%. Excluding the one-time items, adjusted OIBDA increased 17% on a constant currency basis, with margin increasing 30 basis points to 20.4%. Music publishing revenue increased by 30% or 27% when normalized for one-time items. Adjusted OIBDA increased by 35%, with margin increasing from 23.4% to 24.3%. Excluding the one-time items, adjusted OIBDA increased 32% on a constant currency basis, with margin increasing 100 basis points. In line with our expectations, Q4 CapEx increased to $38 million as compared to $35 million in the prior year quarter, mainly due to investments in IT infrastructure. I want to note that our financial transformation program has encountered a delay as a result of the disruption of COVID-19. In addition, the size and scale of this global system implementation, requires us to invest more time performing the rigorous system testing and data validation to ensure go live readiness. We expect the program to meaningfully roll out in 2024 and expand globally in the following couple of years. The program is still expected to deliver annualized run rate savings of $35 million to $40 million once fully implemented. However, the delay will result in a reduction in pro forma impact of cost savings that we account for in our adjusted EBITDA reconciliation in fiscal \u201822 and '23.  We saw very strong operating and free cash flow growth and conversion in Q4. Operating cash flow increased 78% to $406 million, from $228 million in the prior year quarter. Free cash flow increases 91% to $368 million, from $193 million in the prior year quarter. For the full year, operating cash flow increased 16% to $742 million, and free cash flow increased 11% to $607 million. We delivered operating cash flow conversion, calculated as the ratio of operating cash flow to adjusted OIBDA of 65% for the full year. This was well above our expectation of 50% to 60% that we discussed last quarter. The over-delivery was largely driven by our strong operating performance in Q4, higher recruitments, and the timing of A&R investment and deal renewals. I want to emphasize that some of our Q4 over-delivery was the impact of timing. While we believe that our targets are reasonable, we view them as a multiyear period, and there will be lumpiness in working capital that will impact our operating cash flow to adjusted OIBDA conversion rates from quarter to quarter. As of September 30, we have a cash balance of $584 million, total debt of $3.7 billion, and net debt of $3.1 billion. Our weighted average cost of debt is 3.5%, and our nearest maturity date is in 2028.  Fiscal \u201823 is already off to a very solid start, even as the challenging macro environment persists. While there is still softness in the online ad market, we believe it is a temporary dislocation, and that we will be well positioned to capitalize on the inevitable recovery. We are excited about the recent price increases announced by several of our digital partners, as well as the opportunity for more to come. The runway for streaming growth remains strong as global penetration continues to increase, and the next wave of emerging opportunities take shape. Music is no longer reliant on any one format or distribution channel. It is an essential part of every form of entertainment. The momentum in the music entertainment business is strong, and we continue to position ourselves for long-term success and growth. We're excited about the next chapter, and we look forward to having Robert on board to lead us into new frontiers. Finally, Steve. Steve, and I, have been doing these calls together for the past eight years. It's been a true joy to share the mic with him. On behalf of everyone at the company, I want to thank Steve for an amazing decade of growth and success. He's led this company brilliantly through an era of incredible change, both in our industry and the world at large. Steve, thank you so much. And thank you to everyone for joining us today. We'll now open the call for questions. Sure. So, thanks, Ben, and nice hearing from you. So, again, don't want to get into specific deals, but broadly the category. So, you're right, Ben. So, in fiscal \u201821, we had a series of deals that we did or renewed. And generally, we do deals in two to three-year cycles. So, \u201823, we would expect to be the start of that process. Broadly, that category consists of more and more licenses, with growing consumption. We see that category as a growing category for the long, long term to come. Each deal and each contract will be negotiated individually. Some of the companies within that category have been highly successful and scaled, and others have had more challenges. So, each deal will meet where that partner is, but it's our objective deal by deal to get the full and appropriate value of music, and we'll be negotiating for each deal assertively to make sure each deal is valued properly. The other thing to note is that these deals, as we've talked about in the past, are generally fixed-fee deals. It's our objective over time to move these deals to or towards being variable. We know that's not going to all happen in one renegotiation across the board, but we'll be working towards that end. And obviously, as deals move variable, the growth curve would be smoother and in line with monetization and consumption growth, whereas with fixed--fee deals, it's more of a stair step and you try to capture the expected growth in the platform within a fixed-fee over that period of time. So, we'll be working each negotiation and seeing what we can accomplish there. And the last thing I would say is Web3. Web3 is an emerging category that we're actively driving in market experiments. Steve talked about the experiment we're doing in the Sandbox now with others in flight. We see that as an area that over time is quite promising, and we think is going to be a contributor to the long-term growth of our new digital revenue. Hope that helps, Ben. Jason, thank you. Good - I'm glad you hit on that. Good question. It's an important one. So, yes, we've now shifted to calendar quarters. And so, we'll see the main real impact in fiscal Q1 of \u201823. We disclosed that in fiscal Q1 of \u201822, we had kind of that extra week. As there's a 53rd week, you get an extra week in one quarter. That was in Q1 of '22. So, that will be a comparative item in Q1. But the rest of - for the following quarters in Q - I'm sorry, in fiscal \u201823, we'll expect a consistent year and year comparison with the same number of weeks. But in Q1, we will have that to address, and we disclosed that last year, and we'll continue to make sure we're careful about that when we report Q1 results. Good. I fully agree with Steve on that. So, Kutgun, thank you for both your questions. I'll answer your second one on streaming. So, let me break that into two pieces, kind of 2022 and then forward-looking. So, in 2022, on an adjusted basis, meaning looking at the underlying trends of streaming, Q4 grew 10% and the full year grew 13%. Very strong streaming results in a challenging macro market. In Q4, we saw subscription streaming grow low teens, a very strong result. Ad-supported though is significantly affected by the macro environment. Ad-supported declined and declined in the high single digits this quarter. As we look forward, we think there's a lot to be really quite positive and optimistic about. I will point towards Goldman's Music in the Air forecast, just because it gives an interesting and we think useful template to look at. They see subscribers doubling, or quite frankly, more than doubling over the next seven to eight years. It's driven by a couple of components, and each of the components I'll try and address and paint what we think is the picture. Developed markets, which are round, which are penetrated in the 30% now, we've seen market studies and forecasts that predict that increasing to 50s or even 60% penetrations as you look forward five, six, seven years. We think we are seeing consistent growth in developed markets today, and we think there's a lot of runway to be looking forward to. What is now really additive to that is, we've seen price increases just in the past quarter from Apple, Deezer. Others have talked publicly about considering price increases. We think the environment for price increases has changed, and we are optimistic about continued pricing increases going forward, and that is additive, especially in developed markets. We think developed markets for subscription streaming has a lot of growth in front of it, and we're really pleased with the potential and opportunity there. Emerging markets are growing even faster than developed markets. The penetrations across emerging markets on average are still single digits, and have the opportunity to grow into the 10s, 20s, and hopefully over time, even the 30s. Although the average ARPU is lower in emerging market, their rate of growth has increased, and we think has tremendous promise. We've also been investing at Warner into what we think are some of the most promising emerging markets. Steve, in his talking points, talked about our investments in the Middle East, which in \u201821 was the world's fastest growing market, growing, I believe, 35%, and we're building our market share into that growth. So, we see emerging markets as being a real opportunity for subscriber growth, revenue growth, but also for us to develop real footholds and develop our market share and footprints. Ad-supporting has been more challenging in the short term. Remember before the macro environment was so challenging, ad-supported would grow in line double digits pretty consistently with subscriptions. But when macro environments get difficult, one of the first things that we've seen consistently gets - is affected negatively is ad-supported. We saw it when COVID hit in 2020, and we're seeing it now. The ad-supported market is in decline. Even though consumption of products go up, just monetization has gone down in the short term. When the macro environment starts to improve and economies start to improve, we would expect to see that improve and ad-supported to rebound strongly and go back to growth. We also see the emerging streaming category as one that is still in early stages, with more diversified revenue streams, increased number of partners and deals, and growth within many of the key partners within that category. So, we see - and Web3 as an emerging component. So, we see the emerging streaming bucket as one that is a continued growth area for us, noting that our deals, many of our deals in there are fixed price, that the growth is not consistent. It can be lumpy, but over time, we see it as an extremely promising growth contributor. So, we see streaming as a very diversified form of growth now globally across subscription, social, fitness, Web3, and we're very pleased with how it's developing, and see it as an area that we're really optimistic growth going forward. Thanks, Kutgun. And I'll take the second question. So, on your question on ByteDance, Stephen, so just I'll start by couching a little bit, just that we don't talk to individual deals, but I can certainly talk to our approach, which I think will be helpful. First is, we work with each partner, each platform. And one of our first goals is to help them - and determine how we can work together to help them expand their products, their services, their reach that's positive to consumption, it's positive to competition, all of which we are - we think are favorable to the music industry and Warner. The second piece is, we take each negotiation and we look at the established growth trends and the projected growth trends of that platform and business, and we negotiate each deal to get what we think is full value for music out of that platform. As platforms evolve and there's more information about how they've achieved over the past several years and more clarity into their product and expansion plans for the go-forward term, we will build all of that into our negotiation and attempt to get the best economics that we can out of that deal. Obviously, as I said before, we also seek to move our emerging streaming deals from fixed to variable deals as best as we can. That requires they have the systems. That requires that we're able to resolve the negotiation in a favorable variable form. But these are all things that come into the equation and we work hard to make sure each deal for every single partner is right-sized and structured to help them succeed, to fully value music, and continue to build and expand our partnership. Hope that helps, Stephen. Ashton, I think - sorry, it was a little faded, but I think your question is about price increases and how that affects our economics, if I have that right. And so, what we have said and will continue to remind folks is that our - certainly our major DSP partners are generally all on similar economic terms in a very tight band, and are generally variable deals. So, as price increases roll through the market, we generally expect to share in the upside that that generates. So, as the average ARPU per consumer increases, that's positive and favorable for our economics. What I would say is that each affiliate is a complex mix of how they generate their revenue. They operate across both developed and emerging markets. Subscribers are growing in both developed and emerging markets. Each affiliate has a different mix for what their growth is, the different percentage from developed and emerging markets. ARPUs are different in developed markets and lower in emerging markets. But price increases obviously raise the whole boat and are favorable for us and the industry. And we're thrilled to see that price increases are starting to roll through. It's something we've been advocating for years and years, and it's really nice to see that distributors are starting to recognize that as well. Thank you, Ashton."

            "name": "Steve Cooper",
            "content": "Thanks, Kareem. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As you may know, I'll be stepping down as CEO in January, so this is my last earnings call. I'll have more to say about our leadership transition later, but let's start by talking about what's happening today. It's no secret that we've been challenged on multiple fronts as we navigated the tumultuous macro environment. This includes financial volatility, rising interest rates, inflation, declines in online advertising spend, and currency headwinds. In addition, we've been navigating the complexities created by the pandemic and dealing with the impact of the war in Ukraine. Despite all these challenges, I'm pleased to say that we've had a very successful quarter. Our total revenue in Q4 was $1.5 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 16%. Adjusted EBITDA also increased 16% to $276 million, with a margin of 18.4% compared to 17.2% in the prior year quarter. These results were driven by growth across all revenue lines, as well as the benefit from settling certain copyright infringement cases, as we discussed on our last earnings call. Recorded music revenue was $1.24 billion, an increase of 13%. Streaming revenue grew 10.4% when adjusted for the one-time impact of the DSP renewal we've been discussing since Q1. I'd like to remind everyone that Q4 was the final quarter impacted by this renewal. Q4's uptick in subscription streaming growth, and the benefit from emerging streaming platform deal renewals, more than offset the decline in ad-supported revenue. Artist services continued to recover in Q4, increasing by 33%, while licensing and physical were up by 38% and 6%, respectively. Publishing had another impressive quarter, with revenue of $254 million, reflecting exceptional growth of 32% plus. Digital and performance revenue stood out, growing 39% and 48%, respectively. As I look back on the last two and a half years since going public, it's clear that we haven't for a single day operated in a normal environment. So, it's gratifying to report that our businesses continued to shine during fiscal '22. For the full year, we delivered total revenue growth of 16% and adjusted OIBDA growth of 18%. Excluding one-time items, adjusted OIBDA grew 22%. We converted 65% of our adjusted OIBDA to operating cash flow for fiscal '22, well in excess of the expectation we discussed last quarter of 50% to 60%. As we look ahead, there's tremendous momentum in both the short and long-term. I've consistently told you that streaming revenue would continue to have significant runway, that we would have price increases and ongoing subscriber growth, and that emerging platforms would continue to expand. We're now seeing all these come to fruition. Most significantly, Apple and Deezer recently announced price increases. Making these announcements in the current economic environment, shows that music subscription services offer amazing value to consumers. Music remains undervalued, but we're optimistic that there will be other increases to come. We're also encouraged by reports of subscriber growth. Developed markets continue to grow in the double digits, while emerging markets are growing at higher percentages. With global smartphone penetration expected to increase meaningfully in the coming years, our conviction in streaming growth remains strong. Finally, the revenue growth curve of emerging streaming platforms continues to outpace more established formats. These new platforms are all heavily reliant on music. And as engagement continues to grow, we expect monetization to follow suit. In our recent deal with Meta, our annualized revenue from this category reached $370 million this quarter. We look forward to the continued evolution of our deals as these platforms harness the power of user-generated content, not just for music discovery, but for marketing and monetization. You've often heard me reference the four key pillars of our long-term strategy, music, globalization, innovation, and people. So, I'd like to talk about how these pillars have shaped our culture over the last decade and how they continue to drive our results. Let's start with the music. What distinguishes the Warner Music Group is our ability to identify and sign original artists at the beginning of their careers and develop them into the world's most recognizable superstars. We discovered many of our biggest names like Ed Sheeran, Cardi B, Dua Lipa, Bruno Mars, and Anita, when they were just starting out. Q4 exemplified the impact of our multi-pronged approach. We had great carryover success from our key artists like Ed, Dua, and Silk Sonic. Newly minted superstars, Jack Harlow and Zach Bryan, had multimillion selling albums released in Q3. And Lizzo's phenomenal singles were a precursor for her chart-topping album, Special, released in Q4. We've also proved once again that music can come from anywhere and resonate everywhere. Not only do we develop Anglo blockbusters, but also superstars within their domestic regions. Local chart toppers, like Japan's Aimyon, and South Korea's Twice, and international superstars like France's David Guetta, Argentina's Paulo Londra, and Nigeria's Burna Boy.  In addition, given the growing consumption of catalog music, we placed even more emphasis on spotlighting our legendary artists. Recent highlights include great looks for Kate Bush, Fleetwood Mac, and Led Zeppelin. As we broadened and deepened our artist roster, and prioritized a global approach to domestic music, our revenue composition has evolved. A decade ago, our top five artists generated over 15% of our recorded music physical and digital revenue. In 2022, they generated just over 5%. Our momentum will continue with a strong release slate in Q1, including new music from Paramore, Aya Nakamura, Cardi B, Peter Fox, Roddy Ricch, Joel Corry, and more. I should also mention our outstanding showing in the Grammy nominations announced last week. Recorded music picked up more than 80 nods, which included half of the album of the year contenders. Our top nominees were Elektra's Brandi Carlile with seven, and six each for Atlantic's Lizzo, and 300's Mary J. Blige. We also had three best new artist nominations for Anita, Omar Apollo, and Molly Tuttle. And Warner Chappell had a great showing, highlighted by nominations for The Dream and Amy Allen in the brand-new category of songwriter of the Year. Warner Chappell is also performing very well, delivering on its strategy of diversifying revenue streams, while providing wider opportunities for songwriters globally. Here are a few recent highlights. In the US, Daniel Caesar took home Song of the Year for Peaches at the 2022 BMI R&B and Hip Hop Awards. We signed pop sensation, Lauren Spencer-Smith, and breakout punk rock band, the Linda Lindas. We renewed our deal with eight-time Grammy Award winner, Chris Stapleton, and we entered into a license renewal with China-based social platform, Kuaishou, for our catalog across multiple Asia PAC countries. We constantly work to enhance the value of our songwriters' catalogs. Our teams proactively find needle-moving placements to their music, which distinguishes us from passive right holders. One recent example of this is the placement of George Michael's Freedom, covered by Warner superstar Dua Lipa, in a Yves Saint Laurent campaign that launched in August. There's been a lot of debate over the value of major labels and publishers in a world where artisan songwriters have any number of distribution alternatives. While distribution has been democratized, talent never will be. Genuine talent is rare and difficult to find, but discovery is just the beginning. True long-term success requires significant resources, including financial investment, global infrastructure, creative expertise, and the skills to navigate the changing tech landscape. It's that combination, genuine talent backed by our considerable resources and skills, that builds careers for the long haul. Over and over again, artists and songwriters not only stay, but grow their relationships with us in this fiercely competitive market. That's when we know we're on the right track. 10 years ago, we were an Anglocentric company. Today, we're a truly global music entertainment company, operating in over 70 countries. The key to our successful global expansion has been in identifying markets on the brink of ignition. We've customized for each new territory market and presence-building strategies. A couple of examples from the past decade are, the 2014 acquisition of Gold Typhoon in China, and the critical mass we've built in MENA, the world's fastest-growing market, through our investments in Qanawat, (indiscernible), and Rotana. We see Eastern Europe as a new and important growth area for music. Consumption in the region, which has a population of some 160 million people, grew 20% in 2021. Seizing on this opportunity, we've made moves to grow our presence. Examples include, our recently announced investments in Grupa Step, and BIG Idea in Poland, Mascom Records in Serbia, and the launch of OUT OF ORDER, a new label that will elevate artists in Eastern Europe and other emerging markets. The expansion of our global footprint has been further complemented by entering into partnerships with more than 200 streaming services around the world.  In the music entertainment business, new technologies and business innovations they've driven, have often been met with fear rather than excitement. But today, we see tech as providing us with incredible opportunities to enhance the world of music. We've consistently been a first mover in investing across the digital landscape. Our early embracive streaming made us the first major to report it as our largest source of recorded music revenue back in 2016. Around that time, we also began our revenue diversification efforts. Since then, we've partnered with nearly every major social platform, including Instagram, Facebook, Snap, Twitch, TikTok, and most recently, Pinterest. In many cases, we were the first major to do so. These deals are empowering our artists to scale their communities, encouraging fans to share user-generated content, and delivering significant incremental value. We were also the first major to aggressively pursue opportunities in the Metaverse. While our work in Web3 space has accelerated over the last 12 months, our efforts started back in 2019 when we invested in leading blockchain company, Dapper Labs. Our partnerships with Roblox, Fortnite, and Wave, have created innovative opportunities for virtual world-building, concerts, and other forums. This has allowed us to work with artists like Twenty One Pilots and Charli XCX, in pioneering new forms of fan engagement. Through our deal with Sandbox, we were the first major to plant a flag and build on virtual real estate. WMG Land, our current working title, is now Live in the Sandbox, and Atlantic's Sueco, was the first artist to become part of the experience. I'm very proud of the progress we've made over the past 10 years. We've moved way beyond thinking in terms of singles, albums, and videos. We help artists create all forms of rich, immersive interactions with their music in both the real and virtual worlds.  As I look out on the next 10 years, I believe we're at the doorstep of a new golden age of music. As the ecosystem becomes more complex and exciting new business models emerge, our role as the connective tissue between artists and fans, will only become more prominent and more important. Finally, our people are the driving force that will always take our company to the next level. Last month, we announced that Julie Greenwald had been elevated to Chair and CEO of the newly created Atlantic Music Group. Julie's been with the company for 18 years, and it's industry mavericks like her that are the backbone of our success. We've enhanced our focus around important areas like ESG and diversity. Last year, we hired a head of ESG and established an executive oversight committee. On February 1 of \u201822, we released our first annual ESG report detailing our commitment to sustainability, equity, and social impact. Our second annual report will be published this coming January. In 2020, we hired a Global Head of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. We've since established global North Star commitments and launched our DE&I Institute. And we created the $100 million Warning Music Group Blavatnik Family Foundation Social Justice Fund, that invests in organizations and advances community initiatives around the globe. To date, the fund has already committed over $24 million in grants. On November 1, we published the Protect Black Art Open Letter in the New York Times and the Atlanta Journal Constitution. The letter urges legislators across the US to end the racially discriminatory practice of treating rap lyrics as criminal confession. Signatories included companies such as Universal, Sony Music, Spotify, and TikTok, organizations such as the ACLU, Color of Change, the Recording Academy, and the RIAA, and artists such as Alicia Keys, Coldplay, Drake, Megan the Stallion, and Post Malone, among many others. I'm pleased to see us creating new opportunities in our local communities using our resources to express our values and taking a stand on important issues. At the end of September, we announced that Robert Kyncl will become CEO during January '23, and then CEO on February 1. As an entrepreneurial leader, Robert has an impressive track record of championing change at companies like YouTube and Netflix. He's a pioneer of the creator economy, whose command of technology will enable us to unlock new opportunities for our company, our artists, and our songwriters. I have the utmost confidence that he'll build upon our strong foundation and bring us into a new era of how music lives in the world.  With that, I'll turn it over to Eric. Well, thanks for the question, Ben. Happy Thanksgiving. I think the easy answer is streaming, but at least what I believe at Warner, it's really been for us a shift in our mindset, and that shift has been driven by our evolution from an Anglo-American music company to a global music entertainment platform, from thinking about our business in terms of rigid formats, to really moving to offering fans access to unlimited, ubiquitous music in every way, shape, and form in the real land and the virtual worlds. We moved from a narrow set of artists deals to expanding our definitions of artists and partnerships and offering much broader suites of services. And the mind shift has really been built on a foundation of running Warner as one company and one team with a common set of goals. And I think that, at least for us, that as the ecosystem becomes more and more complex, that by having that mind shift, and by working as one team, that that connected tissue that we provide between artists and fans, and what we do to move the value of music to its appropriate place, will just become more and more apparent as time goes by. And I'm happy to say that with my colleagues, I played a part in creating that mind shift, and I'm very confident that we will continue to embrace, adapt and adopt, adapt and adopt, as the world of music continues to evolve. All right. So, Eric, I'll go first, and thanks for the question. I do think that our business is to a certain degree, misunderstood, and it's misunderstood in the following context. When you look at the results we produce over the longer term, call it for argument's sake, a year, versus the shorter term, our march for the last, I don't know, nine or 10 years, has been steadily northward bound, both by way of the topline and by way of the bottom line. And my expectation would be that that steady march North will continue for the foreseeable future. That being said, I think that many investors evaluate us on a quarter to quarter to quarter basis. And as I believe many of our investors have seen, that quarters can be impacted by any number of extraneous items. But as those extraneous items, whether it be shifts and release schedules, getting a deal done a quarter late versus a quarter early, what we have done, both by bolstering our investments in recorded music, by bolstering our investments in publishing and with publishing now having lagged by way of the growth of digital revenue, is now leading by way of that growth through the focus that we've put on diversification over the last four or five or six years. Diversification, both geographically, that is local language, with emerging platforms, emerging markets, that I think that all of these quarter-to-quarter blips have a tendency to be ironed out over an extended period of time. Again, call it a year, and that the really observant investors will see that despite those blips, that year-to-year, year-to-year, year-to-year, that march North continues. And it's continued this year despite choppiness in a couple of quarters. So, I think it's - valuing us or evaluating us as a quarterly business, is somewhat misguided. And I think evaluating us on an annual basis or a rolling 12-month basis is, at least from my perspective, a far better way of looking at how we are doing, the health of our company, and the trends we're setting. So, hopefully, that answers your question. Okay. So, while I can't talk about our release slate in specifics, we did touch upon those albums that we know have either dropped or will drop in the first quarter. But what I will say is that our diversification, our geographic diversification, and our focus over the last decade in growing, not only our Anglo, but our non-Anglo business, has provided us with a tremendous amount of what I would call release resiliency, that we have local, regional, and global superstars bubbling up from many, many, many different parts of the world. And because of - because we've created both a geographic, read domestic music, local language portfolio, along with our Anglo portfolio, Stephen, it gives us a tremendous amount of resiliency by way of quarter in, quarter out, year in, year out momentum, where we have become less and less dependent upon any particular artist, and less and less dependent upon blockbusters, because this portfolio is consistently hitting singles, doubles, triples, and home runs. So, that's kind of on the slate point.  On market share, market share moves around a bit, often driven by the strength or more strength or less strength in release schedules. One of the things I would point out though is that while there are various reports on share moving to labels or artists that aren't affiliated with Warner or Sony or Universal, the fact of the matter is, when you continue to look at listening and the listening behavior of people that immerse their selves in music, that we continue to be one of the truly dominant global forces in music when it comes both to share, and as importantly, to hours of listening. So, while you will see small movements, the fact that listening continues to be dominated by Warner, Sony, and Universal, shows, in my view, the fact that - and I mentioned this in my opening remarks, that while access and distribution has become democratized, talent isn't and never will be. Frankly, if talent was democratized, I'd be celebrating my entry into the NBA Hall of Fame. And the fact of the matter is that we seek out real genuine talent, that complemented and supplemented by our resources, our creativity, our skills, create a very meaningful probability that that artist, whether it be on a local, regional, or global level, will be able to be successful. And it's those artists at the local, regional, and global level that are driven by only a few companies in the world, one of which is us, that end up dominating listening hours and the ears of the music-consuming public. Hopefully, that addresses your question, Steven. Thank you. Just a couple last points. I want to thank my Warner colleagues, our artists, songwriters, partners, board of directors, and shareholders, for allowing me to lead the company over the last 11 years. It's honestly been just an enormous amount of fun, incredibly interesting, and one of the greatest experiences of my working life, and I'm really honored to have been a small part of the incredible Warner Music Group journey. Number two, thanks again for joining us today, and I hope that everyone has a very happy Thanksgiving, and a wonderful holiday season. So, goodbye for now."

At the request of Warner Music Group today\u2019s call is being recorded for replay purposes, and if you object, you may disconnect at any time. Now I would like to turn today\u2019s call over to your host, Mr. Kareem Chin, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nKareem Chin: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Warner Music Group\u2019s fiscal third quarter earnings conference call. Please note that our earnings press release, earnings snapshot and the Form 10-Q we filed this morning will be available on our website. On today\u2019s call, we have our CEO, Steve Cooper; and our CFO, Eric Levin, who will take you through our results, and then we will answer your questions. Before our prepared remarks, I\u2019d like to refer you to the second slide of the earnings snapshot to remind you that this communication includes forward-looking statements that reflect the current views of Warner Music Group about future events and financial performance. We plan to present certain non-GAAP results during this conference call in our earnings snapshot slides and have provided schedules reconciling these results to our GAAP results in our earnings press release. All of these materials are posted on our website. Also, please note that all revenue figures and comparisons discussed today will be presented in constant currency, unless otherwise noted. All forward-looking statements are made as of today and we disclaim any duty to update such statements. Our expectations, beliefs and projections are expressed in good faith, and we believe there is a reasonable basis for them. However, there can be no assurance that management\u2019s expectations, beliefs and projections will result or be achieved. Investors should not rely on forward-looking statements because they are subject to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors that can cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in our filings with the SEC. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Steve.\nSteve Cooper: Thanks, Kareem. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Given these turbulent times, I\u2019d like to start by reaffirming why we\u2019re so positive about WMG\u2019s future. As the pandemic proved, music is an essential need for humanity. This need has and will continue to make the music sector more resilient than many other industries. Streaming, our largest revenue source has a long runway, and there\u2019s substantial headroom for both subscriber growth and subscription fee increases. We continue to see an explosion of new opportunities in sync, social media, gaming and NFTs, as well as the resurgence of vinyl sales and the bounce back in touring related revenue. Over the long term, we\u2019re no longer reliant on any single format. Today, music propels and monetizes across every form of entertainment. In the digital age, artists have more ways than ever to engage and excite fans, which magnifies the importance and value of music companies such as ours. Against this backdrop, we\u2019re uniquely positioned for long term success. We have the scale, skill set and agility to best capitalize on trends and artists development and drive the globalization and diversification of our business. It\u2019s from this position of strength that we want to be clear about some challenges that we encountered in Q3. We\u2019ve had to deal with very, very significant FX headwinds, as we report in Dollars, not Euros or Yen. The slippage of a number of key album releases into Q4 macro advertising trends resulting in a slowdown in ad supported revenue, and the ongoing suspension of our Russian operations. In addition, our reported results were impacted by several previously disclosed onetime items that affect year-over-year comparisons. These include the deal renewal with one of our digital partners, which affect all four quarters of this fiscal year, but not beyond, and the benefit in the prior year quarter from the catch-up payment related to another of our digital partners. As always, our goal is to help you reconcile reported results to underlying performance. We\u2019re committed to making sure that these items are more clearly understood in the future. Eric will go into more detail about our normalized numbers shortly. So on to our results. Total revenue in the quarter was over 1.4 billion. This represents year-over-year 7% and 12% on an as reported in constant currency basis compared against an incredibly strong Q3 in 2021. Adjusted EBITDA declined 6.7% to 263 million with a margin of 18.4% compared to 21% in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year adjusted EBITDA decline was driven primarily by FX headwinds. The margin decline was impacted by the strong resurgence of our lower margin artists\u2019 services offerings. In recorded music, our revenue was approximately 1.19 billion, an increase of 8.5% from the prior year quarter with streaming revenue up 2.7%. As I mentioned, factors such as ad supported streaming weakness impacted these results. However, these percentage increases do not accurately reflect the true strength of our streaming business. Normalizing for the previously discussed onetime items recorded music streaming revenue grew by 9.2%. Artist services continued to show impressive recovery with revenue growth of 55.7% while licensing was up 8.7% and Physical was up approximately 2%. Publishing had a very strong quarter with revenues of $245 million approximately 35% more than the prior year quarter. I\u2019d like to note, we expect an uplift in our Q4 recorded music streaming revenue, driven by a very strong release slate, including new music from Cardi B, Lizzo. Hanukkah Disco, Argentina\u2019s Paulo Londra, Nigeria\u2019s CK and South Korea\u2019s Aespa. In addition, we have recently signed new deals with Metta that will deliver additional revenue in Q4. Our new deals include an expanded revenue sharing model that will open up additional opportunities for both frontline and catalog artists. With that in mind, I\u2019d like to spend the rest of my remarks today picking up on the theme of why we\u2019re so confident about our future. Many of you have heard me talk before about the key pillars of our long term strategy; music, globalization, innovation, and people. I\u2019d like to explain how we\u2019re distinguishing ourselves in each of these areas, and talk a bit about our ambitions. As always, let\u2019s start with the music. We often get asked whether all the major music companies are just tracking the same data and chasing the same artists. If you look at our biggest stars, you can see that that\u2019s not true for us. Long term artists development has been a hallmark of WMC for decades, with stars like Madonna, Joni Mitchell and Fleetwood Mac among many others. Today, we remain absolutely committed to backing originality. Ed Sheeran, Cardi B, Anita, Dua, Lippa, Bruno Mars and others are all extraordinary artists that were signed to our labels very early in their careers. It should be noted that last month, Ed Sheeran became the first artist to hit 100 million followers on Spotify. Q3 saw the return of Lizzo one of our most talented new superstars. Her Monster hit About Damn Time achieved number one status in U.S. while reaching the top three in Australia, Belgium, Canada, New Zealand and the UK. Released last month her claim new album Special hit the top 10 in key markets, including the U.S., UK, Canada and Australia. The sophisticated multi platform campaign behind Lizzo\u2019s new release is a great example of what\u2019s possible when a true original is backed by our creative global team. By way of example, in April Lizzo made her debut in the Metaverse by performing a song breaker, the first music award show on Roblox. In July, she celebrated her album release with an exclusive live show experience in concert in New York, sponsored by American Express and live streamed on Twitch. In the fall, a documentary about Lizzo\u2019s life is coming to HBO Max. The film is co-produced by Warner Music Entertainment and Atlantic films. Around the world, we\u2019ve had a string of smashes from some of our most exciting international stars, including Nigeria\u2019s Burna Boy, Japan\u2019s Tatsuro Yamashita, and the UK\u2019s LF System. Back in the U.S., Jack Harlow celebrated his first solo single number one, while the Red Hot Chili Peppers 12th studio album debuted at number one in the U.S., the UK, Germany, and 13 other markets around the world. We also helped propel the explosive success of Kate Bush\u2019s Running up that hill in the new season of Netflix Stranger Things. Originally released in 1985, the song returned to number one on Billboard\u2019s global 200 and Spotify his daily global charts. This is a great example of the Evergreen power of unique songs and recordings, as well as further proof that there are no barriers in the modern music business. Irrespective of genre, geography or generation a hit can emerge and reemerge from anywhere from anyone at any time. Meanwhile, our publishing arm Warner Chappell is really humming. Our songwriters scored 86 songs on the Billboard Hot 100 in Q3. Our Nashville team was named Billboard\u2019s Top Country Music publisher for an unprecedented 21 consecutive quarters. Culture shifting songwriters, welcome to Warner Chappell this quarter include dope, who co-produced Drake\u2019s way to sexy, Puerto Rican rapper [Indiscernible] an influential figure in the queer Latin rap scene, and Tyson Yoshi, one of Hong Kong\u2019s top hip hop singer songwriters and independent artists. We also signed a wide ranging partnership with Hollywood star and popular comedian, Kevin Hart and his media company Heartbeat. We\u2019re administering all of heartbeat songs covering past and future works for film, TV, gaming, and Web-3. Our shift to becoming a truly global music enterprise continues to pay off. We\u2019ve taken a two pronged approach, growing our local expertise and talent while making targeted investments and forging partnerships with local best in class operators. A case in point, back in 2014, we were first movers in China taking two important steps that year, we acquired one of the largest independent catalogues, Gold Typhoon, and we were the first major music entertainment company to strike a wide ranging partnership with Tencent. In 2014, China was the 19th ranked music market in the world. Last year, it was in sixth position and climbing. Deals made a number of years ago have been critical to us being in the pole position to capitalize on continued growth in China where our revenue is 7x what it was in 2014. We continue to spot the markets that are going to ignite and deploy a bespoke strategy for each one. We\u2019ve spoken to you in the past about the launch of Warner Music in India, and organic growth market share in Brazil. More recently, we\u2019ve transacted with [Indiscernible] and Rotana in the Middle East, and Chocolate City and Africa, Korea and Nigeria and across Africa. This quarter, we launched Warner Music in Israel, which is a fast growing market with real global potential. Our roster there already includes superstars, Noah Carell, and Noga Rez. And we have some exciting plans to further turbocharge our growth in this market. As a company that thrives at the intersection of art and tech, our commitment to innovation is helping us create a bright future for our artists, our songwriters and ourselves. We\u2019re constantly experimenting with ways to improve, expand and diversify our revenue streams. Last month, we became the first major music entertainment company to adopt SoundCloud span powered royalties model, which pays artists based on individual users streaming habits. This quarter, our in house podcast network presents added shows to our portfolio such as the acclaimed series rap radar, and the Webby nominated Holding court. At the same time, we\u2019ve established a reputation is the company to come to first, if you want to do anything really groundbreaking in music. We continue to harness the tools, tech, and protocols that collectively make up web-3 by constantly learning and evolving, we are simultaneously strengthening our role as the connective tissue between fans and artists by unlocking new opportunities in these rapidly changing environments. Here are just a few examples of our many recent initiatives. Two of our artists, Jason Derulo and [Indiscernible] teamed up with terror zero to recreate real life landmarks on the virtual platform decentraland. This partnership helped us expand our horizons across multiple Metaverse worlds, and tap into new promotional avenues. Warner records UK partnered with Bose to offer a first of its kind NFT collection called Stickman toys. Using a custom built algorithm visual art was mapped to audio stems creating a set of unique collectible characters. Stickman toys has been extremely successful peeking at number two on OpenSea the world\u2019s largest NFT marketplace. And finally, through our participation in a funding round for authentic artists, we\u2019re helping to redefine communal music experiences for the Metaverse. Authentic artists is an industry leading music platform powering virtual artists, digital collectibles and interactive music experiences using cutting edge AI. Before I move on, I\u2019d like to mention that we were pleased by the July 1 remand decision by the U.S Copyright Royalty Board or CRB in Phonorecords II which covers streaming royalties for the 2018 to 2022 periods. After long drawn out appeals process, streaming services are finally being required to pay songwriters and publishers, the percentage of revenue rates that were set by the CRB in February 2019. These rates escalate annually from 11.4% in 2018, to 15.1% in 2022. This marks a hard one increase from the 10.5% rate previously set by the CRB for 2017 in Phonorecords II since many digital services we\u2019re continuing to pay songwriters and publishers at that 10.5% rate during the appeals process, the remand decision will require them to make significant retroactive payments. It\u2019s an important step in the fight for fair compensation for songwriters. Before I talk a bit about our people, I want to honor Mo Austin, the legendary former chairman and CEO of Warner Brothers Records. On August 1, we announced that Mo had passed away peacefully at 95. There was an unbelievable outpouring of loving tributes from across the entire spectrum of artists and executives, who had been part of our industry for decades. Mo was one of the greatest music executives ever. He was a driving force in shaping the Warner Music Group as we know it today. He will be hugely missed, and our deepest condolences go out through his family. I\u2019ll now give a few brief updates about our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion and the ways our people are impacting local communities. First, we\u2019re reinforcing our unique company culture through state of the art headquarters in different territories. The latest example is our music station in Madrid. A creative hub housed in a renovated train station originally built in 1861. This facility and courts recording studios, a content creation lab and a live music venue. Providing round the clock access to spaces like this not only helps us attract and retain talented executives, artists and songwriters, but also fosters creativity and collaboration in a post-COVID world. Second, our Warner Music Group Blavatnik family Foundation\u2019s social justice fund announced its fourth tranche of grantees this quarter, and held its first grantee convening event. 56 leaders from 26 organizations came together to advance social reform across the arts, education and criminal justice. Third, 300 Entertainment and Atlantic Records are leading the fight to prohibit prosecutors in the U.S. from using rap lyrics as confessional evidence in criminal trials. We\u2019re supporting the project Black initiative, whose mission is to end these racially discriminatory attacks on creative expression. Finally, in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, our priority is keeping our people safe. We believe that everyone has the right to control their reproductive health. To that end, we\u2019ve expanded our health care services including financial and legal support, so our employees can exercise that right no matter where they live. In addition, we\u2019ve matched employee donations supporting the important work of the Center for Reproductive Rights. To wrap up, I know that in this current macroeconomic climate, everyone is being inundated with information about short term trends. But while we\u2019re very focused on consistently delivering quarterly results, that\u2019s not the primary lens through which we look at our business. Over the past five years, we\u2019ve grown revenue by 63% on an as reported basis, and adjusted EBITDA of by almost 100%, while generating about 2.5 billion of operating cash flow. In this industry, real success and real returns come from taking the long term view. It\u2019s about setting the right trajectory that will take us to new heights. We believe that the Warner Music Group is absolutely on the right path. And we look forward to keeping you updated as we continue to build tomorrow\u2019s story. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Eric. \nEric Levin: Thanks. Thank you, Steven. Good morning, everyone. Our Q3 results reflect the inherent resilience of our business that comes from our diverse portfolio of revenue streams. Even in a quarter where ad supported streaming revenue came under pressure due to macro trends, we still grew most of our revenue lines and saw significant growth in operating and free cash flow. Total revenue increased by over 12% on a constant currency basis reflecting growth in both recorded music and music publishing. Total company streaming revenue increased 6.5% driven by growth across both segments. Adjusted for the onetime items that I will describe in a moment, total revenue and streaming growth were 14.9% and 10.3% respectively. Companywide streaming revenue from emerging platforms was sequentially flat at $345 million on an annualized basis. As Steve mentioned, this revenue will increase in Q4 driven by new deals with platforms including our recently signed deals with Meta. Adjusted OIBDA declined 3% with margins of 17.8% compared to 19.6% in the prior year quarter. On a constant currency basis adjusted OIBDA increased 2.4%. That decline in margin was primarily due to revenue mix, driven by the growth and lower margin artist\u2019s services revenue, and the impact of exchange rates. The impact to adjusted OIBDA growth and margins was magnified by the reduction in streaming revenue, which was primarily driven by onetime items. Normalizing for these items consolidated adjusted over OIBDA on a constant currency basis grew 13% and margins would have declined by only 40 basis points. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 6.7% with margins declining from 21% to 18.4% due to the same factors that impacted adjusted OIBDA. Recorded music revenue grew 8.5%, driven by growth across all revenue lines. Streaming revenue increased by 3%, compared to a very strong prior year quarter that saw impressive growth of 27%. Our prior year quarter performance was driven by outsize growth and ad supported streaming revenue that was recovering from COVID, new deals with emerging streaming platforms, and some especially successful releases. By comparison, our streaming growth in Q3, 22 was more muted, due to deceleration and ad supported streaming revenue driven by the challenging macro environment, and shifts in the timing of new releases. Normalized subscription streaming revenue grew in low double digits in line with the market. However, ad supported streaming growth, which had been trending in the high teens fell into the low single digits in Q3. Additionally, there were several previously disclosed items that impacted comparability for the quarter. A new deal with one of our digital partners which commenced in Q1 created a $34 million Q3 headwind and an $11 million benefit in the prior year quarter due to a catch up payment related to one of our digital partners. Adjusting for the impact of these onetime items, recorded music total revenue, and streaming revenue grew 13.1% and 9.2% respectively. While the macro challenges to ad supported streaming revenue may persist for some time, we expect streaming growth to improve for us in Q4 bolstered by robust release schedule, a less challenging prior year comparison, and new deals with emerging streaming platforms. Artist services and expanded REITs revenue growth accelerated and increased by 56% primarily reflecting a boost in concert promotion revenue as touring activity returned. Physical revenue grew by 2%, primarily driven by strong performance in Asia. Licensing revenue increased 9%, mainly due to higher synchronization revenue led by the U.S. and UK. Adjusted OIBDA decreased 9% on an as reported basis, and 4% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted OIBDA margin declined from 22% in the prior year quarter to 19.4%, primarily due to revenue mix. Normalizing for the onetime items described above adjusted OIBDA grew 7% on a constant currency basis, and the year-over-year margin declined would have only been 100 basis points. Music publishing continues to deliver impressive results, posting 35% year-over-year growth. Digital revenue grew 32%, reflecting continued momentum in streaming, which increased 35% and was driven by strength across traditional and emerging streaming platforms. Additionally, digital revenue growth reflected a $17 million benefit resulting from the July 1 decision by the U.S. Copyright Royalty Board and Phonorecords III which Steve mentioned earlier. Adjusted for the benefit from this decision, digital revenue increased 16.5% and streaming revenue increased by 18.3%. Performance revenue increased by 80% as bars, restaurants, concerts and live events continued to recover from COVID disruption. We saw a rebound in Germany, UK, France, and the US sync revenue increased by over 20% due to higher television and commercial licensing activity. Mechanical revenue declined slightly. Music publishing adjusted OIBDA increase 30% to $57 million while margin remained flat at 23%. On a constant currency basis adjusted OIBDA increased 33%. Normalizing for the impact of the CRB rate benefit adjusted OIBDA would have increased 23% on a constant currency basis and margin would have been essentially flat. In line with our expectations, Q3 CapEx increased to $35 million as compared to 20 million in the prior year quarter, mainly due to IT, investments in IT infrastructure, and expansion of our EMP facilities. As a reminder, our financial transformation is expected to deliver annualized run rate savings of $35 million to $40 million once fully implemented. Operating and free cash flow growth in Q3 were very strong. Operating cash flow increased 79% to $163 million from 91 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was largely driven by the timing of A&R investment. Free cash flow increased 80% to $128 million from 71 million in the prior year quarter. We expect strong cash flow generation in Q4 as well driven by the timing of deals that will be favorable to working capital. As of June 30, we had a cash balance of $345 million, total debt of 3.8 billion and net debt of 3.4 billion. Our weighted average cost of debt is 3.4% and our nearest maturity date is 2028. Before we conclude our call, I want to mention that we recently settled a number of copyright infringement cases that will impact our Q4 results. We expect that the proceeds from these settlements after netting litigation expenses, and artist and songwriter royalties will have an estimated favorable impact to consolidated OIBDA of at least $25 million. We are closely monitoring the rapidly changing macro environment and we\u2019ll adapt as we always have. We have full conviction and music\u2019s resilience and will aggressively pursue new opportunities for artists and songwriters even during market dislocations. The fourth quarter is off to a strong start with our new releases performing well and new deals with emerging streaming platforms. We are on an upward trajectory and are positioning ourselves to take advantage of the opportunities for growth that lie ahead. Thank you for joining our call today. And we will now open the call for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] First question comes from [Indiscernible] with JPMorgan. Your line is open. \nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, thanks for taking the question. It\u2019s good to hear the confidence and the underlying growth in scope for 4Q based on the deal, other ESP deals and just the new release schedule. Can you perhaps update us on your outlook for or expectations for 2023 given concern about slowing growth industry wide ad supported slowdown that you kind of call that the macro? Perhaps any one time item that will affect comparability as we kind of go into next quarter and into 2023. Thank you.\nSteve Cooper: Yes. Sebastiana thank you so much. So we don\u2019t have, we disclosed the one time. Sebastiana thank you so much. So we don\u2019t have we, we disclosed the onetime items, we don\u2019t have anything next quarter that we are, that we see that is meaningful, that will affect the comparison. We do look forward to 2023 when we will last the anniversary of the DSP renewal that has been creating challenging comparisons for the four quarters of fiscal \u201822. But fundamentally, even though there\u2019s a challenging macro environment, we are very confident in the resilience of music and the effectiveness of Warner Music strategy. We have a strong release schedule for Q4 and are looking forward to further strong releases throughout fiscal \u201823. We see subscription streaming growth continuing to grow double digits, despite what\u2019s happening in the macro environment. Sync continues to grow. Artists services and recorded music is now back to where it was pre-COVID, which obviously is low margin revenue, but delivers revenue and OIBDA and provides a value added services for artists that we always look forward to providing them as part of our relationship. Warner Chappell has been going full guns. Their growth every quarter this year has been 20 plus percent. The recovery of performance has allowed their stellar growth in areas like streaming and sync to shine through. So we feel really good about our underlying business model, we feel really good about the resilience of music and our positioning for continued growth. I don\u2019t want to short sell that it\u2019s a challenging environment, we\u2019ve seen this quarter the impact on ad supported. We continue to make sure we do everything we can to support each line of revenue growth. But FX and ad supported revenue both had challenges this quarter. And we\u2019ll continue to manage them as best as we can. Fortunately, ad supported is a minority of our streaming revenue, and therefore is a contained portion of our revenue. And the larger portion of our revenue is continuing in strong growth mode. So hopefully that gives you a summary. And thank you for your questions Sebastiana.\nUnidentified Analyst: And one quick follow up there. With artist service recovering obviously, you\u2019ve outlined low margin, but still contributes to the OIBDA growth. Any perhaps update on or how should we should be thinking about margins into fiscal 2023 particularly as maybe the financial transformation program kind of gets implemented?\nSteve Cooper: Thank you for that. So one of the things we\u2019ve been saying, quite frankly, for the past couple of years, is when artists service recovered because it was so, it was basically put on hiatus for the first two years of COVID that when it started to recover, and it would have an effect on margins downward. But we didn\u2019t know exactly how much because we didn\u2019t know if artist services recover over two years or recover fully in one year. Artist services is now back to the revenue levels that it was pre-COVID. So it\u2019s really fully recovered in a very, very short period of time. What this does is put margin, downward margin pressure in 2022 but will then create comparisons for 2023, where we\u2019ve got artist services fully baked in \u201822 compared to \u201823. So we expect to get back on our margin growth trajectory, as we have comparisons that are going to be more favorable with the fully recovered artist services in both the numerator and denominator. So we feel very good about the fundamental margin growth program that we have in place growing our high margin digital revenue streams, managing costs, including our financial transformation, other technology initiatives that are in place to drive efficiency. So we feel very good about our margin growth trajectory. Our financial transformation program remains on track to launch in fiscal \u201823. We expect the benefits to start to roll in \u201823 and \u201824 until it\u2019s fully rolled out and complete. I will say that the rollout of the financial transformation is always tied to meeting very specific and detailed standards that allow us to complete our statutory management reporting, essentially perfectly. We are very close to that point. But there is work to do till we crossed dot every I and cross every T. And we\u2019re working diligently to get there. And we fully expect to launch the program at \u201823.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Benjamin Black with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Benjamin Black with Deutsche Bank your line is open. \nBenjamin Black: Hey, guys, thank you. Thanks for taking my question. After two follow-ups really so after adjusting for the new deals and the catch-up payments, we\u2019ve seen a few quarters of decelerating on the line recorded music streaming growth. So the question here is really how should we be thinking about a good underlying growth rate going forward? You\u2019ve seen slowing subscriber growth, or we\u2019re just simply lapping difficult comps. And on the advertising side and Spotify mentioned seeing modest softening last two weeks and into the third quarter. Now you\u2019re mentioning as well. Can you elaborate on the softness that you\u2019re seeing? Is it platform specific? Is it region specific, for example? And how are you thinking about some of the tenure of advertising growth for the balance of the year in 2023? Thank you.\nSteve Cooper: So sure. Let me jump in on that. So thanks for the question. So first thing I\u2019d say is that subscription streaming growth still remains quite strong remains in the double digits. In the short term, we see that as being very strong sign despite a macro environment. Long term, we think subscription streaming growth has tremendous upside potential in front of it. Developed markets are roughly 30% penetrated in aggregate. We\u2019ve seen both research studies, but also market forecasts that showed that growing into the 50s or even 60s percent over time. Emerging markets are still penetrated in the mid single digits and are starting to show real improved growth. And we see enormous opportunity for emerging markets coming online with subscription streaming. The price per subscriber is still very low. We see real ARPU opportunity and Spotify and Amazon that have done forms of price increases, I think, have proven to the market that it doesn\u2019t have an impact on churn and that price increases are really available for distributors who are very excited about subscriber growth opportunities. We did see an ad supported slowdown. You\u2019ve seen that in some of the companies that are distributors that reported lower ad supported growth. Clearly it was a difficult comp versus a year ago. A year ago, we had 27% streaming growth and ad supported growth was even faster than our average total streaming growth because of the recovery from COVID. But we do think the macro environment has had an impact on ad supported businesses and we\u2019ll continue to monitor to that. Again ad supported streaming is in the mid to high teens overall streaming so it\u2019s part of our business and the much larger part of our business continues streaming business continues to grow double digits. But that is something that we\u2019ll continue to monitor. Again, we have great confidence in the long term potential up streaming, we think it\u2019s just getting started, we think the emerging streaming side continues to increase in the number of licenses. We\u2019ve just concluded our new Meta deal the opportunities of web-3, NFTs communities, we think is just at the very, very early experimentation phase and has significant potential, that we\u2019re focused on developing the business models to be able to monetize. So we\u2019re excited as we look forward about the growth in streaming. In the short term we\u2019re navigating tough macros, but still think the resilience of music and streaming gives us real opportunities to continue the growth vectors.\nBenjamin Black: Fantastic. Thank you for the color.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Matthew Thornton with Truist. Your line is open.\nMatthew Thornton: Hey, good morning, Steve and Eric. Maybe one question and two housekeeping items if I could. First, Eric, you talked a little bit about the margin progression as you see it over the next couple of years. How do you think about the conversion have adjusted to free cash flow the next couple years? It was 50% in this quarter is kind of bounced around a bit, but I guess higher level, how do you think about that progressing over the next couple of years? And then just secondly, that the housekeeping items, I think there was an adjustment to an earn out liability that benefited the recorded music margin the quarter if you can quantify that. And in the streaming portion, I think there was some language around timing of new deals. Again, anything worth quantifying there as well? Thanks, guys.\nEric Levin: Those three questions and reading notes really fast. Okay. So three things. So adjusted OIBDA free cash flow. So one thing I would encourage there generally our free cash flow to adjusted OIBDA conversion has been 50%, 60%. We think that\u2019s a reasonable range to operate and every quarter will be different. The timing of spend on A&R is going to vary based on deal activity and really challenging to look at quarter-to-quarter. A larger period of time, year-to-year, for example, is a better period, the 50% to 60% has been a place we\u2019ve been comfortable operating in. We think that\u2019s a fair place to look. I will make the comment though, that we look at our waterfall of how to deploy excess cash. And the first stop at our waterfall is redeploying it into the business to drive future growth. We have grown our market share. If you look at over the past several years, call it a five year period. And one of the ways we do that is by redeploying our operating cash flow back in the business with accretive deals to drive growth. But fundamentally we are driving to drive our operating and free cash flow in line with OIBDA with call it a 50%,, 60% conversion rate. But we then use our waterfall beyond that. Second question. So we had made an investment in the business and had accrued about 10 million towards an earn out that was part of the acquisition if certain metrics were achieved. Given the slowdown in the ad supported market, we no longer forecast that earn out will be achieved and reversed a $10 million accrual on the timing of deals. The one deal we called out here is the Meta deal, which we closed in Q4 and that will be reflected in our Q4 results. We do expect our emerging streaming revenue in our streaming revenue because of that, because of the timing of new emerging streaming deals to have a positive bump in Q4. We were still in the process of driving Q4 and we don\u2019t quantify individual deals. So I can\u2019t give you a number but we do expect that to have positive impact. Thank you, Matthew.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Michael Morris with Guggenheim. Your line is open.\nMichael Morris: Thank you guys. Good morning. Maybe one for Eric. Just following up on digging in a bit to the recorded music streaming trend. You talked a bit about the advertising portion and the size there which was helpful. Can you talk a bit about the release schedule that album release slippage and the impact as we looked at kind of export growth rate going from 15% or mid teens in the second quarter, fiscal second quarter to the 9%, sort of quarter rate in the third quarter. How much of that sequential sort of slowdown was driven by that release late timing? And how much of that kind of do you expect will come back in the fiscal fourth quarter? And then maybe a bigger picture question for Steve, just on the CEO transition, which was announced late in the quarter and a little bit long dated with respect to the timing. Can you just give us your thoughts on that transition? Why the timing? What you guys are looking for? Would appreciate the color there.\nEric Levin: So I\u2019ll start so and thank you, Michael, for the questions. So there was a few substantive releases that have slipped from Q3 to Q4. I will focus a little bit on Q4. We feeling very good about Q4 overall, for the reasons we talked about on the release schedule. Lizzo, who already has a number one hit the album coming out and in Q4 special Cardi B has an album coming out Panic at the Disco, Paulo Londra and several other significant international artists are Q4 release schedule, we think is really set up nicely. And certainly we do see that as being an accelerator versus Q3. In addition to a strong release schedule, the close of several emerging streaming deals, including Meta will be a positive. And we also mentioned that there were several legal settlements in Q4 that will bring approximately 25 million of OBIDA into Q4. So there\u2019s a series of positive news in Q4 that we have already delivered. And that will be impacting the results throughout the remainder of the quarter. On ad supported part of the slowdown was the market. You could look at the results of some of our largest distributors, and see the rate of which they\u2019re slowed down that affects our business. But again, our job is to maximize the performance of that area with releases and great marketing campaigns. And we\u2019re thrilled that the largest part the lion\u2019s share of our subscription revenue of our streaming revenue, which is subscriptions, continues to grow solidly in the double digits.\nMichael Morris: On the CEO transition. I mean, it\u2019s really very straightforward. We decided to announce a change with a long lead time, which would allow us to have a very thorough, thoughtful, broad search a diverse group of candidates. I\u2019m actively in the loop on that process. And I think that I expect that there will be an overlap with respect to the transition. We just want to make sure that it\u2019s well thought out that it\u2019s orderly, and that we continue focusing on business without missing a beat.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Kutgun Maral with RBC. Your line is open.\nKutgun Maral: Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. First, given the divergent trends across subscription, ad supported and emerging platforms, can you just update us on the mix of the three buckets across either recorded music, or your overall digital revenue? Eric, I think you said earlier that advertising is about mid to high teens. But I wanted to confirm and maybe get a little bit more color on emerging platforms as well. And I apologize if I missed it, but how much was emerging platform revenue in the quarter? And just lastly, you were asked earlier about the timing of emerging platform renewals. Emerging platform revenue and growth had decelerated over the last year because you\u2019re kind of in a lull of activity with the Meta deal as we move forward into fiscal 23. Are you entering a new cycle of renewals that could help accelerate the streaming revenue growth line? Thanks.\nSteve Cooper: Thanks Kutgun. So on streaming, rough ballpark, the mix of the components subscriber ad support and emerging is roughly 70, 20, 10 in the high teens 10. So think of subscriber as the 70% ad supported is the high, very high teens and emerging being the rest call it roughly 10. There are some cats and dogs in there like digital radio and things like that. But those are relatively small compared to the bigger pie. Your other question on emerging streaming and the growth components and the trending going forward. There\u2019s a few components to that. Obviously, as you stated Kutgun the renewals are a meaningful part of that, when you have a few deals that have become relatively scaled in there, it becomes meaningful when those are renewed. We don\u2019t talk specifically to the renewal timing of individual deals, obviously, Meta is a meaningful one. We usually do two to three year deals. We had a slew of renewals roughly a year ago, that were actually reflected in our Q3, \u201821 results. So there will be some deals that come up in \u201823. And we will see that in next year\u2019s results. What I will also say is it\u2019s not just about renewals, it\u2019s also about new vectors of growth. We look at areas like Web-3 with NFTs and the ability to build interactive communities as having huge potential. But the platforms and products that develop sustainable business models that really excite fans, and monetize and connect fans and artists in ways that are the deep, rich, and exciting dynamic communities is something that is being experimented with develop. We\u2019re working very closely with a series of partners when we\u2019ve talked about the different deals that we\u2019ve done over the past year or so with best in class partners in NFTs and building out nods with roadblocks and others that is all with an eye towards developing a model for music in this new world that can monetize and we see that as an area of growth that will show up over the next several years. So I would stay tuned and we look forward to having exciting news as our experiments get to the marketplace and yield results.\nOperator: One moment before our next question. Our next question comes from Matthew Thornton with Truist. Your line is open.\nMatthew Thornton: Must be a busy morning. I didn\u2019t think I get a second question in here. Eric. The right way to think about streaming growth just to put a fine point on this. You guys reported 9.2% constant currency extra to DSP items. You have some Russia headwind. You had some slight slippage that you talked about and then probably most pronounced you have the ad supported pressure. Is it those three items that kind of bridge you up into that healthy double digit growth? I want to make sure I\u2019m understanding that the bridge commentary correctly and then maybe one for Steve. Steve in this tougher macro higher interest rates how do you think about deal activity whether it\u2019s small.\nSteve Cooper: So again with our discipline remaining as a focal point I would expect our activity to continue to be quite active.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nBen Swinburne: Hello this is Ben. Can you hear me?\nSteve Cooper: We can hear you Ben.\nBen Swinburne: Hey, guys. I didn\u2019t hear the last like eight minutes. So this could be repetitive. I apologize. I was hearing nothing. But anyway, Eric a couple things. One, anyway to help us think about currency in the fourth quarter as relates to revenue, but also margin. I think there\u2019s a similar mismatch on OpEx and revenue on the currency front we should be thinking about. You mentioned 50% to 60%, cash flow conversion. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to be there this year, just based on the nine months. I know you said strong Q4, but do you think \u201823 you could be back in that in that zone. And then I know we talked about it a lot already on the emerging streaming. But I think part of the attraction to your business and your stock is the idea that over time, there\u2019s more consumption of music, which drives more revenue for your company. Is that. do you have any, what\u2019s your visibility in this emerging streaming bucket overall? I don\u2019t a lot of different deals. But as you look out over the next year or two, does that start to play out more obviously, to all of us that we\u2019re seeing consumption growth? And then revenue growth? Or is it still too early to really make that call? Thank you.\nEric Levin: Thanks, Ben. So on currency, a few things. So looking Q4 which I think is your question. I think nothing indicates that there\u2019s going to be much difference from Q4 and Q3 it\u2019s still going to have a similar headwind in Q4. As we convert to a strengthening dollar. The margin impact continues to flow through pretty organically. A fair amount of our costs are in local dollars, but some of our repertoires, international repertoire that\u2019s sent around the world. So there is an impact on margin as well. I will say that we do hedge against the U.S. dollar against the nine most major currencies that we work against, that doesn\u2019t necessarily flow through OIBDA but when there\u2019s a negative currency impact affecting our business on a cash basis, we have hedged operating cash flows and do get a benefit there. So we\u2019ll continue to manage to hedge currency impact. And obviously, when there\u2019s a negative currency impact on our operations, we also have roughly a billion dollars worth of Euro notes that there\u2019s a favorable impact is that becomes less expensive. That\u2019s one. Two is on the 50% to 60% conversion the first half of \u201822, we spent a significant amount on A&R, we see the flow of the second half of the year being more moderate in investments and more favorable and working capital and a significant improvement in the second half of the year. We are now in deep into evaluating fiscal \u201823. And we do evaluate and look at our cash generation and cash conversion as part of the modeling and we look at how we can achieve our goals in there, but also look at the growth opportunities investments. So we\u2019re looking at that right now. In fiscal \u201822, when we talk about cash conversion, I would say that we do expect to hit the low end of the cash conversion range that we\u2019ve discussed as we do have favorable working capital impacts coming up not just in Q3 but also in Q4. On emerging streaming. It is clear that that is growing and growing in a variety of different ways. The number of licenses, which is now measured in the hundreds is growing on a fairly regular basis. We\u2019ve already talked about the new Meta deal and other deals that we\u2019re adding in Q4. There are new categories coming online. We talked about web-3 and metaverses and those categories that really are at the very, very tip of developing product models and monetizing. We see this as an area with which we\u2019ll have continued consumption growth as new digital products and platforms are evolving all the time driving experimentation, consumer usage, consumption, the more integration of music in really what feels like a ubiquitous way with other forms of content in a blended way, all of which require music licenses. So we expect to continue to see consumption and revenue of emerging streaming growing. It won\u2019t necessarily be linear as we\u2019ve said. It\u2019s both tied to the timing of renewals, development of new products and new product platforms. And we expect those to be building up over time. And we continue to be innovative leaning in being an early adopter, being early partner with some of these companies, helping them develop their products that integrate music in thoughtful ways that can turn on fans. And so we\u2019re really excited about the opportunities there. And we expect to see continued growth for years and years to come.\nOperator: And I\u2019m not showing any further questions at this time. I\u2019ll turn the call over to Steve Cooper for any closing remarks.\nSteve Cooper: Again, thanks, everyone for joining us. We appreciate your ongoing interest in support of Warner Music. I hope everybody has a wonderful wrap up to this summer and a very safe Labor Day. Stay well everyone. We\u2019ll talk to you soon. Bye, bye.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Eric Levin",
            "content": "Thanks. Thank you, Steven. Good morning, everyone. Our Q3 results reflect the inherent resilience of our business that comes from our diverse portfolio of revenue streams. Even in a quarter where ad supported streaming revenue came under pressure due to macro trends, we still grew most of our revenue lines and saw significant growth in operating and free cash flow. Total revenue increased by over 12% on a constant currency basis reflecting growth in both recorded music and music publishing. Total company streaming revenue increased 6.5% driven by growth across both segments. Adjusted for the onetime items that I will describe in a moment, total revenue and streaming growth were 14.9% and 10.3% respectively. Companywide streaming revenue from emerging platforms was sequentially flat at $345 million on an annualized basis. As Steve mentioned, this revenue will increase in Q4 driven by new deals with platforms including our recently signed deals with Meta. Adjusted OIBDA declined 3% with margins of 17.8% compared to 19.6% in the prior year quarter. On a constant currency basis adjusted OIBDA increased 2.4%. That decline in margin was primarily due to revenue mix, driven by the growth and lower margin artist's services revenue, and the impact of exchange rates. The impact to adjusted OIBDA growth and margins was magnified by the reduction in streaming revenue, which was primarily driven by onetime items. Normalizing for these items consolidated adjusted over OIBDA on a constant currency basis grew 13% and margins would have declined by only 40 basis points. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 6.7% with margins declining from 21% to 18.4% due to the same factors that impacted adjusted OIBDA. Recorded music revenue grew 8.5%, driven by growth across all revenue lines. Streaming revenue increased by 3%, compared to a very strong prior year quarter that saw impressive growth of 27%. Our prior year quarter performance was driven by outsize growth and ad supported streaming revenue that was recovering from COVID, new deals with emerging streaming platforms, and some especially successful releases. By comparison, our streaming growth in Q3, 22 was more muted, due to deceleration and ad supported streaming revenue driven by the challenging macro environment, and shifts in the timing of new releases. Normalized subscription streaming revenue grew in low double digits in line with the market. However, ad supported streaming growth, which had been trending in the high teens fell into the low single digits in Q3. Additionally, there were several previously disclosed items that impacted comparability for the quarter. A new deal with one of our digital partners which commenced in Q1 created a $34 million Q3 headwind and an $11 million benefit in the prior year quarter due to a catch up payment related to one of our digital partners. Adjusting for the impact of these onetime items, recorded music total revenue, and streaming revenue grew 13.1% and 9.2% respectively. While the macro challenges to ad supported streaming revenue may persist for some time, we expect streaming growth to improve for us in Q4 bolstered by robust release schedule, a less challenging prior year comparison, and new deals with emerging streaming platforms. Artist services and expanded REITs revenue growth accelerated and increased by 56% primarily reflecting a boost in concert promotion revenue as touring activity returned. Physical revenue grew by 2%, primarily driven by strong performance in Asia. Licensing revenue increased 9%, mainly due to higher synchronization revenue led by the U.S. and UK. Adjusted OIBDA decreased 9% on an as reported basis, and 4% on a constant currency basis. Adjusted OIBDA margin declined from 22% in the prior year quarter to 19.4%, primarily due to revenue mix. Normalizing for the onetime items described above adjusted OIBDA grew 7% on a constant currency basis, and the year-over-year margin declined would have only been 100 basis points. Music publishing continues to deliver impressive results, posting 35% year-over-year growth. Digital revenue grew 32%, reflecting continued momentum in streaming, which increased 35% and was driven by strength across traditional and emerging streaming platforms. Additionally, digital revenue growth reflected a $17 million benefit resulting from the July 1 decision by the U.S. Copyright Royalty Board and Phonorecords III which Steve mentioned earlier. Adjusted for the benefit from this decision, digital revenue increased 16.5% and streaming revenue increased by 18.3%. Performance revenue increased by 80% as bars, restaurants, concerts and live events continued to recover from COVID disruption. We saw a rebound in Germany, UK, France, and the US sync revenue increased by over 20% due to higher television and commercial licensing activity. Mechanical revenue declined slightly. Music publishing adjusted OIBDA increase 30% to $57 million while margin remained flat at 23%. On a constant currency basis adjusted OIBDA increased 33%. Normalizing for the impact of the CRB rate benefit adjusted OIBDA would have increased 23% on a constant currency basis and margin would have been essentially flat. In line with our expectations, Q3 CapEx increased to $35 million as compared to 20 million in the prior year quarter, mainly due to IT, investments in IT infrastructure, and expansion of our EMP facilities. As a reminder, our financial transformation is expected to deliver annualized run rate savings of $35 million to $40 million once fully implemented. Operating and free cash flow growth in Q3 were very strong. Operating cash flow increased 79% to $163 million from 91 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was largely driven by the timing of A&R investment. Free cash flow increased 80% to $128 million from 71 million in the prior year quarter. We expect strong cash flow generation in Q4 as well driven by the timing of deals that will be favorable to working capital. As of June 30, we had a cash balance of $345 million, total debt of 3.8 billion and net debt of 3.4 billion. Our weighted average cost of debt is 3.4% and our nearest maturity date is 2028. Before we conclude our call, I want to mention that we recently settled a number of copyright infringement cases that will impact our Q4 results. We expect that the proceeds from these settlements after netting litigation expenses, and artist and songwriter royalties will have an estimated favorable impact to consolidated OIBDA of at least $25 million. We are closely monitoring the rapidly changing macro environment and we'll adapt as we always have. We have full conviction and music's resilience and will aggressively pursue new opportunities for artists and songwriters even during market dislocations. The fourth quarter is off to a strong start with our new releases performing well and new deals with emerging streaming platforms. We are on an upward trajectory and are positioning ourselves to take advantage of the opportunities for growth that lie ahead. Thank you for joining our call today. And we will now open the call for questions. Those three questions and reading notes really fast. Okay. So three things. So adjusted OIBDA free cash flow. So one thing I would encourage there generally our free cash flow to adjusted OIBDA conversion has been 50%, 60%. We think that's a reasonable range to operate and every quarter will be different. The timing of spend on A&R is going to vary based on deal activity and really challenging to look at quarter-to-quarter. A larger period of time, year-to-year, for example, is a better period, the 50% to 60% has been a place we've been comfortable operating in. We think that's a fair place to look. I will make the comment though, that we look at our waterfall of how to deploy excess cash. And the first stop at our waterfall is redeploying it into the business to drive future growth. We have grown our market share. If you look at over the past several years, call it a five year period. And one of the ways we do that is by redeploying our operating cash flow back in the business with accretive deals to drive growth. But fundamentally we are driving to drive our operating and free cash flow in line with OIBDA with call it a 50%,, 60% conversion rate. But we then use our waterfall beyond that. Second question. So we had made an investment in the business and had accrued about 10 million towards an earn out that was part of the acquisition if certain metrics were achieved. Given the slowdown in the ad supported market, we no longer forecast that earn out will be achieved and reversed a $10 million accrual on the timing of deals. The one deal we called out here is the Meta deal, which we closed in Q4 and that will be reflected in our Q4 results. We do expect our emerging streaming revenue in our streaming revenue because of that, because of the timing of new emerging streaming deals to have a positive bump in Q4. We were still in the process of driving Q4 and we don't quantify individual deals. So I can't give you a number but we do expect that to have positive impact. Thank you, Matthew. So I'll start so and thank you, Michael, for the questions. So there was a few substantive releases that have slipped from Q3 to Q4. I will focus a little bit on Q4. We feeling very good about Q4 overall, for the reasons we talked about on the release schedule. Lizzo, who already has a number one hit the album coming out and in Q4 special Cardi B has an album coming out Panic at the Disco, Paulo Londra and several other significant international artists are Q4 release schedule, we think is really set up nicely. And certainly we do see that as being an accelerator versus Q3. In addition to a strong release schedule, the close of several emerging streaming deals, including Meta will be a positive. And we also mentioned that there were several legal settlements in Q4 that will bring approximately 25 million of OBIDA into Q4. So there's a series of positive news in Q4 that we have already delivered. And that will be impacting the results throughout the remainder of the quarter. On ad supported part of the slowdown was the market. You could look at the results of some of our largest distributors, and see the rate of which they're slowed down that affects our business. But again, our job is to maximize the performance of that area with releases and great marketing campaigns. And we're thrilled that the largest part the lion's share of our subscription revenue of our streaming revenue, which is subscriptions, continues to grow solidly in the double digits. Thanks, Ben. So on currency, a few things. So looking Q4 which I think is your question. I think nothing indicates that there's going to be much difference from Q4 and Q3 it's still going to have a similar headwind in Q4. As we convert to a strengthening dollar. The margin impact continues to flow through pretty organically. A fair amount of our costs are in local dollars, but some of our repertoires, international repertoire that's sent around the world. So there is an impact on margin as well. I will say that we do hedge against the U.S. dollar against the nine most major currencies that we work against, that doesn't necessarily flow through OIBDA but when there's a negative currency impact affecting our business on a cash basis, we have hedged operating cash flows and do get a benefit there. So we'll continue to manage to hedge currency impact. And obviously, when there's a negative currency impact on our operations, we also have roughly a billion dollars worth of Euro notes that there's a favorable impact is that becomes less expensive. That's one. Two is on the 50% to 60% conversion the first half of \u201822, we spent a significant amount on A&R, we see the flow of the second half of the year being more moderate in investments and more favorable and working capital and a significant improvement in the second half of the year. We are now in deep into evaluating fiscal \u201823. And we do evaluate and look at our cash generation and cash conversion as part of the modeling and we look at how we can achieve our goals in there, but also look at the growth opportunities investments. So we're looking at that right now. In fiscal \u201822, when we talk about cash conversion, I would say that we do expect to hit the low end of the cash conversion range that we've discussed as we do have favorable working capital impacts coming up not just in Q3 but also in Q4. On emerging streaming. It is clear that that is growing and growing in a variety of different ways. The number of licenses, which is now measured in the hundreds is growing on a fairly regular basis. We've already talked about the new Meta deal and other deals that we're adding in Q4. There are new categories coming online. We talked about web-3 and metaverses and those categories that really are at the very, very tip of developing product models and monetizing. We see this as an area with which we'll have continued consumption growth as new digital products and platforms are evolving all the time driving experimentation, consumer usage, consumption, the more integration of music in really what feels like a ubiquitous way with other forms of content in a blended way, all of which require music licenses. So we expect to continue to see consumption and revenue of emerging streaming growing. It won't necessarily be linear as we've said. It's both tied to the timing of renewals, development of new products and new product platforms. And we expect those to be building up over time. And we continue to be innovative leaning in being an early adopter, being early partner with some of these companies, helping them develop their products that integrate music in thoughtful ways that can turn on fans. And so we're really excited about the opportunities there. And we expect to see continued growth for years and years to come."

            "name": "Steve Cooper",
            "content": "Thanks, Kareem. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Given these turbulent times, I'd like to start by reaffirming why we're so positive about WMG's future. As the pandemic proved, music is an essential need for humanity. This need has and will continue to make the music sector more resilient than many other industries. Streaming, our largest revenue source has a long runway, and there's substantial headroom for both subscriber growth and subscription fee increases. We continue to see an explosion of new opportunities in sync, social media, gaming and NFTs, as well as the resurgence of vinyl sales and the bounce back in touring related revenue. Over the long term, we're no longer reliant on any single format. Today, music propels and monetizes across every form of entertainment. In the digital age, artists have more ways than ever to engage and excite fans, which magnifies the importance and value of music companies such as ours. Against this backdrop, we're uniquely positioned for long term success. We have the scale, skill set and agility to best capitalize on trends and artists development and drive the globalization and diversification of our business. It's from this position of strength that we want to be clear about some challenges that we encountered in Q3. We've had to deal with very, very significant FX headwinds, as we report in Dollars, not Euros or Yen. The slippage of a number of key album releases into Q4 macro advertising trends resulting in a slowdown in ad supported revenue, and the ongoing suspension of our Russian operations. In addition, our reported results were impacted by several previously disclosed onetime items that affect year-over-year comparisons. These include the deal renewal with one of our digital partners, which affect all four quarters of this fiscal year, but not beyond, and the benefit in the prior year quarter from the catch-up payment related to another of our digital partners. As always, our goal is to help you reconcile reported results to underlying performance. We're committed to making sure that these items are more clearly understood in the future. Eric will go into more detail about our normalized numbers shortly. So on to our results. Total revenue in the quarter was over 1.4 billion. This represents year-over-year 7% and 12% on an as reported in constant currency basis compared against an incredibly strong Q3 in 2021. Adjusted EBITDA declined 6.7% to 263 million with a margin of 18.4% compared to 21% in the prior year quarter. The year-over-year adjusted EBITDA decline was driven primarily by FX headwinds. The margin decline was impacted by the strong resurgence of our lower margin artists' services offerings. In recorded music, our revenue was approximately 1.19 billion, an increase of 8.5% from the prior year quarter with streaming revenue up 2.7%. As I mentioned, factors such as ad supported streaming weakness impacted these results. However, these percentage increases do not accurately reflect the true strength of our streaming business. Normalizing for the previously discussed onetime items recorded music streaming revenue grew by 9.2%. Artist services continued to show impressive recovery with revenue growth of 55.7% while licensing was up 8.7% and Physical was up approximately 2%. Publishing had a very strong quarter with revenues of $245 million approximately 35% more than the prior year quarter. I'd like to note, we expect an uplift in our Q4 recorded music streaming revenue, driven by a very strong release slate, including new music from Cardi B, Lizzo. Hanukkah Disco, Argentina's Paulo Londra, Nigeria's CK and South Korea's Aespa. In addition, we have recently signed new deals with Metta that will deliver additional revenue in Q4. Our new deals include an expanded revenue sharing model that will open up additional opportunities for both frontline and catalog artists. With that in mind, I'd like to spend the rest of my remarks today picking up on the theme of why we're so confident about our future. Many of you have heard me talk before about the key pillars of our long term strategy; music, globalization, innovation, and people. I'd like to explain how we're distinguishing ourselves in each of these areas, and talk a bit about our ambitions. As always, let's start with the music. We often get asked whether all the major music companies are just tracking the same data and chasing the same artists. If you look at our biggest stars, you can see that that's not true for us. Long term artists development has been a hallmark of WMC for decades, with stars like Madonna, Joni Mitchell and Fleetwood Mac among many others. Today, we remain absolutely committed to backing originality. Ed Sheeran, Cardi B, Anita, Dua, Lippa, Bruno Mars and others are all extraordinary artists that were signed to our labels very early in their careers. It should be noted that last month, Ed Sheeran became the first artist to hit 100 million followers on Spotify. Q3 saw the return of Lizzo one of our most talented new superstars. Her Monster hit About Damn Time achieved number one status in U.S. while reaching the top three in Australia, Belgium, Canada, New Zealand and the UK. Released last month her claim new album Special hit the top 10 in key markets, including the U.S., UK, Canada and Australia. The sophisticated multi platform campaign behind Lizzo's new release is a great example of what's possible when a true original is backed by our creative global team. By way of example, in April Lizzo made her debut in the Metaverse by performing a song breaker, the first music award show on Roblox. In July, she celebrated her album release with an exclusive live show experience in concert in New York, sponsored by American Express and live streamed on Twitch. In the fall, a documentary about Lizzo's life is coming to HBO Max. The film is co-produced by Warner Music Entertainment and Atlantic films. Around the world, we've had a string of smashes from some of our most exciting international stars, including Nigeria's Burna Boy, Japan's Tatsuro Yamashita, and the UK's LF System. Back in the U.S., Jack Harlow celebrated his first solo single number one, while the Red Hot Chili Peppers 12th studio album debuted at number one in the U.S., the UK, Germany, and 13 other markets around the world. We also helped propel the explosive success of Kate Bush's Running up that hill in the new season of Netflix Stranger Things. Originally released in 1985, the song returned to number one on Billboard's global 200 and Spotify his daily global charts. This is a great example of the Evergreen power of unique songs and recordings, as well as further proof that there are no barriers in the modern music business. Irrespective of genre, geography or generation a hit can emerge and reemerge from anywhere from anyone at any time. Meanwhile, our publishing arm Warner Chappell is really humming. Our songwriters scored 86 songs on the Billboard Hot 100 in Q3. Our Nashville team was named Billboard's Top Country Music publisher for an unprecedented 21 consecutive quarters. Culture shifting songwriters, welcome to Warner Chappell this quarter include dope, who co-produced Drake's way to sexy, Puerto Rican rapper [Indiscernible] an influential figure in the queer Latin rap scene, and Tyson Yoshi, one of Hong Kong's top hip hop singer songwriters and independent artists. We also signed a wide ranging partnership with Hollywood star and popular comedian, Kevin Hart and his media company Heartbeat. We're administering all of heartbeat songs covering past and future works for film, TV, gaming, and Web-3. Our shift to becoming a truly global music enterprise continues to pay off. We've taken a two pronged approach, growing our local expertise and talent while making targeted investments and forging partnerships with local best in class operators. A case in point, back in 2014, we were first movers in China taking two important steps that year, we acquired one of the largest independent catalogues, Gold Typhoon, and we were the first major music entertainment company to strike a wide ranging partnership with Tencent. In 2014, China was the 19th ranked music market in the world. Last year, it was in sixth position and climbing. Deals made a number of years ago have been critical to us being in the pole position to capitalize on continued growth in China where our revenue is 7x what it was in 2014. We continue to spot the markets that are going to ignite and deploy a bespoke strategy for each one. We've spoken to you in the past about the launch of Warner Music in India, and organic growth market share in Brazil. More recently, we've transacted with [Indiscernible] and Rotana in the Middle East, and Chocolate City and Africa, Korea and Nigeria and across Africa. This quarter, we launched Warner Music in Israel, which is a fast growing market with real global potential. Our roster there already includes superstars, Noah Carell, and Noga Rez. And we have some exciting plans to further turbocharge our growth in this market. As a company that thrives at the intersection of art and tech, our commitment to innovation is helping us create a bright future for our artists, our songwriters and ourselves. We're constantly experimenting with ways to improve, expand and diversify our revenue streams. Last month, we became the first major music entertainment company to adopt SoundCloud span powered royalties model, which pays artists based on individual users streaming habits. This quarter, our in house podcast network presents added shows to our portfolio such as the acclaimed series rap radar, and the Webby nominated Holding court. At the same time, we've established a reputation is the company to come to first, if you want to do anything really groundbreaking in music. We continue to harness the tools, tech, and protocols that collectively make up web-3 by constantly learning and evolving, we are simultaneously strengthening our role as the connective tissue between fans and artists by unlocking new opportunities in these rapidly changing environments. Here are just a few examples of our many recent initiatives. Two of our artists, Jason Derulo and [Indiscernible] teamed up with terror zero to recreate real life landmarks on the virtual platform decentraland. This partnership helped us expand our horizons across multiple Metaverse worlds, and tap into new promotional avenues. Warner records UK partnered with Bose to offer a first of its kind NFT collection called Stickman toys. Using a custom built algorithm visual art was mapped to audio stems creating a set of unique collectible characters. Stickman toys has been extremely successful peeking at number two on OpenSea the world's largest NFT marketplace. And finally, through our participation in a funding round for authentic artists, we're helping to redefine communal music experiences for the Metaverse. Authentic artists is an industry leading music platform powering virtual artists, digital collectibles and interactive music experiences using cutting edge AI. Before I move on, I'd like to mention that we were pleased by the July 1 remand decision by the U.S Copyright Royalty Board or CRB in Phonorecords II which covers streaming royalties for the 2018 to 2022 periods. After long drawn out appeals process, streaming services are finally being required to pay songwriters and publishers, the percentage of revenue rates that were set by the CRB in February 2019. These rates escalate annually from 11.4% in 2018, to 15.1% in 2022. This marks a hard one increase from the 10.5% rate previously set by the CRB for 2017 in Phonorecords II since many digital services we're continuing to pay songwriters and publishers at that 10.5% rate during the appeals process, the remand decision will require them to make significant retroactive payments. It's an important step in the fight for fair compensation for songwriters. Before I talk a bit about our people, I want to honor Mo Austin, the legendary former chairman and CEO of Warner Brothers Records. On August 1, we announced that Mo had passed away peacefully at 95. There was an unbelievable outpouring of loving tributes from across the entire spectrum of artists and executives, who had been part of our industry for decades. Mo was one of the greatest music executives ever. He was a driving force in shaping the Warner Music Group as we know it today. He will be hugely missed, and our deepest condolences go out through his family. I'll now give a few brief updates about our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion and the ways our people are impacting local communities. First, we're reinforcing our unique company culture through state of the art headquarters in different territories. The latest example is our music station in Madrid. A creative hub housed in a renovated train station originally built in 1861. This facility and courts recording studios, a content creation lab and a live music venue. Providing round the clock access to spaces like this not only helps us attract and retain talented executives, artists and songwriters, but also fosters creativity and collaboration in a post-COVID world. Second, our Warner Music Group Blavatnik family Foundation's social justice fund announced its fourth tranche of grantees this quarter, and held its first grantee convening event. 56 leaders from 26 organizations came together to advance social reform across the arts, education and criminal justice. Third, 300 Entertainment and Atlantic Records are leading the fight to prohibit prosecutors in the U.S. from using rap lyrics as confessional evidence in criminal trials. We're supporting the project Black initiative, whose mission is to end these racially discriminatory attacks on creative expression. Finally, in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, our priority is keeping our people safe. We believe that everyone has the right to control their reproductive health. To that end, we've expanded our health care services including financial and legal support, so our employees can exercise that right no matter where they live. In addition, we've matched employee donations supporting the important work of the Center for Reproductive Rights. To wrap up, I know that in this current macroeconomic climate, everyone is being inundated with information about short term trends. But while we're very focused on consistently delivering quarterly results, that's not the primary lens through which we look at our business. Over the past five years, we've grown revenue by 63% on an as reported basis, and adjusted EBITDA of by almost 100%, while generating about 2.5 billion of operating cash flow. In this industry, real success and real returns come from taking the long term view. It's about setting the right trajectory that will take us to new heights. We believe that the Warner Music Group is absolutely on the right path. And we look forward to keeping you updated as we continue to build tomorrow's story. With that, I'll turn it over to Eric. Yes. Sebastiana thank you so much. So we don't have, we disclosed the one time. Sebastiana thank you so much. So we don't have we, we disclosed the onetime items, we don't have anything next quarter that we are, that we see that is meaningful, that will affect the comparison. We do look forward to 2023 when we will last the anniversary of the DSP renewal that has been creating challenging comparisons for the four quarters of fiscal \u201822. But fundamentally, even though there's a challenging macro environment, we are very confident in the resilience of music and the effectiveness of Warner Music strategy. We have a strong release schedule for Q4 and are looking forward to further strong releases throughout fiscal \u201823. We see subscription streaming growth continuing to grow double digits, despite what's happening in the macro environment. Sync continues to grow. Artists services and recorded music is now back to where it was pre-COVID, which obviously is low margin revenue, but delivers revenue and OIBDA and provides a value added services for artists that we always look forward to providing them as part of our relationship. Warner Chappell has been going full guns. Their growth every quarter this year has been 20 plus percent. The recovery of performance has allowed their stellar growth in areas like streaming and sync to shine through. So we feel really good about our underlying business model, we feel really good about the resilience of music and our positioning for continued growth. I don't want to short sell that it's a challenging environment, we've seen this quarter the impact on ad supported. We continue to make sure we do everything we can to support each line of revenue growth. But FX and ad supported revenue both had challenges this quarter. And we'll continue to manage them as best as we can. Fortunately, ad supported is a minority of our streaming revenue, and therefore is a contained portion of our revenue. And the larger portion of our revenue is continuing in strong growth mode. So hopefully that gives you a summary. And thank you for your questions Sebastiana. Thank you for that. So one of the things we've been saying, quite frankly, for the past couple of years, is when artists service recovered because it was so, it was basically put on hiatus for the first two years of COVID that when it started to recover, and it would have an effect on margins downward. But we didn't know exactly how much because we didn't know if artist services recover over two years or recover fully in one year. Artist services is now back to the revenue levels that it was pre-COVID. So it's really fully recovered in a very, very short period of time. What this does is put margin, downward margin pressure in 2022 but will then create comparisons for 2023, where we've got artist services fully baked in \u201822 compared to \u201823. So we expect to get back on our margin growth trajectory, as we have comparisons that are going to be more favorable with the fully recovered artist services in both the numerator and denominator. So we feel very good about the fundamental margin growth program that we have in place growing our high margin digital revenue streams, managing costs, including our financial transformation, other technology initiatives that are in place to drive efficiency. So we feel very good about our margin growth trajectory. Our financial transformation program remains on track to launch in fiscal \u201823. We expect the benefits to start to roll in \u201823 and \u201824 until it's fully rolled out and complete. I will say that the rollout of the financial transformation is always tied to meeting very specific and detailed standards that allow us to complete our statutory management reporting, essentially perfectly. We are very close to that point. But there is work to do till we crossed dot every I and cross every T. And we're working diligently to get there. And we fully expect to launch the program at \u201823. So sure. Let me jump in on that. So thanks for the question. So first thing I'd say is that subscription streaming growth still remains quite strong remains in the double digits. In the short term, we see that as being very strong sign despite a macro environment. Long term, we think subscription streaming growth has tremendous upside potential in front of it. Developed markets are roughly 30% penetrated in aggregate. We've seen both research studies, but also market forecasts that showed that growing into the 50s or even 60s percent over time. Emerging markets are still penetrated in the mid single digits and are starting to show real improved growth. And we see enormous opportunity for emerging markets coming online with subscription streaming. The price per subscriber is still very low. We see real ARPU opportunity and Spotify and Amazon that have done forms of price increases, I think, have proven to the market that it doesn't have an impact on churn and that price increases are really available for distributors who are very excited about subscriber growth opportunities. We did see an ad supported slowdown. You've seen that in some of the companies that are distributors that reported lower ad supported growth. Clearly it was a difficult comp versus a year ago. A year ago, we had 27% streaming growth and ad supported growth was even faster than our average total streaming growth because of the recovery from COVID. But we do think the macro environment has had an impact on ad supported businesses and we'll continue to monitor to that. Again ad supported streaming is in the mid to high teens overall streaming so it's part of our business and the much larger part of our business continues streaming business continues to grow double digits. But that is something that we'll continue to monitor. Again, we have great confidence in the long term potential up streaming, we think it's just getting started, we think the emerging streaming side continues to increase in the number of licenses. We've just concluded our new Meta deal the opportunities of web-3, NFTs communities, we think is just at the very, very early experimentation phase and has significant potential, that we're focused on developing the business models to be able to monetize. So we're excited as we look forward about the growth in streaming. In the short term we're navigating tough macros, but still think the resilience of music and streaming gives us real opportunities to continue the growth vectors. Thanks Kutgun. So on streaming, rough ballpark, the mix of the components subscriber ad support and emerging is roughly 70, 20, 10 in the high teens 10. So think of subscriber as the 70% ad supported is the high, very high teens and emerging being the rest call it roughly 10. There are some cats and dogs in there like digital radio and things like that. But those are relatively small compared to the bigger pie. Your other question on emerging streaming and the growth components and the trending going forward. There's a few components to that. Obviously, as you stated Kutgun the renewals are a meaningful part of that, when you have a few deals that have become relatively scaled in there, it becomes meaningful when those are renewed. We don't talk specifically to the renewal timing of individual deals, obviously, Meta is a meaningful one. We usually do two to three year deals. We had a slew of renewals roughly a year ago, that were actually reflected in our Q3, \u201821 results. So there will be some deals that come up in \u201823. And we will see that in next year's results. What I will also say is it's not just about renewals, it's also about new vectors of growth. We look at areas like Web-3 with NFTs and the ability to build interactive communities as having huge potential. But the platforms and products that develop sustainable business models that really excite fans, and monetize and connect fans and artists in ways that are the deep, rich, and exciting dynamic communities is something that is being experimented with develop. We're working very closely with a series of partners when we've talked about the different deals that we've done over the past year or so with best in class partners in NFTs and building out nods with roadblocks and others that is all with an eye towards developing a model for music in this new world that can monetize and we see that as an area of growth that will show up over the next several years. So I would stay tuned and we look forward to having exciting news as our experiments get to the marketplace and yield results. So again with our discipline remaining as a focal point I would expect our activity to continue to be quite active. We can hear you Ben. Again, thanks, everyone for joining us. We appreciate your ongoing interest in support of Warner Music. I hope everybody has a wonderful wrap up to this summer and a very safe Labor Day. Stay well everyone. We'll talk to you soon. Bye, bye."

And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve.\nSteve Cooper: Thanks, Kareem. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As we approach the two-year anniversary of our IPO, I'd like to reflect for a moment on the key pillars of our success. These are the fundamentals of our strategy, the principles we bear in mind when charting our course into the future. First, of course, is the music. It's at the heart of everything we do. While taste, trends and tech are ever-changing, our artists and songwriters will always be our driving force. Second is our global growth. About a decade ago, we set a goal to become a global music entertainment company through the expansion of our local expertise. Today, I'll share the progress we're making in growing our presence around the world. Third, we're a company that thrives at the intersection of art and technology. Innovation and data-driven insights are helping us actively create our future. And fourth, our people and our commitment to making our company a place where the best individual talents can be long and build a career. But first, let's get into our Q2 results. I'm pleased to say that they reflect the strong health of our streaming revenue, continued growth in publishing and recovery from COVID in artist services and performance. Total revenue in the quarter was almost $1.4 billion. This represents year-over-year growth of 10% and 13% on an as-reported and constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA was $282 million with a margin of 20.5%, compared to 21.4% in the prior year quarter. This decline was driven by our revenue mix. As our lower-margin revenue streams recovered from COVID, they became bigger contributors to overall revenue. We continue to expect that we'll achieve our long-term margin targets in the next several years as mix and growth rates normalize. In recorded music, our revenue was approximately $1.15 billion, an increase of 11.4% from the prior year quarter, with streaming revenue growing 10%. Normalizing for the impact of the new digital deal that we discussed on our Q1 earnings call, recorded music total revenue and streaming revenue both grew by 15%. artist services and physical continue to show impressive recovery with revenue growth of 25% and 8%, respectively. Licensing revenue powered by sync grew 23%. In publishing, we delivered revenue of $230 million, 23% more than the prior year quarter, driven by growth across all revenue lines. Company-wide streaming revenue from emerging platforms grew to $345 million on an annualized basis, up from $325 million in Q1. And now on to the music. An important differentiator for the Warner Music Group is our focus on long-term artist development. These days, there's a misconception that all music majors are just following the same data and chasing artists who already have a significant presence in the market. That's not quite true for us. First and foremost, we seek out originality. When we identify really great artists and songwriters, we collaborate with them to ensure that they have the opportunity to realize their full potential. Most of our biggest superstars were signed to one of our labels at the very beginning of their careers. This commitment to extraordinary talent is something that has distinguished us for decades. Legendary voices like Aretha Franklin and Fleetwood Mac have now been joined by visionary performers like Lizzo and Ed Sheeran. The impact of our unique irreplaceable catalog in music will reverberate for generations. At this year's Grammys, Silk Sonic, the R&B super-duo of Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak took home the highly coveted Record of the Year and Song of the Year awards, plus two more. Bruno has now won Record of the Year 3 times, a feat previously accomplished only by Paul Simon. Without question, he now ranks as one of the world's greatest entertainers. We're always developing the next wave of culture shaping music that will create the sound track of tomorrow. For example, Gayle kicked off the year with number one worldwide Smash ABCDEFU and Jack Harlow's new single First Class debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 last month. Dua Lipa and Megan Thee Stallion racked up over 40 million streams in just one week with their hit collaboration Sweetest Pie. Our publishing team also continues to excel with an impressive 90 songs charting on the Billboard Hot 100 over the course of Q2. Some of the biggest hits that our songwriters contributed to this quarter were Silk Sonic's Smoking Out the Window, Rauw Alejandro's Desperados and Dave's, Starlight. Warner Chappell had a superb showing at this year's Grammys. In addition to Bruno and Anderson, who are also Warner Chappell's songwriters, we saw big wins for Chris Stapleton for Best Country Song and Ojivolta for Best Rap Song. Warner Chappell is winning highly competitive deals for talent around the world and across the music spectrum. From Nigeria's, Tay Iwar to Italy's, Sick Luke to the U.S.'s, Nicolle Galyon. In March, we signed two important deals with Patrick Moxey, the Founder of Dance Label Ultra. Warner Chappell now administers Ultra\u2019s 6,000 copyrights throughout Europe, including songs from Drake, Rihanna and The Weeknd among many others. And Warner recorded music also entered into a strategic alliance with Patrick's legendary Payday Records as well as his new label, Helix. At a time, when domestic music is on the rise in most countries, we're also one of the few companies with the resources and expertise to take a truly global approach to artist development. This strategy requires a mix of organic A&R investment, partnerships with the most credible local players and financially disciplined acquisitions of catalogs and labels. Across established and emerging markets, we create the conditions for success to travel at the speed of sound. We saw a perfect example of our long-term strategy and action, when and Anitta and Paulo Londra both signed to Warner Music Latin America, took number one and number two on Spotify's global chart. With her Monster Hit, Envolver, Anitta made history as the first Brazilian to hit the top spot, while Paulo has spent five consecutive weeks at the top of Billboard's Argentina 100. According to IFPI's 2022 Global Music Report, MENA was the fastest-growing market in 2021, up 35% year-over-year. This quarter, we announced that we would be acquiring Qanawat Music, the region's largest independent distributor, which will expand our presence in this important territory. Qanawat is on the ground in Dubai, Cairo and Casablanca and offers services in more than 20 countries. Having only launched Warner Music Middle East in 2018, we moved quickly to become a leading player in this region. India is another rapidly growing market where we focused our attention and have increased our market share meaningfully in the last 24 months. We've recently partnered with some of Bollywood's biggest talents. And last month, Warner Music India entered into a strategic partnership with Jjust Music, founded by renowned Actor and Producer, Jackky Bhagnani. This will give us access to marquee Bollywood releases while Jjust Music artists will benefit from our worldwide network. In March, we partnered with Diljit Dosanjh, one of India's biggest film and music superstars. We're already working together to amplify his global career, including collaborations with Canadian rapper Tory Lanez and Tanzanian Star Diamond Platnumz. Across the globe, blockbuster albums from the likes of Red Hot Chili Peppers, Ed Sheeran and Kodak Black are showing incredible staying power. And we're excited about what's on the horizon with new music coming from stars like Lizzo, Ava Max and Cardi B, as well as our next generation of hit makers such as PinkPantheress, Bella Poarch and Tiago PZK. As the world grapples with war, inflation and other macroeconomic concerns, one thing is certain: music's ubiquity and the value have already proven to be resilient through any kind of disruption. Unlike the video streaming market, which churns as subscribers constantly search for new and different exclusive content, the music streaming market is sticky. Subscribers have access to all the music they could ever want on a single platform, and they become attached to the collections and playlists they have curated over time. And while films and TV series may come and go, devotion to one's favorite music and artist is more deep-seated and longer lasting. As new platforms emerge, it becomes increasingly clear that whatever the mode of consumption, music is the common thread that runs throughout the entire entertainment economy. We're one of the few companies with the reach, skills and capabilities to connect the dots for artists and songwriters on a global basis. We protect and promote the value of music. We help creators navigate an incredibly complex landscape, and we deepen the connection between artists and fans. As streaming continues to scale and social media provides increasingly meaningful revenue, there is now a lot of buzz about Web3. Since 2019, we've been strategically investing in tech companies that feature music prominently in their offerings. This has built our reputation as the planet's most innovative future-focused music company. These investments have fostered partnerships at the intersection of gaming, social and entertainment with brands such as Roblox, Fortnite and The Sandbox. And we formed groundbreaking relationships with innovation leaders such as Genies, Blockparty, OneOf and Dapper Labs. As a recent example, we've also partnered with blockchain gaming developers Splinterlands to give Warner Music artists the tools to develop arcade-style games such as the extremely popular DAP. The latest deal we signed was with proof of attendance protocol, POAP for short. This will enable us to mint shared memories as NFTs, giving collectors authenticated digital proof they were part of a specific experience or event. Atlantic Records' rapper, Kevin Gates, recently tapped into the technology offering fans who attended his sold-out Red Rock's concert of POAP to commemorate the show. As I mentioned earlier, we thrive at the intersection of art and technology. We were very excited to announce that Mike Shinoda, Co-Founder of the Warner Records band Linkin' Park, has been enlisted as our first-ever community innovation adviser. Mike is a music tech visionary who will be a great source of wisdom and insight as our artists bring their creative visions to life on multiple new platforms. I've talked before about our network of direct-to-consumer destinations, including UPROXX, HipHopDX, Songkick and EMP. These companies all fall under the umbrella of our newly rebranded media and content arm WMX. Last week, at our first ever New Fronts event for brands and advertisers, WMX unveiled new culture driving original programming that will roll out across these outlets later this year. These programs include: Fresh Pair with Katty Customs, a sneaker culture show co-hosted and executive produced by Just Blaze; Iconic Records, a visual podcast that will explore the legacy of Notorious B.I.G.; and Limited, a merch design competition featuring hot artists and emerging creators. WMX already ranks as a top five video company in the U.S., and this exciting roster of programming will bring advertisers new opportunities to reach young, engaged and influential audiences. The other two areas of incremental revenue I'd like to highlight today are, first, digital fitness. WMG was the music launch partner for Peloton's gaming-inspired fitness experience, Lanebreak. The first artist featured on Lanebreak were two Warner Legends, David Bowie and David Guetta. Second, podcasting. Following the success of shows like People's Party with Talib Kweli, we're continuing to build our presence in this space. Last month, we announced the launch of Interval Presents, our in-house podcast network sitting at the crossroads of music, pop culture and social impact. We already have shows in the works from Oscar-winning actress Lupita Nyong'o, and Grammy-nominated singer Jason Derulo, among other major talents. When we took the company public less than two years ago, many of these business models were only nascent. While we still have plenty of work to do, we've made great progress in a very short period. Our strategies are proving to be sound. The universe of possibilities continues to expand in every direction and will enhance the growth of an already robust music entertainment industry. IFPI reported that the global recorded music industry grew by an impressive 18.5% in 2021. We're proud to say that we outperformed this benchmark by almost 2.5 percentage points, a testament to our impact on global culture and our ability to create communities of fans across every medium. During our last call, we talked about our DEI commitments, which we unveiled as part of our first ESG report. This quarter, we announced a new initiative designed to help us achieve those objectives, our DEI Institute, the first of its kind within the music industry. It will help us tap into a wide array of external expertise as we educate our employees and implement action plans across our company. Before I hand it over to Eric, I would be remiss if I didn't talk about the situation in Ukraine. We pray that this conflict ends soon and that the people of Ukraine can live in peace. As it's done throughout history, music is playing an indispensable role in lifting spirits and giving hope during this terrible hardship. We're committed to supporting relief efforts, both for the people in Ukraine and the refugee population. This includes contributions to the Red Cross, Polish Humanitarian Action and Project Hope. As we announced in early March, we suspended operations in Russia. We're very excited about all the great new music and fresh initiatives that will be introduced through the balance of the year. We look forward to keeping you updated as we continue to build our momentum. And with that, I'll turn it over to Eric.\nEric Levin: Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. There is a lot to unpack within our Q2 results, but I will start with some high-level takeaways. Core streaming remains healthy -- remains incredibly healthy underpinned by strength in subscription streaming. All of our non-digital revenue lines continue to grow as well. While publishing is firing on all cylinders posting impressive results yet again. . Over the last several quarters, we've seen elevated levels of investments in A&R and M&A, which have obvious impacts on our cash flow. As expected, this has drawn attention from analysts, and shareholders who want to better understand how we view these investments, what the return thresholds are and how these investments will drive future growth. I will get into that in more detail shortly. Moving on to our results. Total revenue increased by over 13% on a constant currency basis reflecting double-digit growth in both recorded music and music publishing. On an as-reported basis, total revenue grew 10%. Total streaming revenue increased 12%, driven by growth across both businesses, including revenue from emerging streaming platforms. This strong operating performance translated to adjusted OIBDA growth of 7%, with margins of 19.9% compared to 20.4% in the prior year quarter. The decline in margin reflects the continued recovery in lower-margin artist services revenue, as well as the reduction in high-margin streaming revenue resulting from the impact of the new deal with one of our digital partners we discussed on our last earnings call. Adjusted EBITDA grew 5% with margins declining from 21.4% to 20.5% due to the same factors that impacted adjusted OIBDA. As a reminder, adjusted EBITDA includes the pro forma impact of future cost savings and certain specified transactions. You can find the calculations and reconciliations related to adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EBITDA in our press release. Recorded music revenue grew 11% driven by growth across all revenue lines. Streaming revenue increased 10% due to growth in traditional and emerging streaming platforms. As we mentioned, our results reflect the impact of the new deal with one of our digital partners, which began at the start of fiscal 2022. Adjusting for the impact of the new deal, which was $31 million in the quarter, our recorded music streaming revenue would have grown 15%. I want to provide a bit more granularity so that everyone understands the underlying trends within recorded music streaming. Normalizing for the impact of the new deal, subscription streaming revenue was robust in the high-teens. Comparability in our ad-supported streaming growth was impacted by a true-up payment that benefited the prior year quarter. As a result, ad-supported streaming, which generally grows in line with subscription streaming, grew in the high single digits. We fully expect to see a normalization in our recorded music streaming growth rate commencing in Q1 2023 once we lap the anniversary of the new digital deal. Artist services and expanded rights revenue grew by 25%, reflecting an increase in merchandising revenue and touring activity. Physical revenue grew by 8%, primarily driven by an increased worldwide demand for vinyl. Licensing revenue increased by 23%, mainly due to higher synchronization revenue. Adjusted OIBDA was $253 million, a 5% increase over prior year quarter. Margin declined from 22.9% in the prior year quarter to 22.1% due to revenue mix. Music publishing had another strong quarter as well, posting revenue of $230 million and a growth rate of 23%, reflecting increases across all revenue lines. Digital delivered strong revenue growth of 26%, driven by streaming growth of 23%, with strength across traditional and emerging platforms, digital benefit from the timing of new digital deals. Sync revenue increased over 28% due to higher commercial licensing activity in the quarter. Performance revenue increased by 9% as bars, restaurants, concerts and live events continue to recover from COVID disruption. And mechanical revenue increased 8%, benefiting from strong physical sales. Music publishing adjusted OIBDA increased 33% to $61 million, while margin increased 2.5 percentage points to 26.5% from 24%. As I mentioned on our last call, we still expect to see elevated full year CapEx in the range of $130 million to $135 million. In Q2, CapEx increased to $28 million as compared to $20 million in the prior year quarter, mainly due to investments in IT infrastructure and expansion of our E&P facilities. Our financial transformation program remains on track and is expected to deliver annualized run rate savings of $35 million to $40 million once fully implemented starting in fiscal year 2023. Operating cash flow decreased 71% to $44 million from $150 million. The decline was largely driven by the timing of royalty payments and other movements within working capital. Free cash flow decreased 88% to $16 million from $130 million in the prior year quarter. As of December 31, we had a cash balance of $385 million, total debt of $3.8 billion and net debt of $3.4 billion. Since our IPO, we have continued to actively manage our capital structure, further reducing our weighted average cost of debt from 4% to 3.3% and extending maturities, with our nearest maturity date now in 2028. There is no question that the optimal use of our capital is to invest alongside the music industry's tailwinds. I'd like to clarify a few points around the financial characteristics of our A&R and M&A investments. The vast majority of our A&R advances to artists and songwriters are recoupable, with royalties -- from royalties, and we recoup the overwhelming majority of them. It's just a matter of timing. Artist deals have become more expensive because music is worth more in the streaming era. We can pay more because we earn more. The overwhelming majority of our new artist deals provide us with substantial recording commitments and long-term rights. When we make M&A investments, they are typically accretive on day one, incremental to growth and financed with debt. With our M&A investments, which are sometimes for once-in-a-lifetime rights and catalogs, we have the luxury of being an opportunistic strategic buyer that can maximize the value of acquired rights through our global infrastructure. Whether investing in A&R or M&A, we rigorously analyze every transaction and have a high degree of conviction that our broad portfolio of investments will drive profitable growth and shareholder value for years to come. As we look ahead, we feel great about the health of our business and how we are positioning ourselves to take advantage of the vast opportunities for growth that lie ahead. Thank you for joining our call today, and we will now open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Benjamin Black with Deutsche. Your line is open.\nBenjamin Black: The first one is for Steve. As you mentioned, a lot has happened into your IPO between COVID, inflation, interest rates and obviously the war. So has your long-term outlook changed at all? I know the entire market has come under pressure, but your stock has actually been hit a lot harder. So what do you think the market is missing? And then perhaps one for Eric on margins. How should we be thinking about the cadence of your margin expansion over the next couple of years? I understood that some of the lower-margin revenue streams are coming back this year, and you have the drag from a new DSP deal. So should we anticipate sort of more modest margin trends this year before we see a more meaningful step-up in '23?\nSteve Cooper: All right. Thanks for your questions, Ben. I'll take the first one, which is really about the changes in the world since our IPO. I think everybody is seeing -- and is concerned about some of these situations that involve in the world today: War, inflation, rising interest rates. That being said, music has, and I believe will continue to prove its resilience because it is fundamental to human nature, whether it be in good times or bad times. I would remind everyone that at the height of the pandemic, music consumption continued to increase and new use cases emerged virtually every day. So our long-term outlook remains unchanged. And if anything, we're even more optimistic. As Eric mentioned, streaming continues to be strong, both in established and emerging markets and new opportunities are coming online all the time. Many of the emerging business models that we had talked about at the time of our IPO are now generating meaningful revenue and are growing faster than traditional revenue streams. I also believe that we're better positioned to capitalize on these opportunities because of our size and our innovative mindset. We remain committed to long-term artist development. We were early to see opportunities in emerging markets, and we continue to seek out, find and seize those opportunities. We are clearly the market leader by way of innovation. We saw it with streaming. And now as we see the Web3 space, we've moved faster and in more agile ways than our competitors. We've been the first to set precedent setting deals and we'll continue to do so. So I'm very confident despite all of the craziness and chaos in the world that music will continue to be a driving force in our lives and in business until the end of time. Hopefully, that answers your question number one, Ben.\nEric Levin: Ben, let me tackle your second question. I'll hit a few key points, and thank you for the question on margins. So first, what we're seeing is something that we fully expected. Two is our recorded music margins actually increased once you adjust for the DSP renewal. So on a fundamental operating basis we\u2019re still seeing margin growth, but yes, your question in these results, as artist services recovers it is a lower margin business. It will cause a slowing or a flattening in margin in the short term. Once artist services recovers, we fully expect to resume our margin expansion trajectory consistent with our plans at the time of the IPO and heading towards mid-20s margin. So everything we're seeing is what we expected and, operating basis, we're still very comfortable with our commitment towards margin expansion.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nBen Swinburne: I guess I was hoping, Steve or Eric or both, could give us some more color on the emerging streaming business that you mentioned grew on a run rate basis this quarter. What's happening at a high level with those deals in terms of fixed versus variable? And is there -- are there one or two areas, Steve, you would really highlight that you're particularly excited about as you look out over the next 12, 24 months? And then maybe for Eric, obviously, there's a lot of concern in the market about the economy than just sort of macro headwinds. Could you just remind us, again, at a high level, how you think about your revenue base in terms of what might be exposed to the economic cycle versus just sort of underlying growth tied to subscriptions, et cetera?\nSteve Cooper: So I'll start on the emerging streaming fix versus variable question. So it is absolutely something that we've been working with our emerging streaming partners. Note that we literally have hundreds of licenses with many different categories of products and services. So it's not a onetime thing, but we are -- and one thing just to set the table, emerging streaming platforms are generally services or products that are multimedia. Music is incorporated into the product, critically essential to their products, but it can be music paired with video, music paired with a game, music paired with graphics or some other social or fitness multimedia product. We have been encouraging and working with these partners for them to develop the systems and capabilities to report on music on a stream-by-stream, consumption-detailed basis that allows us to have truly variable deals. As they develop those capabilities, it is our intent to negotiate variable deals tied to revenue or consumption, whatever the right variable is, and we're moving towards that. In this quarter, there were no major renewals, smaller renewals, but not major renewals. So we continue to work towards that end. What I will say is it will take some time. Different companies are making different degrees of progress on developing the systems capabilities to track music on a stream-by-stream, consumption basis. So it's not going to be a moment but a process that we're working with over time. Hopefully, that answers your first question. What I will say is that we are incredibly excited about what we're seeing, and you see this focus of our partnerships on Web3-type capabilities, whether it's NFTs, avatars, games that can be installed within metaverses. We think there's an extraordinary amount of opportunity to be developed there. We want to develop long-term business models, not one-offs that come and go and can't be sustained. So we're working on a series of projects and experiments with various partners that we've talked about. And a lot of our artists are interested in exploring this field. Steve mentioned several in his talking points like Kevin Gates, so we're very excited about this as a future and new avenue of growth, and we're really working very hard to be innovators in this space. On the macro economy side, what I would say is that music is a cornerstone of people's lives. We think music is -- has the expectation -- we have the expectation it will be incredibly resilient even as macroeconomic challenges emerge. We think it's different than other forms of streaming, focusing on that for a second. In other forms of streaming, people generally have like video, multiple streaming services, each of which have different content and people can decide which one they value more than another streaming service. In audio, people generally have one streaming service they subscribe to, which is all the music aggregated in one place. We think it's a very, if you will, fairly priced, if not even low-priced, high-value service that's central to people's lives. And so we think what we've been seeing and what we expect is that it will be incredibly resilient there. And so we think music and the innovation of new digital services represents a continued growth market for music as we look forward despite macroeconomic challenges, and we've been seeing that so far. That said, we continue to monitor everything that's happening in the world and in the economy, to look at areas where we continue to get more efficient, areas where we should be focusing resources to drive the best revenue growth and value creation. And so we continue to be mindful and focused on a changing and complex world, but we're still extremely optimistic about the growth vectors of music going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kutgun Maral with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nKutgun Maral: I was hoping to dig into streaming revenue trends and your expectations for the back half of the year. Underlying growth at recorded music of 15% in Q2 was fairly healthy. I guess looking ahead, do you view the mid-teens growth rate as being sustainable? And is there a scope for a potential acceleration off of the 15%? Just for my end, looking at the different components it seems like subscription streaming revenue growth will presumably stay in the high teens range and that you just reported in Q2. Ad-supported streaming growth should maybe normalize closer to that high teens increase at subscription as well as you shift away from that true-up payment comp from last year. And perhaps there are new deals with emerging streaming platforms as well after a relatively quiet few quarters, and maybe that could help bolster overall streaming growth. So I know that you don't provide guidance, but is this the right way to think about the trajectory for the back half of the year? Or are there any other puts and takes that -- puts and takes that we should be mindful of?\nEric Levin: Thanks, Kutgun. I think that was a quite thoughtful kind of statement. Certainly, we don't give guidance. So what I would say is, this quarter, our fiscal Q2 subscription streaming continue to grow high teens, the fundamentals of that business, we see are incredibly healthy. We see penetration growth opportunities in both developed and emerging markets around the world. Spotify has had success with their price increases. Their constant currency ARPU went up 3%, I believe, in this quarter. We continue to be encouraging of others to look at pricing as an opportunity to improve economic performance of streaming. So we see streaming as being very strong, the emerging forms of streaming and what we're starting to see in Web 3.0 gives us a lot of enthusiasm as well going forward. On the ad-supported side, you're right, there was that true-up in the accounting of that this quarter that have caused it to have lower growth for this individual quarter, but the fundamentals of ad-supported streaming growth remain very healthy and we have seen and fully expect to continue to see ad-supported streaming growing in line with subscription streaming on a fundamental basis. So we feel very good about the streaming platforms, their growth and the opportunities going forward, absolutely.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Uerkwitz with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nAndrew Uerkwitz: Just -- could you talk a little bit more about the catalog environment and the impact interest rates could have there? Are there a lot of catalogs out there? Are there a lot of sellers, are there a lot of buyers? Can you just talk about the competition there and the impact of interest rates -- rising interest rates could have on sale and price to those catalogs?\nEric Levin: So Andrew, I appreciate the question. So look, there have been, and I think COVID's impact on artists' ability to tour certainly -- and low interest rates create an environment where a lot of artists were interested in exploring the sale of their catalogs. As artists are able to tour again and additional revenue streams come back to artists, and as interest rates rise, which could cause potential buyers to just analyze the math with different discount rates and come up with lower values could cause things to change over time. Obviously, interest rates are projected to go up over time. So we don't think there's a moment where either catalog values will change dramatically or artists' interest in selling will change dramatically. But over time, those changing dynamics could have changed the equation both for buyers and sellers. In the short term, we do expect more catalogs to come up for sale. We will do what we have always done, which is we analyze them on an opportunistic basis. If it's a strategic fit and well priced, we will consider doing deals, but we don't feel any pressure to do deals. We have many ways to invest capital to drive growth, both organically through M&A, launching in new markets, acquiring labels and acquiring catalogs. There's many different tools that we have, and we will continue to evaluate the market and do deals where appropriate, and work to make sure we're investing our capital with financial discipline to find the best returns for our investment and to drive the best growth profile going forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Morris with Guggenheim. Your line is open.\nMichael Morris: A couple of questions. One, Eric, you just touched on this, but I'm curious if you could expand on thoughts on the return of touring and the impact, or impacts that could have on the business. We know about the margin dynamic, but I'm thinking more like top line impact. First of all, do you think it's just kind of a return to sort of the prior environment? Or are there any reasons to think that sort of touring and in-person interactivity could be something bigger in sort of a post-COVID world? I'm also curious whether you think that the ability to have live performances can impact streaming and just kind of appetite for music, enthusiasm, et cetera. So that's the first question. And then the second question along the line of the acquisitions. As you think about the geographic expansion that you've also been embarking on and supplementing with acquisitions, what are your thoughts on expanding the footprint further from here versus where you currently stand?\nEric Levin: Sure. Just writing down, there's a lot of question, Michael. So the return of touring, certainly it will be interesting. There'll certainly be some dynamics that change around the tour. So I would expect social to be a great promoter of tours around the world, artists and labels and partners using social applications to build buzz and momentum. I would expect labels and artists to be working together to create surrounding opportunities around tours, where in the past, it be tours with merch, now it will be tours with merch, and there may be Web3 applications to create micro communities that are giving NFTs and special opportunities. And those kinds of things, I think, are going to become one experimented with in the short term, what works, what the fans really love, what do they respond to, obviously, at some level, what monetizes. So I think we'll start to see experimentation in those areas, both around the release of new music but also around tours. So I think there'll be new kind of dynamics that are explored and new norms that develop over time. For the Warner Music Group, obviously, our artist services business has a significant portion that's tied to touring. We have several concert promotion businesses in Europe, in France and Spain, for example. We have a tour merch business in the U.S. And as touring comes back as we're seeing this quarter, those revenue streams start to come back, and that's a very healthy thing. Again, they are lower margin businesses, but they are positive to overall margin. Meaning not the margin percentage, but it's incremental dollars on revenue and OIBDA. So we're thrilled they're coming back. It's an important part of the music equation, and it's healthy that artist services is recovering and show signs that obviously that the economy is starting to get back to something more normal post-COVID. On the M&A side, certainly, what we focus on when it comes to geographic expansion are the emerging markets. We have always been a company that focuses on return on investment. We have been cautious not to overinvest in emerging markets before streaming and legitimate revenue streams are able to really drive growth. When those fundamentals are in place, or are starting to come into place, we start to focus on developing our capabilities in those markets. And we've done it time and time again over and over again in the past few years, in Turkey, in the Middle East, in Vietnam before that in China, and Indonesia and Brazil and Mexico. We're now looking at a series of areas that we're really excited about. Steve mentioned MENA, Middle East, North Africa, which is the fastest-growing region in the world. I think it grew 35% or so last year. We recently acquired Qanawat, the largest music distributor throughout the Middle East. We launched an organic label, an owned and operated label in the Mid-East roughly three years ago to get the start and build relationships. We developed a partnership with Rotana, one of the largest labels throughout the Middle East. So our capabilities, our infrastructure our music that we're putting out and how we're monetizing in the Middle East is changing really rapidly. We're a significant player there. And we've got a similar mindset in Africa where we acquired Africori, where we developed a partnership with Chocolate City, one of the most significant labels in Nigeria and have been releasing great music. And CK that came out of Africa had just had a global hit earlier this year. So those are two areas in the world that we're starting to see, monetize, and we're leaning into heavily. But obviously, there's other markets in Asia, Latin America that we're continuing to lean into as well. And we're very excited about the continued globalization of music. We see it as one of the really meaningful growth vectors.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Thornton with Truist. Your line is open.\nMatthew Thornton: Steve and Eric, maybe two quick ones, if I could. You touched on touring, but I was wondering maybe if you could touch a little bit on the E&P business. Obviously, I would assume that it had some benefits during the lockdowns and pandemic. I'm curious how that's performing as we kind of have opened up and continue to open up any color there would be helpful. . And then just secondly, Eric, you talked about cash conversion effectively a little bit early. I'm just kind of wondering if there's a number we should think about as you think about conversion from adjusted OIBDA to free cash flow, again, barring any deals. Is there a way to think about what a normalized number looks like there? Any color would be great.\nEric Levin: Sure. So E&P, you're absolutely right. So E&P was a major -- I hate to say beneficiary during COVID, but that doesn't sound like a phrase that should come out of someone's mouth easily. But E&P's business grew, maybe I'll say it that way, on an accelerated basis during COVID. There were quarters we were discussing 30%-plus growth. It just had a significant pull forward as e-commerce businesses benefited from people's desire to stay home and not go in public spaces to shop or other activities. . This year, we're seeing E&P much more of level off, if you will, and that's not because we don't think this is a long-term growth business. We do. We believe very strongly in E&P. But some of the dynamics: One the pull forward of the prior year; but two, some of the supply chain disruptions in the world have created a challenge for E&P getting the products they've ordered on time, that they need, and that has caused a challenge. They have been incredible leaders in working through those challenges and getting those resolved. But that has been a challenge with many companies around the world. E&P is not divorced from that. And quite frankly, the war in Ukraine has been a challenge as well. I think the climate in parts of Europe have been much more cautious, and there's just less of an environment for people to be shopping for, kind of, lifestyle goods. So E&P continues to do fine, but its growth trajectory has definitely in the short term leveled off. But we're very excited about E&P in the longer term. We just have to get past this moment, which we will. And then on the cash side, what I would say is it's kind of two pieces. First and foremost, we're very focused on growing our business. And as our revenue and OIBDA grow, our fundamental operating cash flow, we fully expect to grow with that. However, we have a waterfall of how we deploy our capital. The first part of our waterfall is evaluating ways to reinvest in music, to continue to drive future growth. If we find opportunities that meet our return thresholds, our first priority is to deploy our operating capital, our operating cash flow into driving future growth if it meets the high return threshold that we have. Second, our second step in the waterfall is to return cash to shareholders. Third would be to pay down debt. We haven't done that in quite some time because we have found ample opportunity to invest in music to drive future growth. When we invest in driving -- in music to drive growth, it's generally in the form of advances. Advances are recoupable. So even if our cash flow in an individual quarter is down because we are laying out advances, please remember that's just timing. As our music performs, we recoup those advances. And so it really comes full circle. So we are opportunistic quarter-by-quarter based on the deals we see in the market. If there are deals that are accretive to growth and meet our return thresholds. We are more than happy to deploy our capital to accelerate future growth, especially because our advances are recouped in time as music performs. Hopefully, that helps, Matthew.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jason Bazinet with Citi. Your line is open.\nJason Bazinet: I guess over the last couple of months, the market seems to have moved from rev multiples and gross profit multiples and EBITDA multiples down to earnings and free cash. And through that lens, I just wanted to ask a quick question about cash from operations. It seemed like it was your cash generation is pretty muted, I guess, through the first half of the year. But it seems that working capital is almost always a drag in the first half and tends to reverse in the second half, not always. But can you just -- maybe it's related to the topic you just talked about in advances, but can you just elaborate on that a bit? And is there anything different that you anticipate in this fiscal year versus the last few fiscal years where we've seen a reversal in the second half?\nEric Levin: No, there's no -- again, the deployment of capital for advances is really opportunistic. It doesn't necessarily have -- it's the timing of deals. There's not really a seasonality to that. There are parts of working capital that are seasonal. Bonuses are paid in the first half of the year, for example. So you see that as a drag in the first half of each year, and then the benefit or recovery in the second half of the year. The timing of when DSP deals are renewed is not seasonal. It is just based on the timing of deals and when they're renewed. So a lot of it is just based on the timing of deals, which is hard to predict, but there are a few things like bonuses that are more of a drag in the first half of the year than the second half, Jason.\nOperator: This concludes the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Steve Cooper for closing remarks.\nSteve Cooper: Thanks again, everyone, for joining us today. We appreciate all of you taking the time. We hope you have a wonderful spring and summer, and we will talk again in a few months. Everybody stay well and stay safe. Thank you again. .\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Eric Levin",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. There is a lot to unpack within our Q2 results, but I will start with some high-level takeaways. Core streaming remains healthy -- remains incredibly healthy underpinned by strength in subscription streaming. All of our non-digital revenue lines continue to grow as well. While publishing is firing on all cylinders posting impressive results yet again. . Over the last several quarters, we've seen elevated levels of investments in A&R and M&A, which have obvious impacts on our cash flow. As expected, this has drawn attention from analysts, and shareholders who want to better understand how we view these investments, what the return thresholds are and how these investments will drive future growth. I will get into that in more detail shortly. Moving on to our results. Total revenue increased by over 13% on a constant currency basis reflecting double-digit growth in both recorded music and music publishing. On an as-reported basis, total revenue grew 10%. Total streaming revenue increased 12%, driven by growth across both businesses, including revenue from emerging streaming platforms. This strong operating performance translated to adjusted OIBDA growth of 7%, with margins of 19.9% compared to 20.4% in the prior year quarter. The decline in margin reflects the continued recovery in lower-margin artist services revenue, as well as the reduction in high-margin streaming revenue resulting from the impact of the new deal with one of our digital partners we discussed on our last earnings call. Adjusted EBITDA grew 5% with margins declining from 21.4% to 20.5% due to the same factors that impacted adjusted OIBDA. As a reminder, adjusted EBITDA includes the pro forma impact of future cost savings and certain specified transactions. You can find the calculations and reconciliations related to adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EBITDA in our press release. Recorded music revenue grew 11% driven by growth across all revenue lines. Streaming revenue increased 10% due to growth in traditional and emerging streaming platforms. As we mentioned, our results reflect the impact of the new deal with one of our digital partners, which began at the start of fiscal 2022. Adjusting for the impact of the new deal, which was $31 million in the quarter, our recorded music streaming revenue would have grown 15%. I want to provide a bit more granularity so that everyone understands the underlying trends within recorded music streaming. Normalizing for the impact of the new deal, subscription streaming revenue was robust in the high-teens. Comparability in our ad-supported streaming growth was impacted by a true-up payment that benefited the prior year quarter. As a result, ad-supported streaming, which generally grows in line with subscription streaming, grew in the high single digits. We fully expect to see a normalization in our recorded music streaming growth rate commencing in Q1 2023 once we lap the anniversary of the new digital deal. Artist services and expanded rights revenue grew by 25%, reflecting an increase in merchandising revenue and touring activity. Physical revenue grew by 8%, primarily driven by an increased worldwide demand for vinyl. Licensing revenue increased by 23%, mainly due to higher synchronization revenue. Adjusted OIBDA was $253 million, a 5% increase over prior year quarter. Margin declined from 22.9% in the prior year quarter to 22.1% due to revenue mix. Music publishing had another strong quarter as well, posting revenue of $230 million and a growth rate of 23%, reflecting increases across all revenue lines. Digital delivered strong revenue growth of 26%, driven by streaming growth of 23%, with strength across traditional and emerging platforms, digital benefit from the timing of new digital deals. Sync revenue increased over 28% due to higher commercial licensing activity in the quarter. Performance revenue increased by 9% as bars, restaurants, concerts and live events continue to recover from COVID disruption. And mechanical revenue increased 8%, benefiting from strong physical sales. Music publishing adjusted OIBDA increased 33% to $61 million, while margin increased 2.5 percentage points to 26.5% from 24%. As I mentioned on our last call, we still expect to see elevated full year CapEx in the range of $130 million to $135 million. In Q2, CapEx increased to $28 million as compared to $20 million in the prior year quarter, mainly due to investments in IT infrastructure and expansion of our E&P facilities. Our financial transformation program remains on track and is expected to deliver annualized run rate savings of $35 million to $40 million once fully implemented starting in fiscal year 2023. Operating cash flow decreased 71% to $44 million from $150 million. The decline was largely driven by the timing of royalty payments and other movements within working capital. Free cash flow decreased 88% to $16 million from $130 million in the prior year quarter. As of December 31, we had a cash balance of $385 million, total debt of $3.8 billion and net debt of $3.4 billion. Since our IPO, we have continued to actively manage our capital structure, further reducing our weighted average cost of debt from 4% to 3.3% and extending maturities, with our nearest maturity date now in 2028. There is no question that the optimal use of our capital is to invest alongside the music industry's tailwinds. I'd like to clarify a few points around the financial characteristics of our A&R and M&A investments. The vast majority of our A&R advances to artists and songwriters are recoupable, with royalties -- from royalties, and we recoup the overwhelming majority of them. It's just a matter of timing. Artist deals have become more expensive because music is worth more in the streaming era. We can pay more because we earn more. The overwhelming majority of our new artist deals provide us with substantial recording commitments and long-term rights. When we make M&A investments, they are typically accretive on day one, incremental to growth and financed with debt. With our M&A investments, which are sometimes for once-in-a-lifetime rights and catalogs, we have the luxury of being an opportunistic strategic buyer that can maximize the value of acquired rights through our global infrastructure. Whether investing in A&R or M&A, we rigorously analyze every transaction and have a high degree of conviction that our broad portfolio of investments will drive profitable growth and shareholder value for years to come. As we look ahead, we feel great about the health of our business and how we are positioning ourselves to take advantage of the vast opportunities for growth that lie ahead. Thank you for joining our call today, and we will now open the call for questions. Ben, let me tackle your second question. I'll hit a few key points, and thank you for the question on margins. So first, what we're seeing is something that we fully expected. Two is our recorded music margins actually increased once you adjust for the DSP renewal. So on a fundamental operating basis we're still seeing margin growth, but yes, your question in these results, as artist services recovers it is a lower margin business. It will cause a slowing or a flattening in margin in the short term. Once artist services recovers, we fully expect to resume our margin expansion trajectory consistent with our plans at the time of the IPO and heading towards mid-20s margin. So everything we're seeing is what we expected and, operating basis, we're still very comfortable with our commitment towards margin expansion. Thanks, Kutgun. I think that was a quite thoughtful kind of statement. Certainly, we don't give guidance. So what I would say is, this quarter, our fiscal Q2 subscription streaming continue to grow high teens, the fundamentals of that business, we see are incredibly healthy. We see penetration growth opportunities in both developed and emerging markets around the world. Spotify has had success with their price increases. Their constant currency ARPU went up 3%, I believe, in this quarter. We continue to be encouraging of others to look at pricing as an opportunity to improve economic performance of streaming. So we see streaming as being very strong, the emerging forms of streaming and what we're starting to see in Web 3.0 gives us a lot of enthusiasm as well going forward. On the ad-supported side, you're right, there was that true-up in the accounting of that this quarter that have caused it to have lower growth for this individual quarter, but the fundamentals of ad-supported streaming growth remain very healthy and we have seen and fully expect to continue to see ad-supported streaming growing in line with subscription streaming on a fundamental basis. So we feel very good about the streaming platforms, their growth and the opportunities going forward, absolutely. So Andrew, I appreciate the question. So look, there have been, and I think COVID's impact on artists' ability to tour certainly -- and low interest rates create an environment where a lot of artists were interested in exploring the sale of their catalogs. As artists are able to tour again and additional revenue streams come back to artists, and as interest rates rise, which could cause potential buyers to just analyze the math with different discount rates and come up with lower values could cause things to change over time. Obviously, interest rates are projected to go up over time. So we don't think there's a moment where either catalog values will change dramatically or artists' interest in selling will change dramatically. But over time, those changing dynamics could have changed the equation both for buyers and sellers. In the short term, we do expect more catalogs to come up for sale. We will do what we have always done, which is we analyze them on an opportunistic basis. If it's a strategic fit and well priced, we will consider doing deals, but we don't feel any pressure to do deals. We have many ways to invest capital to drive growth, both organically through M&A, launching in new markets, acquiring labels and acquiring catalogs. There's many different tools that we have, and we will continue to evaluate the market and do deals where appropriate, and work to make sure we're investing our capital with financial discipline to find the best returns for our investment and to drive the best growth profile going forward. Sure. Just writing down, there's a lot of question, Michael. So the return of touring, certainly it will be interesting. There'll certainly be some dynamics that change around the tour. So I would expect social to be a great promoter of tours around the world, artists and labels and partners using social applications to build buzz and momentum. I would expect labels and artists to be working together to create surrounding opportunities around tours, where in the past, it be tours with merch, now it will be tours with merch, and there may be Web3 applications to create micro communities that are giving NFTs and special opportunities. And those kinds of things, I think, are going to become one experimented with in the short term, what works, what the fans really love, what do they respond to, obviously, at some level, what monetizes. So I think we'll start to see experimentation in those areas, both around the release of new music but also around tours. So I think there'll be new kind of dynamics that are explored and new norms that develop over time. For the Warner Music Group, obviously, our artist services business has a significant portion that's tied to touring. We have several concert promotion businesses in Europe, in France and Spain, for example. We have a tour merch business in the U.S. And as touring comes back as we're seeing this quarter, those revenue streams start to come back, and that's a very healthy thing. Again, they are lower margin businesses, but they are positive to overall margin. Meaning not the margin percentage, but it's incremental dollars on revenue and OIBDA. So we're thrilled they're coming back. It's an important part of the music equation, and it's healthy that artist services is recovering and show signs that obviously that the economy is starting to get back to something more normal post-COVID. On the M&A side, certainly, what we focus on when it comes to geographic expansion are the emerging markets. We have always been a company that focuses on return on investment. We have been cautious not to overinvest in emerging markets before streaming and legitimate revenue streams are able to really drive growth. When those fundamentals are in place, or are starting to come into place, we start to focus on developing our capabilities in those markets. And we've done it time and time again over and over again in the past few years, in Turkey, in the Middle East, in Vietnam before that in China, and Indonesia and Brazil and Mexico. We're now looking at a series of areas that we're really excited about. Steve mentioned MENA, Middle East, North Africa, which is the fastest-growing region in the world. I think it grew 35% or so last year. We recently acquired Qanawat, the largest music distributor throughout the Middle East. We launched an organic label, an owned and operated label in the Mid-East roughly three years ago to get the start and build relationships. We developed a partnership with Rotana, one of the largest labels throughout the Middle East. So our capabilities, our infrastructure our music that we're putting out and how we're monetizing in the Middle East is changing really rapidly. We're a significant player there. And we've got a similar mindset in Africa where we acquired Africori, where we developed a partnership with Chocolate City, one of the most significant labels in Nigeria and have been releasing great music. And CK that came out of Africa had just had a global hit earlier this year. So those are two areas in the world that we're starting to see, monetize, and we're leaning into heavily. But obviously, there's other markets in Asia, Latin America that we're continuing to lean into as well. And we're very excited about the continued globalization of music. We see it as one of the really meaningful growth vectors. Sure. So E&P, you're absolutely right. So E&P was a major -- I hate to say beneficiary during COVID, but that doesn't sound like a phrase that should come out of someone's mouth easily. But E&P's business grew, maybe I'll say it that way, on an accelerated basis during COVID. There were quarters we were discussing 30%-plus growth. It just had a significant pull forward as e-commerce businesses benefited from people's desire to stay home and not go in public spaces to shop or other activities. . This year, we're seeing E&P much more of level off, if you will, and that's not because we don't think this is a long-term growth business. We do. We believe very strongly in E&P. But some of the dynamics: One the pull forward of the prior year; but two, some of the supply chain disruptions in the world have created a challenge for E&P getting the products they've ordered on time, that they need, and that has caused a challenge. They have been incredible leaders in working through those challenges and getting those resolved. But that has been a challenge with many companies around the world. E&P is not divorced from that. And quite frankly, the war in Ukraine has been a challenge as well. I think the climate in parts of Europe have been much more cautious, and there's just less of an environment for people to be shopping for, kind of, lifestyle goods. So E&P continues to do fine, but its growth trajectory has definitely in the short term leveled off. But we're very excited about E&P in the longer term. We just have to get past this moment, which we will. And then on the cash side, what I would say is it's kind of two pieces. First and foremost, we're very focused on growing our business. And as our revenue and OIBDA grow, our fundamental operating cash flow, we fully expect to grow with that. However, we have a waterfall of how we deploy our capital. The first part of our waterfall is evaluating ways to reinvest in music, to continue to drive future growth. If we find opportunities that meet our return thresholds, our first priority is to deploy our operating capital, our operating cash flow into driving future growth if it meets the high return threshold that we have. Second, our second step in the waterfall is to return cash to shareholders. Third would be to pay down debt. We haven't done that in quite some time because we have found ample opportunity to invest in music to drive future growth. When we invest in driving -- in music to drive growth, it's generally in the form of advances. Advances are recoupable. So even if our cash flow in an individual quarter is down because we are laying out advances, please remember that's just timing. As our music performs, we recoup those advances. And so it really comes full circle. So we are opportunistic quarter-by-quarter based on the deals we see in the market. If there are deals that are accretive to growth and meet our return thresholds. We are more than happy to deploy our capital to accelerate future growth, especially because our advances are recouped in time as music performs. Hopefully, that helps, Matthew. No, there's no -- again, the deployment of capital for advances is really opportunistic. It doesn't necessarily have -- it's the timing of deals. There's not really a seasonality to that. There are parts of working capital that are seasonal. Bonuses are paid in the first half of the year, for example. So you see that as a drag in the first half of each year, and then the benefit or recovery in the second half of the year. The timing of when DSP deals are renewed is not seasonal. It is just based on the timing of deals and when they're renewed. So a lot of it is just based on the timing of deals, which is hard to predict, but there are a few things like bonuses that are more of a drag in the first half of the year than the second half, Jason."

            "name": "Steve Cooper",
            "content": "Thanks, Kareem. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As we approach the two-year anniversary of our IPO, I'd like to reflect for a moment on the key pillars of our success. These are the fundamentals of our strategy, the principles we bear in mind when charting our course into the future. First, of course, is the music. It's at the heart of everything we do. While taste, trends and tech are ever-changing, our artists and songwriters will always be our driving force. Second is our global growth. About a decade ago, we set a goal to become a global music entertainment company through the expansion of our local expertise. Today, I'll share the progress we're making in growing our presence around the world. Third, we're a company that thrives at the intersection of art and technology. Innovation and data-driven insights are helping us actively create our future. And fourth, our people and our commitment to making our company a place where the best individual talents can be long and build a career. But first, let's get into our Q2 results. I'm pleased to say that they reflect the strong health of our streaming revenue, continued growth in publishing and recovery from COVID in artist services and performance. Total revenue in the quarter was almost $1.4 billion. This represents year-over-year growth of 10% and 13% on an as-reported and constant currency basis. Adjusted EBITDA was $282 million with a margin of 20.5%, compared to 21.4% in the prior year quarter. This decline was driven by our revenue mix. As our lower-margin revenue streams recovered from COVID, they became bigger contributors to overall revenue. We continue to expect that we'll achieve our long-term margin targets in the next several years as mix and growth rates normalize. In recorded music, our revenue was approximately $1.15 billion, an increase of 11.4% from the prior year quarter, with streaming revenue growing 10%. Normalizing for the impact of the new digital deal that we discussed on our Q1 earnings call, recorded music total revenue and streaming revenue both grew by 15%. artist services and physical continue to show impressive recovery with revenue growth of 25% and 8%, respectively. Licensing revenue powered by sync grew 23%. In publishing, we delivered revenue of $230 million, 23% more than the prior year quarter, driven by growth across all revenue lines. Company-wide streaming revenue from emerging platforms grew to $345 million on an annualized basis, up from $325 million in Q1. And now on to the music. An important differentiator for the Warner Music Group is our focus on long-term artist development. These days, there's a misconception that all music majors are just following the same data and chasing artists who already have a significant presence in the market. That's not quite true for us. First and foremost, we seek out originality. When we identify really great artists and songwriters, we collaborate with them to ensure that they have the opportunity to realize their full potential. Most of our biggest superstars were signed to one of our labels at the very beginning of their careers. This commitment to extraordinary talent is something that has distinguished us for decades. Legendary voices like Aretha Franklin and Fleetwood Mac have now been joined by visionary performers like Lizzo and Ed Sheeran. The impact of our unique irreplaceable catalog in music will reverberate for generations. At this year's Grammys, Silk Sonic, the R&B super-duo of Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak took home the highly coveted Record of the Year and Song of the Year awards, plus two more. Bruno has now won Record of the Year 3 times, a feat previously accomplished only by Paul Simon. Without question, he now ranks as one of the world's greatest entertainers. We're always developing the next wave of culture shaping music that will create the sound track of tomorrow. For example, Gayle kicked off the year with number one worldwide Smash ABCDEFU and Jack Harlow's new single First Class debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 last month. Dua Lipa and Megan Thee Stallion racked up over 40 million streams in just one week with their hit collaboration Sweetest Pie. Our publishing team also continues to excel with an impressive 90 songs charting on the Billboard Hot 100 over the course of Q2. Some of the biggest hits that our songwriters contributed to this quarter were Silk Sonic's Smoking Out the Window, Rauw Alejandro's Desperados and Dave's, Starlight. Warner Chappell had a superb showing at this year's Grammys. In addition to Bruno and Anderson, who are also Warner Chappell's songwriters, we saw big wins for Chris Stapleton for Best Country Song and Ojivolta for Best Rap Song. Warner Chappell is winning highly competitive deals for talent around the world and across the music spectrum. From Nigeria's, Tay Iwar to Italy's, Sick Luke to the U.S.'s, Nicolle Galyon. In March, we signed two important deals with Patrick Moxey, the Founder of Dance Label Ultra. Warner Chappell now administers Ultra's 6,000 copyrights throughout Europe, including songs from Drake, Rihanna and The Weeknd among many others. And Warner recorded music also entered into a strategic alliance with Patrick's legendary Payday Records as well as his new label, Helix. At a time, when domestic music is on the rise in most countries, we're also one of the few companies with the resources and expertise to take a truly global approach to artist development. This strategy requires a mix of organic A&R investment, partnerships with the most credible local players and financially disciplined acquisitions of catalogs and labels. Across established and emerging markets, we create the conditions for success to travel at the speed of sound. We saw a perfect example of our long-term strategy and action, when and Anitta and Paulo Londra both signed to Warner Music Latin America, took number one and number two on Spotify's global chart. With her Monster Hit, Envolver, Anitta made history as the first Brazilian to hit the top spot, while Paulo has spent five consecutive weeks at the top of Billboard's Argentina 100. According to IFPI's 2022 Global Music Report, MENA was the fastest-growing market in 2021, up 35% year-over-year. This quarter, we announced that we would be acquiring Qanawat Music, the region's largest independent distributor, which will expand our presence in this important territory. Qanawat is on the ground in Dubai, Cairo and Casablanca and offers services in more than 20 countries. Having only launched Warner Music Middle East in 2018, we moved quickly to become a leading player in this region. India is another rapidly growing market where we focused our attention and have increased our market share meaningfully in the last 24 months. We've recently partnered with some of Bollywood's biggest talents. And last month, Warner Music India entered into a strategic partnership with Jjust Music, founded by renowned Actor and Producer, Jackky Bhagnani. This will give us access to marquee Bollywood releases while Jjust Music artists will benefit from our worldwide network. In March, we partnered with Diljit Dosanjh, one of India's biggest film and music superstars. We're already working together to amplify his global career, including collaborations with Canadian rapper Tory Lanez and Tanzanian Star Diamond Platnumz. Across the globe, blockbuster albums from the likes of Red Hot Chili Peppers, Ed Sheeran and Kodak Black are showing incredible staying power. And we're excited about what's on the horizon with new music coming from stars like Lizzo, Ava Max and Cardi B, as well as our next generation of hit makers such as PinkPantheress, Bella Poarch and Tiago PZK. As the world grapples with war, inflation and other macroeconomic concerns, one thing is certain: music's ubiquity and the value have already proven to be resilient through any kind of disruption. Unlike the video streaming market, which churns as subscribers constantly search for new and different exclusive content, the music streaming market is sticky. Subscribers have access to all the music they could ever want on a single platform, and they become attached to the collections and playlists they have curated over time. And while films and TV series may come and go, devotion to one's favorite music and artist is more deep-seated and longer lasting. As new platforms emerge, it becomes increasingly clear that whatever the mode of consumption, music is the common thread that runs throughout the entire entertainment economy. We're one of the few companies with the reach, skills and capabilities to connect the dots for artists and songwriters on a global basis. We protect and promote the value of music. We help creators navigate an incredibly complex landscape, and we deepen the connection between artists and fans. As streaming continues to scale and social media provides increasingly meaningful revenue, there is now a lot of buzz about Web3. Since 2019, we've been strategically investing in tech companies that feature music prominently in their offerings. This has built our reputation as the planet's most innovative future-focused music company. These investments have fostered partnerships at the intersection of gaming, social and entertainment with brands such as Roblox, Fortnite and The Sandbox. And we formed groundbreaking relationships with innovation leaders such as Genies, Blockparty, OneOf and Dapper Labs. As a recent example, we've also partnered with blockchain gaming developers Splinterlands to give Warner Music artists the tools to develop arcade-style games such as the extremely popular DAP. The latest deal we signed was with proof of attendance protocol, POAP for short. This will enable us to mint shared memories as NFTs, giving collectors authenticated digital proof they were part of a specific experience or event. Atlantic Records' rapper, Kevin Gates, recently tapped into the technology offering fans who attended his sold-out Red Rock's concert of POAP to commemorate the show. As I mentioned earlier, we thrive at the intersection of art and technology. We were very excited to announce that Mike Shinoda, Co-Founder of the Warner Records band Linkin' Park, has been enlisted as our first-ever community innovation adviser. Mike is a music tech visionary who will be a great source of wisdom and insight as our artists bring their creative visions to life on multiple new platforms. I've talked before about our network of direct-to-consumer destinations, including UPROXX, HipHopDX, Songkick and EMP. These companies all fall under the umbrella of our newly rebranded media and content arm WMX. Last week, at our first ever New Fronts event for brands and advertisers, WMX unveiled new culture driving original programming that will roll out across these outlets later this year. These programs include: Fresh Pair with Katty Customs, a sneaker culture show co-hosted and executive produced by Just Blaze; Iconic Records, a visual podcast that will explore the legacy of Notorious B.I.G.; and Limited, a merch design competition featuring hot artists and emerging creators. WMX already ranks as a top five video company in the U.S., and this exciting roster of programming will bring advertisers new opportunities to reach young, engaged and influential audiences. The other two areas of incremental revenue I'd like to highlight today are, first, digital fitness. WMG was the music launch partner for Peloton's gaming-inspired fitness experience, Lanebreak. The first artist featured on Lanebreak were two Warner Legends, David Bowie and David Guetta. Second, podcasting. Following the success of shows like People's Party with Talib Kweli, we're continuing to build our presence in this space. Last month, we announced the launch of Interval Presents, our in-house podcast network sitting at the crossroads of music, pop culture and social impact. We already have shows in the works from Oscar-winning actress Lupita Nyong'o, and Grammy-nominated singer Jason Derulo, among other major talents. When we took the company public less than two years ago, many of these business models were only nascent. While we still have plenty of work to do, we've made great progress in a very short period. Our strategies are proving to be sound. The universe of possibilities continues to expand in every direction and will enhance the growth of an already robust music entertainment industry. IFPI reported that the global recorded music industry grew by an impressive 18.5% in 2021. We're proud to say that we outperformed this benchmark by almost 2.5 percentage points, a testament to our impact on global culture and our ability to create communities of fans across every medium. During our last call, we talked about our DEI commitments, which we unveiled as part of our first ESG report. This quarter, we announced a new initiative designed to help us achieve those objectives, our DEI Institute, the first of its kind within the music industry. It will help us tap into a wide array of external expertise as we educate our employees and implement action plans across our company. Before I hand it over to Eric, I would be remiss if I didn't talk about the situation in Ukraine. We pray that this conflict ends soon and that the people of Ukraine can live in peace. As it's done throughout history, music is playing an indispensable role in lifting spirits and giving hope during this terrible hardship. We're committed to supporting relief efforts, both for the people in Ukraine and the refugee population. This includes contributions to the Red Cross, Polish Humanitarian Action and Project Hope. As we announced in early March, we suspended operations in Russia. We're very excited about all the great new music and fresh initiatives that will be introduced through the balance of the year. We look forward to keeping you updated as we continue to build our momentum. And with that, I'll turn it over to Eric. All right. Thanks for your questions, Ben. I'll take the first one, which is really about the changes in the world since our IPO. I think everybody is seeing -- and is concerned about some of these situations that involve in the world today: War, inflation, rising interest rates. That being said, music has, and I believe will continue to prove its resilience because it is fundamental to human nature, whether it be in good times or bad times. I would remind everyone that at the height of the pandemic, music consumption continued to increase and new use cases emerged virtually every day. So our long-term outlook remains unchanged. And if anything, we're even more optimistic. As Eric mentioned, streaming continues to be strong, both in established and emerging markets and new opportunities are coming online all the time. Many of the emerging business models that we had talked about at the time of our IPO are now generating meaningful revenue and are growing faster than traditional revenue streams. I also believe that we're better positioned to capitalize on these opportunities because of our size and our innovative mindset. We remain committed to long-term artist development. We were early to see opportunities in emerging markets, and we continue to seek out, find and seize those opportunities. We are clearly the market leader by way of innovation. We saw it with streaming. And now as we see the Web3 space, we've moved faster and in more agile ways than our competitors. We've been the first to set precedent setting deals and we'll continue to do so. So I'm very confident despite all of the craziness and chaos in the world that music will continue to be a driving force in our lives and in business until the end of time. Hopefully, that answers your question number one, Ben. So I'll start on the emerging streaming fix versus variable question. So it is absolutely something that we've been working with our emerging streaming partners. Note that we literally have hundreds of licenses with many different categories of products and services. So it's not a onetime thing, but we are -- and one thing just to set the table, emerging streaming platforms are generally services or products that are multimedia. Music is incorporated into the product, critically essential to their products, but it can be music paired with video, music paired with a game, music paired with graphics or some other social or fitness multimedia product. We have been encouraging and working with these partners for them to develop the systems and capabilities to report on music on a stream-by-stream, consumption-detailed basis that allows us to have truly variable deals. As they develop those capabilities, it is our intent to negotiate variable deals tied to revenue or consumption, whatever the right variable is, and we're moving towards that. In this quarter, there were no major renewals, smaller renewals, but not major renewals. So we continue to work towards that end. What I will say is it will take some time. Different companies are making different degrees of progress on developing the systems capabilities to track music on a stream-by-stream, consumption basis. So it's not going to be a moment but a process that we're working with over time. Hopefully, that answers your first question. What I will say is that we are incredibly excited about what we're seeing, and you see this focus of our partnerships on Web3-type capabilities, whether it's NFTs, avatars, games that can be installed within metaverses. We think there's an extraordinary amount of opportunity to be developed there. We want to develop long-term business models, not one-offs that come and go and can't be sustained. So we're working on a series of projects and experiments with various partners that we've talked about. And a lot of our artists are interested in exploring this field. Steve mentioned several in his talking points like Kevin Gates, so we're very excited about this as a future and new avenue of growth, and we're really working very hard to be innovators in this space. On the macro economy side, what I would say is that music is a cornerstone of people's lives. We think music is -- has the expectation -- we have the expectation it will be incredibly resilient even as macroeconomic challenges emerge. We think it's different than other forms of streaming, focusing on that for a second. In other forms of streaming, people generally have like video, multiple streaming services, each of which have different content and people can decide which one they value more than another streaming service. In audio, people generally have one streaming service they subscribe to, which is all the music aggregated in one place. We think it's a very, if you will, fairly priced, if not even low-priced, high-value service that's central to people's lives. And so we think what we've been seeing and what we expect is that it will be incredibly resilient there. And so we think music and the innovation of new digital services represents a continued growth market for music as we look forward despite macroeconomic challenges, and we've been seeing that so far. That said, we continue to monitor everything that's happening in the world and in the economy, to look at areas where we continue to get more efficient, areas where we should be focusing resources to drive the best revenue growth and value creation. And so we continue to be mindful and focused on a changing and complex world, but we're still extremely optimistic about the growth vectors of music going forward. Thanks again, everyone, for joining us today. We appreciate all of you taking the time. We hope you have a wonderful spring and summer, and we will talk again in a few months. Everybody stay well and stay safe. Thank you again. ."

And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve.\nSteve Cooper: Thanks, Kareem. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. When we spoke last in mid-November, I indicated to you that we would have a productive end to 2021. The last few months have met those expectations. And as a result, we're off to a great start in fiscal'22. In Q1, our total revenue was $1.6 billion, an all-time high during our 18 years as a stand-alone company. We saw growth over the prior year quarter by 21% and 22% on and as-reported in constant-currency basis, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA was $389 million, an increase of 31% with margin improvement driven by strong revenue growth in both our recorded music and publishing businesses. In Recorded Music, our revenue was nearly $1.4 billion, another 18-year record, an increase of 21% from the prior year quarter.  Streaming revenue grew 22%, artist services and physical continued to show impressive recovery with revenue growth of 33% and 14% respectively. Licensing revenue grew 13%. In Publishing, we delivered revenue of $229 million and a growth of 32% over the prior year quarter driven by double-digit increases across all revenue lines while the quarterly revenue and year-over-year growth also represent record highs. I've regularly highlighted our increasing focus on revenue from emerging streaming platforms in areas like social, fitness, and gaming. Until now, we've been reporting this revenue only for recorded music. Going forward, we will report this revenue for recorded music and for publishing on a combined basis.  On an annualized basis, this revenue increased from $310 million in Q4 to $325 million in Q1 driven by growth in recorded music and publishing. Our approach to music is all about expanding our universe of opportunities. We are constantly seeking innovative openings to bring more music to more people in more ways and in more places. The agility and imagination with which we maximize the value of our music sets us apart from our competitors. Right now, a lot of money is being thrown at music as a so-called asset class. In this environment, artists, songwriters and tech entrepreneurs have many different options for building their businesses and brands. We're being recognized for our unique position in this growing music ecosystem. Our creative expertise, our global infrastructure, our willingness to experiment, give us our strength, and give us our edge.  While taking risk is part of our business, we pride ourselves on taking educated risks across a wide investment portfolio with the financially disciplined, ROI-focused perspective. Toward the end of the calendar year, we completed several strategic acquisitions that reflect our approach. We acquired 300 Entertainment, one of the most influential labels to emerge in the 21st century. It has developed a distinctive identity and a dynamic community of arts. We are honored to welcome to the Warner Music Group Megan Thee Stallion, Young Thug, , Mary J. Blige and many more. 300 shares the independent spirit that's always been part of Warner story, our DNA, and our vision. With this deal Kevin Lyles, who co-founded 300, became the Chairman and CEO of both 300 and our Elektra Music Group. We also acquired the required for rights to David Bowie's entire publishing ADA log in compassing hundreds of songs across this revolutionary six decade period.  Three months earlier, we closed a first -- a new licensing deal, David Bowie's recorded music very well. We're now home to this incredible body of work as both of recording artist and songwriter. And in a deal that makes us one of the biggest music distributors in Africa, we acquired a majority stake in Africori, the continent's leading artist development, rights management, and digital distribution company. Last year, Africori reported strong revenue growth across all major guest piece through the generation of hundreds of millions of audio streams and billions of YouTube views. These deals are already producing dividends. Gunna's new album on 300 Entertainment DS4Ever landed at number one on the Billboard 200, giving him his second chart topper.  And just a month after our Bowie acquisition, Peloton introduced the David Bowie collection, which makes every release in his catalog available for Peloton users as the soundtrack to their workouts. 300, Bowie and Africori bolster are already incredible roster of artists and songwriters. Our star power was on full display when this year's Grammy nominations were announced. Electric's Brandi Carlile, and Atlantic Silk Sonic, both received multiple nominations. Also landing in the top categories were Atlantic's Ed Sheeran, for song of the year and Warner Records Sweetie for best new artist.  In Publishing, we received numerous nominations, including song of the year and best wrap and country songs among many others. We bring original artists and inspiring songwriters of every genre, geography, and generation to the world stage. We're a place where quality and diversity matter. That's the mindset behind our constant, ever-growing flow of great new music. In Q1, we saw the chart topping album, chart topping return album, some stars like Kodak Black and Roddy Ricch, as well as strong carryover performances from Ed Sheeran and Cold Blood. Latin American artists Tiago PZK, and Petro  have set social media on fire with hundreds of thousands of TikTok videos having been created from their hit songs. With over 800 million on demand audio and video streams combined, Dua Lipa\u2019s Levitating was the most stream song of 2021 in the U.S. and was the number 1 song of year on billboards year-end singles chart. Atlantic's rising star, Gail, has racked up over 3 million TikTok video creations and half a billion streams from her debut single. South Africa\u2019s CKay continue to hit new peaks with multiple versions of his global smash, Love Nwantiti, which has surpassed 600 million screens, more than triple what I've reported on our last call.  Meanwhile, Warner Chappell continued its impressive run, signing key deals with Cardi B and R&B icon Jhen\u00e9 Aiko, and partnering on a new deal with Tim & Danny Music to sign Sam Smith. Warner Chappell Warner Chappell national landed BMI publisher of the year for the fourth consecutive year, and took home CSX publisher of the year accolade. It's second win in three years. Warner Chappell was also number one on billboards year-end Latin publisher chart for the fourth year in a row, and ranked second on billboards year-end at 100 publishers list. Music is no longer linear, transactional or limited by format. It's complex, multifaceted, and interactive.  The intersection of virtual social spaces, gaming and music presents enormous opportunities to engage with massive and diverse audiences. We're leaning in and taking control of our future through a series of strategic partnerships, collaborations, and investments. We kicked off the year with collaborations with some of the biggest names in this space. Roblox featured David Guetta in the first-ever DJ set performed by an avatar. On Fortnite, Tones and I, brought hits from her debut chart topping album to the platform Soundwave Series. Meanwhile, Silk Sonic joined the platform's Icon Series, allowing players to express themselves as the Grammy nominated duo with '70s inspired outfits and accessories and to discover music through the new icon radio station.  From collectibles to music royalties, Web3 represents an exciting future for the music industry that will help our artists to reach millions upon millions of new fans in interesting and innovative ways. Since our investment in Dapper Labs in 2019, been consistently investing, building, and partnering in Web3 opportunities. We're continuing in this direction at an even faster clip in 2022. In January alone, we launched three important partnerships in the Web3 space. We partnered with one of, the company backed by music legend Quincy Jones. We'll be collaborating to create artist NFTs using their eco -friendly green Web3 platform. We announced the first major music partnership with the Digital's Collectible Platform, Block party.  Our initial collaboration is with the Venus superstars . We also became the first major music company to partner with the Sandbox. We'll be working with them to build out WMG land, a space where fans will be able to connect with their favorite artist through virtual experiences in NFT's. We've been talking to you for several quarters now, above our differentiated dynamic range of artist and label services, covering everything from streaming, to merge, to branded content in IRR. The strategy was crystallized late last year when we unveiled WMX, giving this important segment of our business a fresh look and unified approach. WMX brings together a culturally curious audience of music lovers that currently totals more than a quarter of a billion monthly unique visitors. These connections are driven by our wholly-owned media brands, UPROXX, Songkick, and HipHopDX.  WMX is right by Comscore among the top five video media companies, for 18 to 34 year-old audiences in the United States. It generates almost 50 billion monthly views on our premium YouTube channels, as well as other streaming and social media platforms. WMX is helping to differentiate us in our mission to attract and amplify original artists by building broader and deeper fan bases. As you all know, there is a growing wave of interest in what companies are doing about important environmental, social, and governance issues. To us, continuing to become a more equitable and sustainable company, there's moral, commercial, and creative imperative. This is something we've been passionate about for many years, and we've taken important steps since we hired Samantha Sims as our head of ESG back in August. Last week, we released our inaugural ESG report, which can be found on our website.  The report outlines how we believe we can more effectively address social and environmental challenges our global society is facing. Along with details about our north star DEI commitments, the report also highlights some of our initial accomplishments related to fighting climate change, producing more sustainable products, and other important initiatives. We recently announced the third round of grant recipients from the Warner Music Group, or Blavatnik Family Foundation Social Justice Fund. Since the fund was announced in June 2020, it has pledged $22.5 million to two dozen organizations. It's contributions continue to reflect at the fund strategic pillars, criminal justice reform, education, and arts and culture. While also addressing the intersection of race in gender and equity. We view all these initiatives as long-term commitments to action and accountability and we're excited about the path we're on. Before I pass the mic to Lou, I have some good news about the return of our CFO, Eric Levin.  As you are all aware, Eric has been out of medical leave since November and we're happy and excited as he'll be rejoining us as CFO next week. Many, many thanks to Lou for the amazing job that he's been doing as acting CFO, in addition to his important responsibilities as our SVP and Corporate Controller. We couldn't be more enthusiastic about the amazing new music we have in store this year from our talented artists and songwriters. Even so Cardi B, Jack Harlow, Bella Porch, and many, many others are going to be back with really great new music. We're more convinced than ever that Web3 will be one of the next steps in the evolution of the music  system. As the global entertainment economy continues to change at light speed. Major music companies are the only ones with the skill sets, the global footprint, and the financial resources to fully support artists and songwriters. At the Warner Music Group, we're unrelenting champions of the incredible work of our artists and songwriters, and fierce advocates for their rights as creators. So, again, thank you to everyone in our company who makes this possible, and thank you to our shareholders for your continued support. With that, I'll hand it over to Lou.\nLou Dickler: Thank you, Steve. And good morning, everyone. Our Q1 results are highlighted by record high revenue across the board since we became a stand-alone company in 2004. These results were driven by growth in traditional and emerging streaming platforms, as well as continued recovery in physical and artist services, all of which underpin the continued momentum across our business. Before I get into our results, I'd like to highlight an item that affected compatibility this quarter. Q1 includes the benefit of an additional week of operating performance versus the prior year quarter. Due to the timing of our 52/53 week financial calendar, the additional week fell in December 2021. And as a result, this fiscal quarter is a 14-week quarter versus the standard 13-week quarter in the prior year.  This additional week primarily benefited our recorded music streaming revenue and will only impact Q1 as all of the subsequent quarters in fiscal '22 are 13 weeks, consistent with the prior-year. Moving now to our results, total revenue increased by over 22% on a constant currency basis and 21% on an as-reported basis, reflecting strong performance in both recorded music and music publishing. Starting this quarter, we will break out streaming revenue for each of recorded music and music publishing and we will report revenue from emerging streaming platforms through Recorded Music and Music Publishing on a combined basis. Total streaming revenue increased 24% driven by growth across both segments.  This strong operating performance translated to impressive adjusted OIBDA growth of 26% with margins improving from 21.1% to 22%. Our margin growth is particularly notable given the continued strong recovery in lower-margin revenue lines, such as artist services. Adjusted EBITDA grew 31% with margins improving from 22.2% to 24.1%. Also driven by strong operating performance and the pro forma impact of future cost savings and the transactions we closed in the quarter. You can find the calculations and reconciliations related to adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EBITDA in our press release. Recorded Music revenue grew 21%, underpinned by growth across all revenue lines. Streaming revenue increased by 22%, driven by growth in subscription, ad supported, and emerging streaming platforms. As I noted earlier, these results also benefited from the additional week in December and were partially offset by the impact of a new deal with one of our DSP partners, which began at the start of fiscal 2022. Adjusting for the net impact of the additional week, which was $60 million, and the new DSP deal, which was $28 million, our recorded music streaming revenue would have grown by approximately 18% while this new DSP deal is now consistent with our other major DSP deals.  We are seeing a variance relative to the prior deal, which will result in similar impact on year-over-year comparisons that will extend throughout the remainder of fiscal '22. We fully expect to see a normalization of our recording music streaming growth rate commencing in Q1 2023. Artist services and expanded rights revenue, which includes merchandising, grew by over 33%, reflecting an increase in merchandising and concert promotion revenue as touring has resumed. Physical revenue grew by 14%, primarily driven by strong new releases and a worldwide demand for vinyl. Licensing revenue increased by 13% mainly due to higher synchronization and other licensing revenue as businesses continued to recover from COVID disruption. Adjusted OIBDA was $336 million, a 22% increase over the prior year quarter with margins improving to 24.2%. This growth was driven by strong operating performance across all revenue lines.  Music Publishing had a record quarter as well posting revenue of $229 million, a growth rate of 32% over the prior year quarter, reflecting double-digit growth across all revenue lines. Digital led the way with revenue growth of over 34% driven by streaming growth of 36% reflecting strength across traditional and emerging platforms. Sync revenue increased over 31% due to higher television, motion picture, and commercial income in the quarter and COVID disruption in the prior year quarter. Growth performance in mechanical revenue increased by 27% as businesses continue to recover from COVID disruption with mechanical benefiting from strong physical sales. Music publishing adjusted OIBDA increased 38% to $55 million, while margin increased 1.1% points to 24%. This increase in adjusted OIBDA margin was primarily due to strong operating performance.  As mentioned on our last call, we still expect to see elevated full-year CapEx in the range of $130 million to a $135 million. In Q1, CapEx increased to $34 million as compared to $18 million in the prior-year quarter, mainly due to the investments in IT infrastructure and the expansion of our E and P facilities to address the strong demand in our e-commerce business. Our financial transformation program remains on track and is expected to deliver annualized run rate savings of about $35 million to $40 million once fully implemented starting in fiscal year 2023. Operating cash flow decreased 24% to $129 million from $169 million. The decline was largely driven by continued A&R investment in the timing of working capital. Free cash flow decreased 37% to $95 million from $151 million in the prior year quarter. As of December 31, we had a cash balance of $450 million, total debt of $3.85 billion and net debt of $3.4 billion. Since our IPO, we have continued to actively manage our capital structure, further reducing our weighted average cost of debt from 4% to 3.2% and extending maturities with our nearest maturity date now in 2028.  And earlier this morning, we announced that we will be issuing our next quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share. As we look ahead, our business has more growth drivers than ever before, whether in recorded music where we continue to see growth in traditional and emerging streaming, acceleration in safe and the return of artist services in vital and at Warner Chappell now the performance is stabilizing and streaming and Sync are surging. This diversification gives us more confidence than ever that we're well-positioned for continued strong growth. We are truly excited about the steady flow of great new music we have in store and look forward to an amazing remainder of the year. Thank you for joining our call today, and we will now open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. . Please stand by while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question comes from Michael Morris with Guggenheim. Your line is open.\nMichael Morris: Hi. Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask you a couple of questions about your relationships with your largest streaming distribution partners. First, Lou, you referenced that $28 million headwind from the new deal with streaming partner. Can you expand a bit on why this renewal had a negative impact, what it means for your growth for the balance of the year and beyond and what it could mean for renewals with other partners? And then Steve, I'm hoping you can address this. These are public controversy that Spotify is having, the Joe Rogan podcast right now. What the implications can be for Warner Music?  I know it's pretty vast topic. There's a lot to cover, but maybe you could share your thoughts on how Spotify carrying something so controversial can impact your relationship with them and the broader concern that's now coming up, that has to do with how much Spotify's compensating music artist with the compensation to the podcast contributors being so high. We'd appreciate your thoughts on that. Thanks, guys.\nLou Dickler: So Michael, on the first question, with regard to the DSP renewal, this is a short-term financial anomaly. It really understates the strength of streaming that we're seeing at Warner. All the deals we have with our global DSP snow fall within a very tight end, and the oddity of the comparison that we're seeing, and that's created one exist beyond fiscal 2022. We're incredibly confident that traditional -- both traditional and emerging platforms will continue to experience strong growth. And as a result, our 2022 and beyond  have changed.\nSteve Cooper: Great. So let me see if I can deal with the Spotify issue or issues that you raised Michael. First of all, just to be clear, Neil Young, Jimmie Nicol, Crosby, Stills & Nash are legendary artists. And as such, they continue to have an amazing impact on culture after more than 50 years of creating wonderful, wonderful music. Our first inclination is to always support our artists and it is good to see that Spotify was responding to this issue in an attempt to resolve it, but they should be the ones that speak about their own positions and there, call it signals. We do trust to be crystal clear. We do business with hundreds of streaming operations around the world not only traditional streamers, but these new emerging business platforms. And we and our artists broadly speaking feel very good about those revenue streams that are generated many on a consumption basis. And we, the Warner Music Group, as I mentioned in my remarks, continue to fight day and night for our artists and songwriters to ensure that they are compensated for their work and is equitable a fashion as possible.\nMichael Morris: Thanks. Steve, if I could just real briefly, it sounds like you're saying that while you're still very much trying to represent artists and ensure compensation broadly, you're not necessarily highlighting a disparity between different DSPs as compensating better or worse, or fairly or unfairly compared to another? Is that what you're saying there?\nSteve Cooper: No. As Lou mentioned, virtually all of our deals fall within a very tight fan of economics. And when you look at Spotify, they are in the process of building, as Daniel Ek announced several years ago, a podcast business. The economics of that business are different than the economic relationship that we have with Spotify on the music side.\nMichael Morris: Great. Thank you. Appreciate it.\nSteve Cooper: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Hey, good morning. Thanks for the disclosure on the emerging streaming revenues, and looking at that on a total company basis, I'm wondering if you think that revenue base can grow again this fiscal year. I know the timing of those deals are lumpy and then you probably can't be super specific on when you have major renewals, but just if you expect that there is an opportunity to grow that in this fiscal year ahead still.  And then for Steve, I think you mentioned Web3 twice in your prepared remarks. I certainly I'm not going to pretend to be a Web3 expert, but we're certainly getting questions from investors about how this could be a risk to any of the existing players in audio label, and DSP s and -- the idea being Web3 and blockchain allows artists and fans to be more directly connected and essentially eliminate or reduce the impact or the profits available to intermediaries, if you will excuse the crude reference. Anyway, I'd love to hear your thoughts. I'm sure you have a view on this as to the role of a label in Web3 music distribution, which is starting to become something that people are focusing more on. Thank you.\nSteve Cooper: Lou, why don't you take the first part and then I'll take the second part.\nLou Dickler: So since our IPO, we have seen significant growth across emerging streaming platforms in social and fitness. As you mentioned because of the nature of those deals, a lot of them are buyout deals, not consumption-based, the revenue patterns can be at times a bit step as opposed to linear. Obviously as those services mature and they go to consumption model that will convert to a more linear pattern. We are expecting stable growth to continue within emerging streaming platform through the balance of the year. And as we -- Steve mentioned and you alluded to, we do see enormous long-term potential is Web3 scales. And we see opportunities in collectibles entities, another Web3 opportunities.\nSteve Cooper: Great. Before I address Web3, let me just say that we've been very consistent with respect to traditional streaming, both in mature markets and in emerging markets. We still see tremendous potential for growth. When you look at the subscriptions relative to the smart device population, when you look at the nascent trend of raising prices that are sticking all of these put us on markers that say these areas will continue to enjoy very, very nice growth for the foreseeable future. We see the slim opportunities albeit as new points out. In many of these emerging models, they have -- at least at the moment, they lean more towards buyouts in consumption.  But we continue to see new models coming to market every day. We continue to see those models that have been in the market for a year or two continue to grow. And so we are confident that on what we would now describe as the more traditional side to the business that long-term sustained growth is in our view quite profitable.  With respect to Web3, which is a broad way of talking about blockchain, crypto, NFT is a form of crypto and so on, we see not only the beginning of interactive models coming to the surface and beginning to engage fandom around the world, but we think there are going to be more opportunities than we can even imagine as I'm sitting here in my kitchen today. I will say this, I think that the emergence of Web3 is going to further amplify the importance of music labels and publishers.  This is an area between models that will emerge, the technology of blockchain, the perils of navigating crypto, the skill sets required to deal with distributed autonomous organizations will require organizations like us that have the financial resources, the intellectual capital, by that I mean the specific skill sets, and the global footprint to be able to help our artists and songwriters not only navigate through this brave new world or brave new universe, but navigate successfully in order to optimize their presence inside the world of Web3 and to optimize their revenue options and their revenue alternatives inside of Web3. So I think labels and publishers will be more important than they are today as the world becomes more and more complex. I don't believe that when I look at individual artist managers -- their agents, that they will be able to be as successful as they can be, unless they navigate these move but very interesting waters with Warner Music and others like us.\nBen Swinburne: Thank you, guys.\nLou Dickler: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Maral with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nBen Maral: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. One on capital allocation and one on margins if I could. First, you've clearly been very active in investing to sustain or if not accelerate our growth through strategic acquisitions. Historically, you've been very consistent with your capital allocation philosophy, financial discipline and ROI -focused, but I'm just trying to better understand if the new deals are indicative of a greater focus on M&A and maybe willingness to deploy capital as we move ahead particularly as we might be at the cusp of a pretty massive step function increase in free cash flow over the next few years. And second, EBITDA margins continue to be a bright spot, up almost 200 basis points year-over-year to over 24% despite the meaningful recovery and lower-margin revenue streams. Can you just help us think about the puts and takes as you track towards a mid-20% range? It seems like you might get there well ahead of expectations, but would, of course, appreciate your perspectives, and I'm not sure if recent M&A is accretive or dilutive to margins? Thanks.\nSteve Cooper: Lou, why don't I take the capital allocation and then you can take the margins. Thanks for your questions by the way. With respect to capital allocation, our philosophy remains the same albeit it gets refined at the edges from time to time. We still look first to reinvest in the business and that reinvestment in the business falls into several pockets. One is to invest in identifying new artists, new songwriters, their songs and their music, and we will continue to invest assertively in our core business to ensure a constant and ever-growing flow of new artists and new music. We are also investing heavily in our internal infrastructures because we are committed to be, and we are well on our way by being an immersive, tech enabled 21st Century digital company.  And in order to achieve that goal, we have to provide our organization with the appropriate tools whether it's the self-serving, well organized data oceans, whether it'd be robotics, whether it be the digitization of processes, we have to have those tools to reach our goals and to enhance and support the decision-making of our people that already utilize good judgment, financial discipline, and are accountable for these choices. So our internal capital allocation remain the same. Externally, we will continue to look for opportunities where we believe that between the opportunity, what we have to pay, the desire that the immediately accretive, and our long-term ability to grow those acquisitions. We will continue also in that area to be quite assertive with respect to investing in these technologies, some of which we discussed in our prepared remarks.  We are committed to be on the leading edge of change within our segment of the music ecosystem. And if you look at our investment strategy, we intend to be first at point a, first at point B, first at point C because we want to create our future. We don't want to follow somebody else into it, and that philosophy is also going to continue to prevail. Lou, why don't you cover the margin issue.\nLou Dickler: From a margin perspective, obviously we did see some margin expansion as we move through COVID. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, is that lower-margin revenue returned. We did see some margin compression in the period, although we're still able to deliver strong margin for the quarter, an increase in margin year-over-year. Long term, we expect the revenue mix and the continued growth in streaming, including emerging streaming platforms to contribute nicely to margin expansion. We also have the cost-savings initiatives we've talked about around fit and otherwise, which will drive margin improvement. We obviously did too material deals at the end of December with 300 Entertainment and David Bowie Publishing Catalog. We think there's a lot of growth potential within those assets and also some operating efficiencies because this closed laden in the quarter, we're not seeing the impact of those within the quarter in the December. But obviously, when we get to March, we'll start to see that flow through. And because those are accretive deals, they will help margin expansion nicely.\nBen Maral: That's great. Thank you, both.\nLou Dickler: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Your line is open.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Thank you. Lou, on the new revenue streams; thanks for the clarity on the publishing side of the business. But if you could just break them down a bit to help us understand if it grew sequentially on the same basis that it was measured last quarter as well? That would be helpful to understand how the underlying trends are.\nLou Dickler: Yeah, the --\nKannan Venkateshwar: Sorry. Go ahead.\nLou Dickler: The expansion -- the growth in emerging streaming sequentially included both growth in Recorded Music and Music Publishing.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Got it. That's helpful. And then in terms of the impact, the $28 million impact on the DSP side, it sounded like it's because of restructuring these deals on account of podcasts on the role they're playing. I mean, correct me if I'm wrong, but does that also mean the contribution margin impact going forward may be different compared to the overall contribution margin of the business as a whole. So if you can just help us understand the EBITDA impact of that revenue stream that will be useful as well. And I have one follow-up with Steve.\nLou Dickler: On the DSP item, the 28 that you've quoted it was unrelated to the impact of podcasting. It was tied to the deal that we had with that specific DSP. We obviously can't discuss specific terms of deals, but we'll reiterate that it was a unique situation. And as Steve had said the economics are now operating within a very narrow band. And just as a reminder, we will lapse this when we get to Q1 in 2023 on a comparable basis. So we'll see the growth rate return to a more normalized level reflecting the underlying resumption of business.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Got it. And I guess more broadly when you think about these new revenue streams. You mentioned these are buyout deals right now and they might move to consumption-based models over time and that drives growth of course. But as of now, when some of these platforms, like Peloton being an example or Facebook being an example, when there's some kind of a growth impact on these assets, does that have any correlation to the kind of revenues we see from these assets or because they are buyouts, I mean, they're largely isolated from these impacts? Thanks.\nLou Dickler: Yes. The buyout deals that we do, the economics of this deal should approximate usage on the services. To the extent we shift to a consumption-based model, the revenue recognition might be more linear but we should still see an improvement in economics regardless of the method with which we're paid and how they report to us.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vijay Jayant, Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nVijay Jayant: Hi, it's  for Vijay. I just had two questions. Can you share any color about what you're seeing in terms of paid music subscription growth across the industry based on internal data you see and maybe how its growth currently pacing versus pre - COVID levels? And my second question was, over the past few quarters, there's been a lot of music assets between catalogs and NB labels that have come to the market, how do you evaluate potential assets, you may want to buy and maybe specifically kind of what made the two assets you purchased compelling versus some of the other assets that came to the market over that time frame.\nSteve Cooper: Lou, why don't I take the second and then you can take the first? We look at deals all the time, David (ph). We have a steady, steady flow. When we evaluate deals, we look at what the asking price is. And we look at what we know we can do with that organization of those assets once we get our hands on them. We are not financial buyers. We buy because we are operators and we know how to take these organizations or assets and activate them in ways that are different than the ways they are currently being activated. So when we look at any particular asset, we are able to determine for lack of a better word, how much headroom we have by way of enhancing the performance of those assets. Where we see assets that don't have headroom and have these wild asking prices, we take a pass when we see assets going concern or catalog and we evaluate how they have been managed versus how they could be managed.  And we conclude that there is substantial headroom. And we can align what we pay with the appropriate return on investment we buy, but we pass on for more deals obviously, than we choose to close on. Because we're not inclined to get into options and prove that we have the biggest checkbook in town. We are inclined solely to buy at the right price for the right reasons and take and supercharge the assets that we close on. That's how we have operated for the last decade. That's how we continue to operate as we go forward. We invest, we don't speculate.\nLou Dickler: And then just on streaming subscriber growth question, we like the fundamentals of streaming, we think they're very strong. We're confident in the long-term growth of streaming platforms and subscription. When you look at penetration across both emerging and developed markets, there's tremendous opportunity for further penetration that will drive growth. So we think that there's a lot of room here and we're coming about the long-term growth of the business. You know, the other thing that obviously has been talked about, and Spotify has released some information around their ARPU. We obviously have internal metrics around ARPU. We've seen some increases in ARPU and obviously to the extent that there's pricing increases that would further benefit us.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bazinet with Citi. Your line is open.\nJason Bazinet: Thanks. I think it's about two years ago when you guys spoke about your view of monetization on the ad-supported streaming services. You felt like maybe you weren't getting paid a fair level. And I just wondered, in the intervening two years, do you feel like these ad-supported services have sort of harmonized or where you feel like you're getting paid appropriate level -- appropriate compensation for an ad-supported stream? Or is there still potential to rectify that? Thanks.\nSteve Cooper: Well, we're doing several things. Number one, where we believe rates are inadequate, we continue to negotiate for what we believe to be appropriate splits. But more importantly, with WMX, we have unified our approach to the ad markets. We have been able to consolidate across all of our businesses as a result of that unification, an approach that brings our entire portfolio of artists and music to potential advertisers. And we have been able to -- on a global basis and in organizationally, we're able to match better match the needs of the advertisers with the treasure chest that we have in our portfolio of music.  So I have every expectation that the goals that we are setting internally for the growth of our ad revenue and the growth of our ad presence will be that by taking this laser-like approach to the market. So I think on both sides, a through negotiating specific deals, but more importantly through the reorganization of WEA into WMX. I'm confident we'll see a very nice return on that reorganization in that laser like focus on the ad market.\nJason Bazinet: And can I just ask one follow-up? When you see the reorganization of WMX, it's essentially just putting more of your talent under one umbrella and selling it holistically. Is that the nature of your reorganization?\nSteve Cooper: It is essentially creating a centralized service that deals as the interface between ad buyer's needs and how we can satisfy those needs. This is now a worldwide service that is coordinated and focused through a highly motivated, highly skilled, centralized organization.\nJason Bazinet: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question from Matthew Thornton with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nMatthew Thornton: Hey, good morning, Steve. Good morning, Lou. Maybe two if I could, I guess just coming back to the renewed deal with the digital partner, the $28 million without getting into specifics, is there any benefit that you're getting from the renewed deal? Maybe there's promotion or whatever it might be or is this really just -- this particular DSP was a little bit outside of the band and they're being brought inside the band. I'm just curious if there's any benefit to Warner. Yeah, maybe on the other side from this deal.  And then just secondly, can you talk a little bit about linearity for the year? Obviously, the first quarter is off to a good start. But when you think about the content slate for the year or investments you're making, anything you'd call out as we think about linearity for the year. And Lou, hand-in-hand with that, I don't know if you have any thoughts or estimates on what you expect currency headwind to be for the year versus maybe organic contribution to revenue growth for the year. Thanks, guys.\nSteve Cooper: So,\nLou Dickler: \nSteve Cooper: Yeah, go ahead, Lou. Go ahead.\nLou Dickler: I was just going to answer the first question quickly on the deal. It was outside of the band and now it's inside the band. So that's the answer to that one, and we obviously don't talk about specifics. Steve, over to you.\nSteve Cooper: When we look at the rest of the year, we think we've established nice momentum. We believe that, as mentioned in the remarks, we've got a lot of great music coming. And while I can't draw an arc, a line, or a curve for use to what that's going to translate to, I am feeling comfortable that we will deliver what we've historically committed to deliver this year.\nOperator: Thank you.\nSteve Cooper:  Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And I would now like to turn the call back over to Steve Cooper for closing remarks.\nSteve Cooper: Thanks again today, everyone, for your time. We appreciate you joining us on these calls and it's always -- we appreciate your ongoing support. We will talk in a few months, and hopefully, my confidence in our momentum will be born out. Anyway, I hope everyone enjoys the balance of the Lunar New Year. Have a wonderful Valentine\u2019s Day. Have a wonderful rest of the winter and stay safe. Thanks, everybody. Bye-bye.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Lou Dickler",
            "content": "Thank you, Steve. And good morning, everyone. Our Q1 results are highlighted by record high revenue across the board since we became a stand-alone company in 2004. These results were driven by growth in traditional and emerging streaming platforms, as well as continued recovery in physical and artist services, all of which underpin the continued momentum across our business. Before I get into our results, I'd like to highlight an item that affected compatibility this quarter. Q1 includes the benefit of an additional week of operating performance versus the prior year quarter. Due to the timing of our 52/53 week financial calendar, the additional week fell in December 2021. And as a result, this fiscal quarter is a 14-week quarter versus the standard 13-week quarter in the prior year.  This additional week primarily benefited our recorded music streaming revenue and will only impact Q1 as all of the subsequent quarters in fiscal '22 are 13 weeks, consistent with the prior-year. Moving now to our results, total revenue increased by over 22% on a constant currency basis and 21% on an as-reported basis, reflecting strong performance in both recorded music and music publishing. Starting this quarter, we will break out streaming revenue for each of recorded music and music publishing and we will report revenue from emerging streaming platforms through Recorded Music and Music Publishing on a combined basis. Total streaming revenue increased 24% driven by growth across both segments.  This strong operating performance translated to impressive adjusted OIBDA growth of 26% with margins improving from 21.1% to 22%. Our margin growth is particularly notable given the continued strong recovery in lower-margin revenue lines, such as artist services. Adjusted EBITDA grew 31% with margins improving from 22.2% to 24.1%. Also driven by strong operating performance and the pro forma impact of future cost savings and the transactions we closed in the quarter. You can find the calculations and reconciliations related to adjusted OIBDA and adjusted EBITDA in our press release. Recorded Music revenue grew 21%, underpinned by growth across all revenue lines. Streaming revenue increased by 22%, driven by growth in subscription, ad supported, and emerging streaming platforms. As I noted earlier, these results also benefited from the additional week in December and were partially offset by the impact of a new deal with one of our DSP partners, which began at the start of fiscal 2022. Adjusting for the net impact of the additional week, which was $60 million, and the new DSP deal, which was $28 million, our recorded music streaming revenue would have grown by approximately 18% while this new DSP deal is now consistent with our other major DSP deals.  We are seeing a variance relative to the prior deal, which will result in similar impact on year-over-year comparisons that will extend throughout the remainder of fiscal '22. We fully expect to see a normalization of our recording music streaming growth rate commencing in Q1 2023. Artist services and expanded rights revenue, which includes merchandising, grew by over 33%, reflecting an increase in merchandising and concert promotion revenue as touring has resumed. Physical revenue grew by 14%, primarily driven by strong new releases and a worldwide demand for vinyl. Licensing revenue increased by 13% mainly due to higher synchronization and other licensing revenue as businesses continued to recover from COVID disruption. Adjusted OIBDA was $336 million, a 22% increase over the prior year quarter with margins improving to 24.2%. This growth was driven by strong operating performance across all revenue lines.  Music Publishing had a record quarter as well posting revenue of $229 million, a growth rate of 32% over the prior year quarter, reflecting double-digit growth across all revenue lines. Digital led the way with revenue growth of over 34% driven by streaming growth of 36% reflecting strength across traditional and emerging platforms. Sync revenue increased over 31% due to higher television, motion picture, and commercial income in the quarter and COVID disruption in the prior year quarter. Growth performance in mechanical revenue increased by 27% as businesses continue to recover from COVID disruption with mechanical benefiting from strong physical sales. Music publishing adjusted OIBDA increased 38% to $55 million, while margin increased 1.1% points to 24%. This increase in adjusted OIBDA margin was primarily due to strong operating performance.  As mentioned on our last call, we still expect to see elevated full-year CapEx in the range of $130 million to a $135 million. In Q1, CapEx increased to $34 million as compared to $18 million in the prior-year quarter, mainly due to the investments in IT infrastructure and the expansion of our E and P facilities to address the strong demand in our e-commerce business. Our financial transformation program remains on track and is expected to deliver annualized run rate savings of about $35 million to $40 million once fully implemented starting in fiscal year 2023. Operating cash flow decreased 24% to $129 million from $169 million. The decline was largely driven by continued A&R investment in the timing of working capital. Free cash flow decreased 37% to $95 million from $151 million in the prior year quarter. As of December 31, we had a cash balance of $450 million, total debt of $3.85 billion and net debt of $3.4 billion. Since our IPO, we have continued to actively manage our capital structure, further reducing our weighted average cost of debt from 4% to 3.2% and extending maturities with our nearest maturity date now in 2028.  And earlier this morning, we announced that we will be issuing our next quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share. As we look ahead, our business has more growth drivers than ever before, whether in recorded music where we continue to see growth in traditional and emerging streaming, acceleration in safe and the return of artist services in vital and at Warner Chappell now the performance is stabilizing and streaming and Sync are surging. This diversification gives us more confidence than ever that we're well-positioned for continued strong growth. We are truly excited about the steady flow of great new music we have in store and look forward to an amazing remainder of the year. Thank you for joining our call today, and we will now open the call for questions. So Michael, on the first question, with regard to the DSP renewal, this is a short-term financial anomaly. It really understates the strength of streaming that we're seeing at Warner. All the deals we have with our global DSP snow fall within a very tight end, and the oddity of the comparison that we're seeing, and that's created one exist beyond fiscal 2022. We're incredibly confident that traditional -- both traditional and emerging platforms will continue to experience strong growth. And as a result, our 2022 and beyond  have changed. So since our IPO, we have seen significant growth across emerging streaming platforms in social and fitness. As you mentioned because of the nature of those deals, a lot of them are buyout deals, not consumption-based, the revenue patterns can be at times a bit step as opposed to linear. Obviously as those services mature and they go to consumption model that will convert to a more linear pattern. We are expecting stable growth to continue within emerging streaming platform through the balance of the year. And as we -- Steve mentioned and you alluded to, we do see enormous long-term potential is Web3 scales. And we see opportunities in collectibles entities, another Web3 opportunities. Thank you. From a margin perspective, obviously we did see some margin expansion as we move through COVID. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, is that lower-margin revenue returned. We did see some margin compression in the period, although we're still able to deliver strong margin for the quarter, an increase in margin year-over-year. Long term, we expect the revenue mix and the continued growth in streaming, including emerging streaming platforms to contribute nicely to margin expansion. We also have the cost-savings initiatives we've talked about around fit and otherwise, which will drive margin improvement. We obviously did too material deals at the end of December with 300 Entertainment and David Bowie Publishing Catalog. We think there's a lot of growth potential within those assets and also some operating efficiencies because this closed laden in the quarter, we're not seeing the impact of those within the quarter in the December. But obviously, when we get to March, we'll start to see that flow through. And because those are accretive deals, they will help margin expansion nicely. Thank you. Yeah, the -- The expansion -- the growth in emerging streaming sequentially included both growth in Recorded Music and Music Publishing. On the DSP item, the 28 that you've quoted it was unrelated to the impact of podcasting. It was tied to the deal that we had with that specific DSP. We obviously can't discuss specific terms of deals, but we'll reiterate that it was a unique situation. And as Steve had said the economics are now operating within a very narrow band. And just as a reminder, we will lapse this when we get to Q1 in 2023 on a comparable basis. So we'll see the growth rate return to a more normalized level reflecting the underlying resumption of business. Yes. The buyout deals that we do, the economics of this deal should approximate usage on the services. To the extent we shift to a consumption-based model, the revenue recognition might be more linear but we should still see an improvement in economics regardless of the method with which we're paid and how they report to us. And then just on streaming subscriber growth question, we like the fundamentals of streaming, we think they're very strong. We're confident in the long-term growth of streaming platforms and subscription. When you look at penetration across both emerging and developed markets, there's tremendous opportunity for further penetration that will drive growth. So we think that there's a lot of room here and we're coming about the long-term growth of the business. You know, the other thing that obviously has been talked about, and Spotify has released some information around their ARPU. We obviously have internal metrics around ARPU. We've seen some increases in ARPU and obviously to the extent that there's pricing increases that would further benefit us. Steve Cooper: Yeah, go ahead, Lou. Go ahead. I was just going to answer the first question quickly on the deal. It was outside of the band and now it's inside the band. So that's the answer to that one, and we obviously don't talk about specifics. Steve, over to you."

            "content": "Thanks, Kareem. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. When we spoke last in mid-November, I indicated to you that we would have a productive end to 2021. The last few months have met those expectations. And as a result, we're off to a great start in fiscal'22. In Q1, our total revenue was $1.6 billion, an all-time high during our 18 years as a stand-alone company. We saw growth over the prior year quarter by 21% and 22% on and as-reported in constant-currency basis, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA was $389 million, an increase of 31% with margin improvement driven by strong revenue growth in both our recorded music and publishing businesses. In Recorded Music, our revenue was nearly $1.4 billion, another 18-year record, an increase of 21% from the prior year quarter.  Streaming revenue grew 22%, artist services and physical continued to show impressive recovery with revenue growth of 33% and 14% respectively. Licensing revenue grew 13%. In Publishing, we delivered revenue of $229 million and a growth of 32% over the prior year quarter driven by double-digit increases across all revenue lines while the quarterly revenue and year-over-year growth also represent record highs. I've regularly highlighted our increasing focus on revenue from emerging streaming platforms in areas like social, fitness, and gaming. Until now, we've been reporting this revenue only for recorded music. Going forward, we will report this revenue for recorded music and for publishing on a combined basis.  On an annualized basis, this revenue increased from $310 million in Q4 to $325 million in Q1 driven by growth in recorded music and publishing. Our approach to music is all about expanding our universe of opportunities. We are constantly seeking innovative openings to bring more music to more people in more ways and in more places. The agility and imagination with which we maximize the value of our music sets us apart from our competitors. Right now, a lot of money is being thrown at music as a so-called asset class. In this environment, artists, songwriters and tech entrepreneurs have many different options for building their businesses and brands. We're being recognized for our unique position in this growing music ecosystem. Our creative expertise, our global infrastructure, our willingness to experiment, give us our strength, and give us our edge.  While taking risk is part of our business, we pride ourselves on taking educated risks across a wide investment portfolio with the financially disciplined, ROI-focused perspective. Toward the end of the calendar year, we completed several strategic acquisitions that reflect our approach. We acquired 300 Entertainment, one of the most influential labels to emerge in the 21st century. It has developed a distinctive identity and a dynamic community of arts. We are honored to welcome to the Warner Music Group Megan Thee Stallion, Young Thug, , Mary J. Blige and many more. 300 shares the independent spirit that's always been part of Warner story, our DNA, and our vision. With this deal Kevin Lyles, who co-founded 300, became the Chairman and CEO of both 300 and our Elektra Music Group. We also acquired the required for rights to David Bowie's entire publishing ADA log in compassing hundreds of songs across this revolutionary six decade period.  Three months earlier, we closed a first -- a new licensing deal, David Bowie's recorded music very well. We're now home to this incredible body of work as both of recording artist and songwriter. And in a deal that makes us one of the biggest music distributors in Africa, we acquired a majority stake in Africori, the continent's leading artist development, rights management, and digital distribution company. Last year, Africori reported strong revenue growth across all major guest piece through the generation of hundreds of millions of audio streams and billions of YouTube views. These deals are already producing dividends. Gunna's new album on 300 Entertainment DS4Ever landed at number one on the Billboard 200, giving him his second chart topper.  And just a month after our Bowie acquisition, Peloton introduced the David Bowie collection, which makes every release in his catalog available for Peloton users as the soundtrack to their workouts. 300, Bowie and Africori bolster are already incredible roster of artists and songwriters. Our star power was on full display when this year's Grammy nominations were announced. Electric's Brandi Carlile, and Atlantic Silk Sonic, both received multiple nominations. Also landing in the top categories were Atlantic's Ed Sheeran, for song of the year and Warner Records Sweetie for best new artist.  In Publishing, we received numerous nominations, including song of the year and best wrap and country songs among many others. We bring original artists and inspiring songwriters of every genre, geography, and generation to the world stage. We're a place where quality and diversity matter. That's the mindset behind our constant, ever-growing flow of great new music. In Q1, we saw the chart topping album, chart topping return album, some stars like Kodak Black and Roddy Ricch, as well as strong carryover performances from Ed Sheeran and Cold Blood. Latin American artists Tiago PZK, and Petro  have set social media on fire with hundreds of thousands of TikTok videos having been created from their hit songs. With over 800 million on demand audio and video streams combined, Dua Lipa's Levitating was the most stream song of 2021 in the U.S. and was the number 1 song of year on billboards year-end singles chart. Atlantic's rising star, Gail, has racked up over 3 million TikTok video creations and half a billion streams from her debut single. South Africa's CKay continue to hit new peaks with multiple versions of his global smash, Love Nwantiti, which has surpassed 600 million screens, more than triple what I've reported on our last call.  Meanwhile, Warner Chappell continued its impressive run, signing key deals with Cardi B and R&B icon Jhene\u0301 Aiko, and partnering on a new deal with Tim & Danny Music to sign Sam Smith. Warner Chappell Warner Chappell national landed BMI publisher of the year for the fourth consecutive year, and took home CSX publisher of the year accolade. It's second win in three years. Warner Chappell was also number one on billboards year-end Latin publisher chart for the fourth year in a row, and ranked second on billboards year-end at 100 publishers list. Music is no longer linear, transactional or limited by format. It's complex, multifaceted, and interactive.  The intersection of virtual social spaces, gaming and music presents enormous opportunities to engage with massive and diverse audiences. We're leaning in and taking control of our future through a series of strategic partnerships, collaborations, and investments. We kicked off the year with collaborations with some of the biggest names in this space. Roblox featured David Guetta in the first-ever DJ set performed by an avatar. On Fortnite, Tones and I, brought hits from her debut chart topping album to the platform Soundwave Series. Meanwhile, Silk Sonic joined the platform's Icon Series, allowing players to express themselves as the Grammy nominated duo with '70s inspired outfits and accessories and to discover music through the new icon radio station.  From collectibles to music royalties, Web3 represents an exciting future for the music industry that will help our artists to reach millions upon millions of new fans in interesting and innovative ways. Since our investment in Dapper Labs in 2019, been consistently investing, building, and partnering in Web3 opportunities. We're continuing in this direction at an even faster clip in 2022. In January alone, we launched three important partnerships in the Web3 space. We partnered with one of, the company backed by music legend Quincy Jones. We'll be collaborating to create artist NFTs using their eco -friendly green Web3 platform. We announced the first major music partnership with the Digital's Collectible Platform, Block party.  Our initial collaboration is with the Venus superstars . We also became the first major music company to partner with the Sandbox. We'll be working with them to build out WMG land, a space where fans will be able to connect with their favorite artist through virtual experiences in NFT's. We've been talking to you for several quarters now, above our differentiated dynamic range of artist and label services, covering everything from streaming, to merge, to branded content in IRR. The strategy was crystallized late last year when we unveiled WMX, giving this important segment of our business a fresh look and unified approach. WMX brings together a culturally curious audience of music lovers that currently totals more than a quarter of a billion monthly unique visitors. These connections are driven by our wholly-owned media brands, UPROXX, Songkick, and HipHopDX.  WMX is right by Comscore among the top five video media companies, for 18 to 34 year-old audiences in the United States. It generates almost 50 billion monthly views on our premium YouTube channels, as well as other streaming and social media platforms. WMX is helping to differentiate us in our mission to attract and amplify original artists by building broader and deeper fan bases. As you all know, there is a growing wave of interest in what companies are doing about important environmental, social, and governance issues. To us, continuing to become a more equitable and sustainable company, there's moral, commercial, and creative imperative. This is something we've been passionate about for many years, and we've taken important steps since we hired Samantha Sims as our head of ESG back in August. Last week, we released our inaugural ESG report, which can be found on our website.  The report outlines how we believe we can more effectively address social and environmental challenges our global society is facing. Along with details about our north star DEI commitments, the report also highlights some of our initial accomplishments related to fighting climate change, producing more sustainable products, and other important initiatives. We recently announced the third round of grant recipients from the Warner Music Group, or Blavatnik Family Foundation Social Justice Fund. Since the fund was announced in June 2020, it has pledged $22.5 million to two dozen organizations. It's contributions continue to reflect at the fund strategic pillars, criminal justice reform, education, and arts and culture. While also addressing the intersection of race in gender and equity. We view all these initiatives as long-term commitments to action and accountability and we're excited about the path we're on. Before I pass the mic to Lou, I have some good news about the return of our CFO, Eric Levin.  As you are all aware, Eric has been out of medical leave since November and we're happy and excited as he'll be rejoining us as CFO next week. Many, many thanks to Lou for the amazing job that he's been doing as acting CFO, in addition to his important responsibilities as our SVP and Corporate Controller. We couldn't be more enthusiastic about the amazing new music we have in store this year from our talented artists and songwriters. Even so Cardi B, Jack Harlow, Bella Porch, and many, many others are going to be back with really great new music. We're more convinced than ever that Web3 will be one of the next steps in the evolution of the music  system. As the global entertainment economy continues to change at light speed. Major music companies are the only ones with the skill sets, the global footprint, and the financial resources to fully support artists and songwriters. At the Warner Music Group, we're unrelenting champions of the incredible work of our artists and songwriters, and fierce advocates for their rights as creators. So, again, thank you to everyone in our company who makes this possible, and thank you to our shareholders for your continued support. With that, I'll hand it over to Lou. Great. So let me see if I can deal with the Spotify issue or issues that you raised Michael. First of all, just to be clear, Neil Young, Jimmie Nicol, Crosby, Stills & Nash are legendary artists. And as such, they continue to have an amazing impact on culture after more than 50 years of creating wonderful, wonderful music. Our first inclination is to always support our artists and it is good to see that Spotify was responding to this issue in an attempt to resolve it, but they should be the ones that speak about their own positions and there, call it signals. We do trust to be crystal clear. We do business with hundreds of streaming operations around the world not only traditional streamers, but these new emerging business platforms. And we and our artists broadly speaking feel very good about those revenue streams that are generated many on a consumption basis. And we, the Warner Music Group, as I mentioned in my remarks, continue to fight day and night for our artists and songwriters to ensure that they are compensated for their work and is equitable a fashion as possible. No. As Lou mentioned, virtually all of our deals fall within a very tight fan of economics. And when you look at Spotify, they are in the process of building, as Daniel Ek announced several years ago, a podcast business. The economics of that business are different than the economic relationship that we have with Spotify on the music side. Sure. Lou, why don't you take the first part and then I'll take the second part. Great. Before I address Web3, let me just say that we've been very consistent with respect to traditional streaming, both in mature markets and in emerging markets. We still see tremendous potential for growth. When you look at the subscriptions relative to the smart device population, when you look at the nascent trend of raising prices that are sticking all of these put us on markers that say these areas will continue to enjoy very, very nice growth for the foreseeable future. We see the slim opportunities albeit as new points out. In many of these emerging models, they have -- at least at the moment, they lean more towards buyouts in consumption.  But we continue to see new models coming to market every day. We continue to see those models that have been in the market for a year or two continue to grow. And so we are confident that on what we would now describe as the more traditional side to the business that long-term sustained growth is in our view quite profitable.  With respect to Web3, which is a broad way of talking about blockchain, crypto, NFT is a form of crypto and so on, we see not only the beginning of interactive models coming to the surface and beginning to engage fandom around the world, but we think there are going to be more opportunities than we can even imagine as I'm sitting here in my kitchen today. I will say this, I think that the emergence of Web3 is going to further amplify the importance of music labels and publishers.  This is an area between models that will emerge, the technology of blockchain, the perils of navigating crypto, the skill sets required to deal with distributed autonomous organizations will require organizations like us that have the financial resources, the intellectual capital, by that I mean the specific skill sets, and the global footprint to be able to help our artists and songwriters not only navigate through this brave new world or brave new universe, but navigate successfully in order to optimize their presence inside the world of Web3 and to optimize their revenue options and their revenue alternatives inside of Web3. So I think labels and publishers will be more important than they are today as the world becomes more and more complex. I don't believe that when I look at individual artist managers -- their agents, that they will be able to be as successful as they can be, unless they navigate these move but very interesting waters with Warner Music and others like us. Lou, why don't I take the capital allocation and then you can take the margins. Thanks for your questions by the way. With respect to capital allocation, our philosophy remains the same albeit it gets refined at the edges from time to time. We still look first to reinvest in the business and that reinvestment in the business falls into several pockets. One is to invest in identifying new artists, new songwriters, their songs and their music, and we will continue to invest assertively in our core business to ensure a constant and ever-growing flow of new artists and new music. We are also investing heavily in our internal infrastructures because we are committed to be, and we are well on our way by being an immersive, tech enabled 21st Century digital company.  And in order to achieve that goal, we have to provide our organization with the appropriate tools whether it's the self-serving, well organized data oceans, whether it'd be robotics, whether it be the digitization of processes, we have to have those tools to reach our goals and to enhance and support the decision-making of our people that already utilize good judgment, financial discipline, and are accountable for these choices. So our internal capital allocation remain the same. Externally, we will continue to look for opportunities where we believe that between the opportunity, what we have to pay, the desire that the immediately accretive, and our long-term ability to grow those acquisitions. We will continue also in that area to be quite assertive with respect to investing in these technologies, some of which we discussed in our prepared remarks.  We are committed to be on the leading edge of change within our segment of the music ecosystem. And if you look at our investment strategy, we intend to be first at point a, first at point B, first at point C because we want to create our future. We don't want to follow somebody else into it, and that philosophy is also going to continue to prevail. Lou, why don't you cover the margin issue. Lou, why don't I take the second and then you can take the first? We look at deals all the time, David (ph). We have a steady, steady flow. When we evaluate deals, we look at what the asking price is. And we look at what we know we can do with that organization of those assets once we get our hands on them. We are not financial buyers. We buy because we are operators and we know how to take these organizations or assets and activate them in ways that are different than the ways they are currently being activated. So when we look at any particular asset, we are able to determine for lack of a better word, how much headroom we have by way of enhancing the performance of those assets. Where we see assets that don't have headroom and have these wild asking prices, we take a pass when we see assets going concern or catalog and we evaluate how they have been managed versus how they could be managed.  And we conclude that there is substantial headroom. And we can align what we pay with the appropriate return on investment we buy, but we pass on for more deals obviously, than we choose to close on. Because we're not inclined to get into options and prove that we have the biggest checkbook in town. We are inclined solely to buy at the right price for the right reasons and take and supercharge the assets that we close on. That's how we have operated for the last decade. That's how we continue to operate as we go forward. We invest, we don't speculate. Well, we're doing several things. Number one, where we believe rates are inadequate, we continue to negotiate for what we believe to be appropriate splits. But more importantly, with WMX, we have unified our approach to the ad markets. We have been able to consolidate across all of our businesses as a result of that unification, an approach that brings our entire portfolio of artists and music to potential advertisers. And we have been able to -- on a global basis and in organizationally, we're able to match better match the needs of the advertisers with the treasure chest that we have in our portfolio of music.  So I have every expectation that the goals that we are setting internally for the growth of our ad revenue and the growth of our ad presence will be that by taking this laser-like approach to the market. So I think on both sides, a through negotiating specific deals, but more importantly through the reorganization of WEA into WMX. I'm confident we'll see a very nice return on that reorganization in that laser like focus on the ad market. It is essentially creating a centralized service that deals as the interface between ad buyer's needs and how we can satisfy those needs. This is now a worldwide service that is coordinated and focused through a highly motivated, highly skilled, centralized organization. So, When we look at the rest of the year, we think we've established nice momentum. We believe that, as mentioned in the remarks, we've got a lot of great music coming. And while I can't draw an arc, a line, or a curve for use to what that's going to translate to, I am feeling comfortable that we will deliver what we've historically committed to deliver this year. Thank you. Thanks again today, everyone, for your time. We appreciate you joining us on these calls and it's always -- we appreciate your ongoing support. We will talk in a few months, and hopefully, my confidence in our momentum will be born out. Anyway, I hope everyone enjoys the balance of the Lunar New Year. Have a wonderful Valentine's Day. Have a wonderful rest of the winter and stay safe. Thanks, everybody. Bye-bye."

At the request of Warner Music Group, today's call is being recorded for replay purposes, and if you object, you may disconnect at any time. Now I would like to turn today's call over to your host, Mr. Kareem Chin, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nKareem Chin: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Warner Music Group's fiscal fourth quarter and full year earnings conference call. Please note that our earnings press release and earnings snapshot are available on our website and we plan to file our Form 10-K during the week of November 20. On today's call, we have our CEO, Robert Kyncl; and our CFO, Bryan Castellani, who will take you through our results. They will then be joined by Eric Levin for the Q&A portion of the call.

Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in our filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll turn it over to Robert.\nRobert Kyncl: Thanks, Kareem, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to warmly welcome Bryan Castellani, who joined us as CFO last month. Bryan spent more than two decades at Disney, most recently as CFO of Disney Entertainment and ESPN. We're excited he's part of our team now. I'd like to say a heartfelt thank you to Eric Levin, who's been our CFO for the past nine years. Eric has brought smart steady financial leadership to WMG during a transformational period for the industry and our company. Given this quarter was his last the CFO, who will be available for Q&A. I have no doubt you'll join me in wishing him the very best as he moves into retirement in January. I'm happy to say our Q4 performance continued to deliver on the second half improvement that we promised on our Q1 earnings call. Led by an acceleration in our streaming revenue, Q4 revenue and adjusted OIBDA grew 5% and 18%, respectively. We also saw robust margin expansion of 230 basis points. For the full year, we reached a key milestone in eclipsing $6 billion of revenue for the first time ever. Our revenue and adjusted OIBDA grew 4% and 10%, respectively, and we delivered 120 basis points of margin expansion. Importantly, operating cash flow conversion was 56% of adjusted OIBDA. With industry tailwinds at our back and a solid slate of new music to start the year, we've headed into fiscal '24 with strong momentum. As always, everything we accomplished begins with our amazingly talented artists and songwriters. In recorded music, the diversity of our artist roster was showcased by a range of success stories from the global phenomenon of the Barbie soundtrack to the breakthrough countries superstar, Zach Ryan, with whom we also signed for publishing this year. Warner Records artist, Kenya Grace, scored a global hit with strangers, which rose number one on Billboard\u2019s Dance and Electronic chart. In the U.K., we celebrated the number one albums from Ed Sheeran, Bernard Boy, Lar and Liam Gallagher. And in Japan, MiSaMo made up of members of the super group Twice its number one with their first album. We continue to bolster our local success in multiple territories across the globe. We have number one hit by Gabz in Denmark, Kjartan Lauritzen in Norway. AIVA, ANA and CapoPlaza in Italy; Elva Hsiao in China; and Jasleen Royal in India just to name a few. At the same time, we brought bold inventive thinking to attracting new fans to our legendary artists and classic recordings. Recent examples included a new deluxe edition of talking had stopped making sense. The 15th anniversary of Slipknot\u2019s All Hope is Gone and the 20th anniversary of Linkin Park Meteora. With Madonna on tour, it's been a pleasure to find new ways to create cultural moments around her iconic career. These include a series of remix albums, the special pride edition of her box at containing 15 number one tracks and the celebratory viral campaign We Love Madonna. In Music Publishing, our powerful momentum continues as Warner Chappell writers contributed to 8 out of 14 Billboard number one spots in Q4, including Zach Ryan, I Remember Everything and Last Night by Morgan Wallen. We're always expanding our publishing roster and have recently signed hotly contested deals with up-and-coming stars Kaliii and Laufey and Maria Becerra. We're always reinvigorating our incredible publishing catalog, which includes evergreen copyrights from composers such as George Michael, who was just inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Gamble and Huff, Van Morrison and Stephen Sondheim. As we speak, there are three Sondheim musicals running in New York, including a revival of Sweeney Todd, starting Warner record star Josh Groben, which was just nominated for a gram. Looking forward to a new fiscal year, I'm even more optimistic than I was when I started. We're excited about the trends we're seeing in the industry and energized by our plans to capitalize on them. Let's start with the industry. Advanced repeating, music is the most popular form of entertainment and it's only getting bigger. Our addressable market encompasses virtually everyone on the planet. Growth in the music business is now well aligned with the opportunities constantly being created by the ongoing global penetration of smartphones and Internet service. Ever since I arrived at WMG, I've been laser-focused on how we can realize the true value of music. I'm grateful to all of our partners who are leaning in and figuring out how we make positive changes together. We're taking a two-pronged approach. First, price optimization, I see this as the most immediate and impactful growth lever for our industry. A more sophisticated and dynamic approach to consumer pricing will benefit the streaming platforms, music companies, artists and songwriters, the entire ecosystem, driving greater investment and innovation. In the last year, we've seen the first round of subscription price increases across every major DSP and we strongly believe there is a greater pricing opportunity in the future. Second, the evolution of royalty models, we've been consistently clear that streaming services should ascribe more value to what their customers value most. It's the creativity of popular artists and songwriters that deliver subscriber engagement and growth. To state the obvious, premium music should be better compensated than low-quality filler or functional music. We were delighted to work with Deezer to help shape their new approach to rewarding premium music. Look out for similar developments with other partners in the coming months. While these proof points represent a good start, they are just that. We will continue to work collaboratively with our partners to align behind the long-term growth of the industry. I just told you why we're excited about the music industry. Now let me explain why we're excited about Warner Music Group specifically. The future of music will be forged at the intersection of creativity and technology. With that in mind, we're carving out a distinctive proposition through the combination of the following. One, a deep iconic catalog as well as up and coming talent and thriving superstars; two, global scale with strong local capabilities and the discovery and promotion of talent; three, the ability to use technology as a force multiplier on the previous two attributes. Our commitment to each of these key areas is always underpinned by our focus on financial discipline, and we're constantly challenging ourselves to operate more efficiently and effectively. As a rule of thumb, our recorded music revenue is evenly split among three release vintages. New releases, which are less than three years old, shallow catalog, which is more than three, but less than 10 years old and deep catalog, which is more than 10 years old. We invest in A&R and marketing across each of these vintages to create a consistent flow of music from our artists and songwriters all around the world, past, present and future. We pride ourselves on discovering original talent and unique voices with long-term potential. We provide them with tailored approaches to become standout global success stories. Think one-of-a-kind genre defying artists like Bruno Mars, Ed Sheeran, Cardi B, Dua Lipa, Zach Ryan and many more. The beauty of the streaming universe is that every time one of our superstars releases a new album or goes on the tour or scores a big same placement, the fan engagement spikes across their entire body of work. Equally, in the world of playlisting and social media and a track from our catalog can go viral at any moment. These big hits from legends like Fleetwood Mac, Boney M and Madonna explode on multiple platforms, introducing these artists to a new generation. For instance, my 20-year-old daughter discovered Fleetwood Mac when their 1977 hit dreams went viral on TikTok two years ago. They are now her favorite band of all time. To fuel, maximize and monetize this uplift in engagement requires real expertise and a wide network of relationships. This is how we demonstrate our value and our relevance in the entertainment ecosystem, not just by discovering talent and promoting their latest works but by thinking holistically about their careers and growing their legacies. Our entrepreneurial culture extends to how we select which companies to invest in or acquire. A perfect example is our new venture with 10K projects, which brings us a dynamic artist roster, fresh catalog and a visionary team led by Elliott Branch. Investing in our core business is in just about the recordings and compositions that we own. It's also about leveling up our distribution business in ways that delivers profitable growth. We created more capacity for ADA to focus on developing new distribution partnerships and for our technology team to build scalable solutions to enable these partnerships. In the last year, we signed deals with a range of labels, including Australia's last ride records, the U.K.'s LAB records and the U.S. Rostrum records which launched the careers of hip-hop stars like Mac Miller and Wiz Khalifa. Let me turn now to our approach to global expansion and emerging markets. For some time now, our goal hasn't been just to market Anglo-American repertoire in local markets. Instead, we signed and develop local talent that can have regional or global success. As I've mentioned before, we're making great inroads in fast-growing territories like China, the Middle East and Africa. India is a great example of this strategy in action. With a vast population of 1.4 billion people and its huge diversity of demographics, India has an endlessly evolving music scene. According to IFDI India has more than doubled its recorded music revenue over the last five years, and it also has the highest growth of any top 20 country in 2022 at 48%. We've made huge strides since first launching our local office in Mumbai in 2020. This year alone, we've grown our presence thereby acquiring e-positive and Indian management and live events company. Launching a new JV, 91 NORTH RECORDS and expanding our partnership with Sky Digital an aggregator of Punjabi music. Our team in India is attracting massive stars, including hip hop artist King who became the first Indian performer to hit Spotify's global top 30. The music ecosystem is healthy and has a number of exciting growth drivers, with price increases happening across all major DSPs, royalty models evolving to reward quality and emerging markets gaining traction. We're very confident and positive about the path ahead. We're excited about our new releases for fiscal '24 and including some that came out just last Friday from David Guetta, Jack Harlow, PinkPantheress, and of course, Dua Lipa, who had her biggest global launch to date with her new single Houdini. There are also eagerly anticipated projects from Green Day, Kenya Grace, Cardigans, Gabby Barrett, Maria Bechara; and Myke Towers among many others. We've been working hard to build a WMG that will excel in the music industry of tomorrow. Our work is already beginning to bear fruit, and I assure you that there is much more excitement to come. And now, here's Bryan to walk you through our financial results.\nBryan Castellani: Thank you, Robert, and good morning, everyone. I am extremely excited to be here, and I'm looking forward to engaging closely with the investment community. In my brief time at Warner Music Group, I've been impressed with the work that we are doing. We are investing in our already strong core and leveraging technology, which will continue to augment our growth through a rapidly changing music industry. We have strong momentum ahead and we'll share regular updates with you as our progress continues. Now turning to our Q4 results, as Robert highlighted, our performance in the quarter was underpinned by a solid release slate and a recovery in ad supported streaming, which drove sequential acceleration in our recorded music streaming growth. This fuels our second half improvement which combined with our disciplined cost management enabled us to deliver robust adjusted EBITDA growth and margin expansion for the full year. There are a couple of items throughout the quarter and the year that affected comparability. These include the impacts from the CRB mechanical royalty rate increase a copyright settlement and an extra reporting week. The details and adjustments relating to these items can be found in our earnings press release. I will provide growth rates in constant currency and normalized for these items. In Q4, total revenue grew 5% and adjusted OIBDA increased 18% and with a margin of 20%, an increase of 230 basis points over the prior year quarter. On a normalized basis, total revenue grew 6% and adjusted OIBDA increased 31% with a margin of 19.9%, an increase of 370 basis points over the prior year quarter. Recorded Music revenue grew 2% and 5% on a normalized basis. Despite a challenging comparison to the prior year quarter, our streaming revenue grew 9% and an improvement from the 7% we reported in Q3. Subscription streaming revenue grew by approximately 10%, representing healthy growth over the 13% we delivered in the prior year quarter and was in line with Q3. Ad-supported revenue increased by 7%. Physical revenue increased 6%, driven by strong performance in the U.S. including from new releases like the Barbie Soundtrack, 50-50, G-idle and Mac Miller. Artist services and expanded rights revenue decreased 11% and -- the decrease was due to lower merchandising revenue in the U.S. tied to timing of touring cycles and economic headwinds in Europe that continue to impact our E&P business. This was partially offset by higher concert promotion revenue. Licensing revenue grew by 7% due to higher broadcast fees. Recorded music adjusted OIBDA grew by 23%, with a margin of 21.8%, an increase of 370 basis points. On a normalized basis, adjusted OIBDA increased by 32% with margin expansion of 450 basis points. Music Publishing continues to deliver impressive results with revenue growth of 15%, driven by strength across all revenue lines. On a normalized basis, revenue grew 13%. Digital revenue increased 19% and streaming revenue increased 26%. On a normalized basis, Digital revenue grew 15% and streaming revenue increased 17%, reflecting the continued growth in streaming and the impact of digital deal renewals. Mechanical and performance revenue increased by 42% and 2%, respectively, while sync revenue increased by 3%, primarily due to stronger performance in the U.S. Music Publishing adjusted EBITDA grew 19% with a margin of 24.8%, an increase of 90 basis points. On a normalized basis, Music Publishing adjusted OIBDA grew 17% with a margin of 24.9%, an increase of 80 basis points. Moving to our full year results. Total revenue grew 4% and adjusted OIBDA grew 10% with a margin of 20.5%, an increase of 120 basis points. On a normalized basis, total revenue grew 6% and adjusted OIBDA grew 17% with a margin of 20.4%, an increase of 190 basis points. We over-delivered our margin expansion guidance even as most of the cost savings from our March restructuring were reinvested to drive our business forward. Recorded music revenue increased 2%. Within Recorded Music streaming revenue increased 4% and adjusted OIBDA grew 7%, with margin expansion of 120 basis points. On a normalized basis, recorded music revenue increased 4% and streaming revenue grew 6% with adjusted OIBDA growth of 13% and margin expansion of 180 basis points. Music Publishing revenue increased 15%, and adjusted OIBDA increased 28% with margin expansion of 270 basis points. On a normalized basis, music publishing revenue increased by 16%, and adjusted OIBDA increased by 28%, with margin expansion of 270 basis points. We continue to successfully launch certain components of our financial transformation program in select territories. The program remains on track to meaningfully roll out later this fiscal year and into FY '25. Once fully implemented, we expect the program to yield annualized run rate savings of $35 million to $40 million. Q4 CapEx of $38 million was the same as the prior year quarter. Q4 operating cash flow decreased 17% and to $338 million from $406 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by working capital items, which included higher royalty advances and the timing of digital deal renewals. Free cash flow decreased 18% to $300 million from $368 million in the prior year quarter. For the full year, operating cash flow decreased 7% to $687 million and free cash flow decreased 8% to $560 million. We delivered operating cash flow conversion with 56% for the full year, in line with our target of 50% to 60% over a multiyear period. As of September 30, we had a cash balance of $641 million, total debt of $4 billion and net debt of $3.3 billion. Our weighted average cost of debt is 4.1% and our nearest maturity date is in 2028. While growth was muted in the first half as we had some release scheduled softness, we recovered to end the year on solid footing and already have momentum in 2024. We are off to a strong start with new releases from Dua Lipa, David Guetta, Jack Harlow, PinkPantheress and many others. As we look ahead to the fiscal Q1, I want to call out a couple of items that will impact comparability. First, we announced that our digital distribution agreement with BMG will end. To frame the impact, the total revenue contribution from BMG in fiscal 2023 and was approximately 4% of total recorded music digital revenue with negligible contribution to adjusted OIBDA. BMG has already started to bring its digital distribution in-house, and it will be largely rolled off by the end of October 2024. The impact to our Q1 24 recorded music digital revenue will be approximately $15 million as both Spotify and Apple will transition this month. This impact will increase in Q2 and beyond as we will see the full quarter impact from the roll-off of these DSPs and as BMG gradually brings other digital partners in-house. We will also discontinue BMG's physical distribution by the end of October 2024. The BMG's physical distribution revenue represented less than 2% of our recorded music revenue in fiscal 2023. We will provide details going forward and disclose normalized growth adjusted for the impact of these items. Second, we have granted a licensing agreement extension for a catalog that will have a onetime favorable impact on recorded music licensing revenue and adjusted OIBDA of approximately $70 million in fiscal Q1 2024. While this is a multiyear licensing agreement extension, the revenue and adjusted OIBDA will be fully recognized in Q1. Our goal is to deliver healthy top line growth margin expansion and cash flow conversion on a consistent basis. 2024 has started with much stronger momentum than we had entering 2023 and we expect our slate throughout the year. We will invest more heavily in A&R and marketing in 2024 to ensure the success of our slate. We still expect to deliver approximately 100 basis points of margin expansion for the full year, which will be back half weighted as well as 50% to 60% of operating cash flow conversion on a multiyear basis, in line with our targets. The momentum in the music entertainment business is strong, and we continue to position ourselves for long-term success and growth. Before I close, I also want to take a moment to thank Eric. His contributions to Warner Music Group and leadership of the finance team have been measurable. I'm grateful for his and the team's support and such a smooth transition. Thank you to everyone for joining us today. We'll now open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Omar Mejias with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nOmar Mejias: Robert, maybe first, I wanted to ask, if you continue to evaluate some of the necessary investments to better position the Company, how do you think about the balance between investment in A&R versus tech? And second, now that you've freed up some resources in ADA, how should we think about your priorities to drive growth and maximize ROI in that business going forward?\nRobert Kyncl: All right. Thanks for the question. So here's the way to think about it. We're a music company that's benefiting from the tailwinds of the music industry that we just described. The way we invest and grow is, first and foremost, into IP, and that has multiple different ways, multiple different forms. One, which is organic ANR, which we do day in day out, investing into new artists or existing audits, and there are new releases. Two, we acquire stakes in going concerns, the acquisition of 10-K is a really good example from a couple of months ago. Three, we acquired catalogs, whether it's on the publishing side, on recorded side, David Boe catalog from a couple of years ago is a good example of that. And then we look at all of these activities all around the world. I just described in the earnings call, our success in many different high-growth markets. So we're replicating all of these activities in different geographies. So it's like a four-pronged approach. Then we layer on top of that investments into technology which becomes a force multiplier on everything I just mentioned. That is the main goal. And what we do with the technology investments are 100% self-funded. That's what we committed to earlier last year, and that's what we are committing to going forward as well. And when we do this, we're creating a flywheel that is allowing us to continue our investments into growth, continue our overall growth, and continue to expand our margins at the same time. That's the strategy for our investment framework. As it relates to ADA and the free up resources, the best way to think about it is -- we have an amazing team of executives that have driven the ADA business for quite a few years. We are focusing on growing both our top line and our bottom line with a very strong global orientation, just again, in line with what I just mentioned earlier and even a minute ago. And we're focused on working with more and more labels and more and more artists all around the world and scaling that business. And technology is a really big part of that because it helps us do that more efficiently and faster and with less friction. And a great example of that is the focus of Ariel's team who runs our technology group to overhaul our supply chain and all of our partner-facing tools that, from a technology standpoint, enables this for the business team to drive acceleration in that business. So all in, the strategy to grow ADA is there as it was before because the independent space is growing, and we're leaning into that space. And two, we're just doing it differently. We're doing it in a way that is driving both top line and bottom line at the same time.\nOmar Mejias: That's very helpful.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.\nBen Swinburne: Welcome Bryan to Warner Music list on the public earnings call to you. Robert, could you talk a little bit about streaming growth recorded music streaming growth as you head into fiscal '24. It would seem between the Spotify price increases, some of the activity in artist-centric and your slate. We should see some acceleration from kind of the exit rate of high single digits that you guys just delivered? That's my first question. And I guess, secondly, I think you called out $10 million of incremental investment in technology in the quarter. I'm sure you will share everything. But can you talk a little bit about where that money is going? And when that might translate into sort of business outcomes that you think we would see externally?\nRobert Kyncl: Sure. Thank you. So, first, on sort of overall streaming growth, obviously, we're pleased with the industry returning to a high. I mean, to a very healthy double-digit growth. The way I think about it is that I'm not really looking at our competitors. I'm not looking at the world around us. I'm focusing on our own continual and sustained improvements. I want our company to just keep on improving on a steady basis and most importantly, on a sustained basis. It's very, very important. The -- obviously, investments into ANR and all of that, that I just mentioned a few minutes ago goes into that. But at the same time, we're investing in technology. And the best way to think about that is there's a lot of foundational work that helps us actually deliver on that sustained growth promise from a technological standpoint. I just mentioned overhauling our supply chain infrastructure. While that may sound very unsexy, the -- what benefits the business is very sexy because it's removing lots of friction and increasing speed in the way we can process more music, more partners, more artists through our supply chain. And so whether it's something that we wholly own or whether it's a partner of ADA with greatly externalized tools and improved tools, all of that contribute towards the growth of the Company while delivering on our margin expansion. So that's just one example on the technology front.\nBryan Castellani: Ben, it's Bryan. Nice to talk to you. I just want to comment on the streaming growth and loop back to my remarks where Q4 over Q4, we had a really strong Q4 '22 and had subscription streaming growth there of 13%. And I think we were 400, 500 basis points above some of our competitors. So that comparison may be muted the quarter a little bit, and we're set up as Robert said, with the second half momentum that we continued and a stronger release slate in '24, particularly in the second half. And so, we feel good about that. And just a reminder on the price increases, that there's a lot that goes into those and those take time to roll through the industry. There's -- from announcement to implementation, geography, product mix, so there's a lot there as it works through our numbers, but we're set up well for '24. Thanks for the question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sebastiano Petti with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSebastiano Petti: Bryan, welcome aboard. Eric, congratulations again on your retirement. Just wanted to ask on the -- Bryan, if you could clarify the margin expansion target for the year. Is that 100 basis points on a reported basis? Or is that ex-BMG? And additionally, just help us think about the phasing. I think you said most of that is back-half weighted, but you do also have a pretty substantial licensing coming through in the first half? So just trying to better understand that. And then a question for Robert. Robert, can you tell us about the AI feature you announced this morning with YouTube and more generally, how you're thinking about AI impacting the industry seems to have been -- become less of a fear than perhaps a couple of quarters ago?\nRobert Kyncl: Sounds good. Bryan, why don't you?\nBryan Castellani: Yes. Sebastiano, thanks. On the margin expansion, as I said in my remarks, that 100 basis points a year target remains for us, and we had a strong over-delivery on an organic basis of a couple of hundred plus basis points in '23. And so that is an organic target ex-BMG for us and that will, particularly as we work through the year, it will be gradual as we work through and get the benefit, I think, of many releases in the second half. And that margin would also be excluding the catalog license sale in Q1. We continue to challenge ourselves in that regard, and we feel good about it as the team continues to be, I think, really active and vigilant cost managers and disciplined on the financial front. So we continue to keep focused on that target.\nRobert Kyncl: Let me take the second part of the question on the beta that was announced this morning with YouTube, the AI beta. So first, I'd like to actually point out to the significance of this, which is imagine in early 2000s, if the file sharing companies came to the music industry and said, would you like to experiment with this new tool that we built and see how it impacts the industry and how we can work together. It would have been incredible. Obviously, that didn't happen. So this is the first time that a large platform at a massive scale, that has new tools at his disposal is proactively reaching out to its partners to test and learn. And I just want to underscore the significance of this kind of engagement and the sort of the orderly fashion in which this is happening. And I really applaud YouTube and DeepMind all of Google and our counterparts in the industry for participating in this because this is the right way to engage this. Whenever I say responsible engagement with our partners, this is precisely what I mean. And so we're excited about it. We're excited to learn from it. And together, we then develop a great blueprint for how things should work, but develop it based on learnings. More broadly, the way I think about our engagement on AI and what we practice is along the following lines. We have three constituents. One, which is degenerative AI engines, right? So whether it's DeepMind, Anthropic, Lambda, et cetera. And there, that's -- obviously, that's where it begins. And there, our efforts in the music industry are focused on making sure that they're licensing content for training, they're keeping records of inputs so that provenance can be tracked and then there's water marketing of the content. The second group is the platforms where most of the content, irrespective of where it will be created and by which tools will end up because people who are creating will want views or streams or lots of user engagement. And with so YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, et cetera, obviously those are the platforms Spotify. We're focused on three things, which is control, attribution and monetization. And all of those wrapped in choice for artists, artist and song writers making sure that they have a choice. And we have a blueprint from all of our work on user-generated content over the past 15 years or so, which created a multibillion-dollar industry on an annual basis for the music industry. So, we just need to now write the fine print for the AIH together with them. And then the third set of constituents is government. And over there, we are both through our trade organizations as well as ourselves working hard to make sure that regulation around AI respects the creative industries, music industry, specifically from our standpoint that licensing for training is required and also that name image likeness and voice is afforded the same protection as copyright. And I, myself, I personally have spent time over the last month with leading politicians on these issues and regulators in London, Brussels, Tokyo and a few others in D.C. and a few other cities around the world. So, lots of effort underway, but I'm really excited and positive about the YouTube beta.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Batya Levi with UBS. Your line is open.\nBatya Levi: Great. Can you provide a bit more color on the recent deals you've signed with the DSPs and some of the benefits you expect to see beyond the price increases we've seen at them? And a second question in terms of acquiring new catalogs. Can you talk what you're seeing in the market right now? We've seen some activity among the smaller labels. What do you think about valuations and availability of new IP?\nRobert Kyncl: Sure. Thank you. So, we obviously don't talk about the details of our DSP agreements. But what I can say on the most recent one, with these, we're really excited to work with them on what was the second prong of our driving the value of music strategy, right? The first prong is price optimization and second one is new royalty models, and that's where this one is falling in. And we again, really like it when we're engaging with our partners. And again, I'm stressing that it's not just one company that you have multiple companies in the industry doing so. That's really, really important because, again, from my experience on the DSP side, if you just have one engaging with you. Yes, it's helpful but not that helpful because you need to scale things appropriately across the ecosystem and the industry, so I'm always focused on the fact that it shouldn't be just us or it shouldn't be just the other guys, it should be multiple large companies, independent as many of us working together, trying to develop better models and drive the value of music. So, we're committed to doing that on multiple fronts. And we want to make sure that the better value for music is reflected. That value is reflected better. And I forgot the second part of the question catalog acquisitions. Yes. I look at catalog as our natural resource in general. It's incredible. The catalog that Warner Music Group has is priceless. It's a gift that keeps on giving. And I use the example of my 20-year-old daughter, who two years ago, discovered Fleetwood Mac and became their biggest fan. That says everything, right? And that is what drives a big, big driver of the value of our company and then all of our efforts to keep on creating new catalogs on new releases and finding new stars that we mentioned. Zach Bryan is an amazing example of that. Obviously, there's been a lot of catalog sales over the last few years that drove up valuations. I think we're starting to see all kinds of fluctuations in that space. And we are very active, and we're watching things in all geographies, and it's a really big part of our focus to make sure that we're opportunistic and strategic at the same time about deploying our capital at the right price where we, through our predictions see a strong and growing performance of the underlying entities.\nBryan Castellani: Yes. And I would just add on that capital allocation that Robert mentioned. And I think he had mentioned it before as well. We were always looking to invest in A&R and new artists and licenses. There's also JVs like 10-K, we can do that through. And then, there is the purchase of catalog that is certainly a big part of our business that we continue to mine and their value continues to grow. And then that's supplemented by marketing and tech investments to for some fuel to grow those returns. But overall, we look at this through the lens of how do we drive our return on invested capital and keeping that and growing in the high teens.\nBatya Levi: That's great. Just a quick follow-up. I think, Robert, last time, you had mentioned that you did not renew with Spotify yet. We seem to think that you have since then, would you be willing to provide an update?\nRobert Kyncl: Yes. So generally, we do not provide updates on timing of our deals. So, I would say speculating on those is probably not the best practice. And there's really nothing to announce. And when, we have something, we will. But there's nothing of note to speak of.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Benjamin Black with Deutsche Bank.\nBenjamin Black: Robert, I just want to go back on your comments around sort of optimized retail pricing. So beyond just broad-based price increases, what would that entail? Are you sort of speaking about the introduction of new tier segments in the market a little bit differently? Sort of how should we interpreting your comments there because you dig into that a little bit? And then my second question is on the advertising side of the business. So what are we seeing in terms of a core music ad supported revenue, if we exclude the impact of some of these new platform deals? And just looking forward, can you sort of talk about the ad market environment and how we should think about ad supported revenue going forward?\nRobert Kyncl: Sure. So when you -- I think it's for price optimization, I think it's really important to sort of broaden the scope of thinking. And I don't mean -- I mean, it's both for our partners as well as for ourselves, the suppliers. And let me give you an example. Aside from, obviously, everything that I said before, which is catch up to inflation, get ahead of inflation, compare yourself to other industries, understand price elasticity, all of those things. So those are sort of basics. And so I'm not going to go back into that. But there are other things to look at for instance the relationship and the ratio of family plan pricing relative to individual plan pricing. Is it at the right place? So even as price increases are happening, is the ratio of these two correct? You can go further widen the aperture further by looking at China. There are no family plans in China. They are only individual accounts. Another example from China is that while you have a subscription on Tencent, certain artists or bands are selling their LPs on top of the subscription. And so, it is so useful to have a really broad aperture on all of these things and not just think myopically through how things happen and only look at the dollars within that. And I'll just give you only two examples. There are others. And there's just so many different ways to think through this. So, I think what's required for that is deep collaboration with our partners and making sure that the changes are win-win for both sides and that we drive the ecosystem up and to the right together at faster rate.\nBryan Castellani: Yes, Ben, it's Bryan. I'll take the ad supported that we're seeing. Definite improvement there, I think everybody is familiar with the first half challenges and advertising recession. And so that rate of growth, that rate of improvement continues. And even without the addition of TikTok, in the combined revenue report there. We'd still be up. We'd still see a good improvement on the rate of change. And so, we like the trends there and are encouraged also encouraged, I think, by -- even with Spotify's remarks were. And that I think as you look across, I think, performance and streaming probably being stronger, performance and targeted advertising in the streaming space being stronger than the larger advertising space. And so, it sets it up well for '24, and we feel good about the outlook there.\nBenjamin Black: Fantastic. And Eric, congrats on the great one wish you all the best in your retirement.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi. Your line is now open.\nJason Bazineta: I really like the way you think about the business in terms of getting the pricing right and finding win-wins with your distribution partners. Where do you think just conceptually where there's the most agreement for a win-win where you sense that there's -- where you are on the same page with your distribution partners? Because I agree with you, there's value there, but I think where The Street is going to struggle is whether or not you can sort of move the needle with new agreements with the DSPs.\nRobert Kyncl: Sure. I think earlier during my opening monologue, I said there's been great progress but it's just a start. And it really is just that. And I feel like we're in the first inning of it. And I'm not saying this because I'm in an earnings call with investors. Actually 100% mean this when I look at the full scope of all the work that needs to be done and the opportunity that is ahead of us. With some partners, we're much further along with others less so. But what you see is that generally, when you make progress with one, others tend to follow in different ways within 12 months. So, we are taking a prioritized approach to this. I think the agreement is that the TAM of the market is probably greater than what we have been thinking about in terms of revenue. And I think the agreement is that other industries have optimized their pricing better than we have. That doesn't mean that we've done anything wrong because we also had to get huge amounts of people into the premium experience and revenue. I think the -- what we have to figure out is how they get wins through this process in a way that it drives wins for us. And that's where there are different ways. And this goes to the aperture broadening a little bit that we have to think through different ways, not just the ways that we've been used to thinking about. And a lot of this work takes -- it takes a while. These things don't happen overnight. But it's important that it begins and then it's done in a deeply analytical fashion because that is what the DSPs will do and that it's done in a collaborative fashion because they need to bring the industry on not just one or two partners. So that's where we're focused on. I just want to close with one last thing to add, which is this weekend, I was just listening to some music on Spotify and then I looked at their charts just on my phone. And right there, on my screen, I saw number two, this was in the U.S.; number two, Lovin On Me by Jack Harlow; our artist number three, I Remember Everything by Zach Bryan, our artist; and number four, My Love Mine All Mine by Mitski, who's with us on Publishing. And this was -- I took a screenshot of that, and this is my favorite screen chart of this year. Three of four in Spotify in the U.S. with us, and it's just a great testament to our teams who in the beginning of the year, when I was in my first earnings call, I was sick, my voice was really bad, and we didn't have the best results, and we said we know what we're doing. We will deliver through the year, and we have, and the team has done it, and it's just amazing to be able to see the deliveries. So I just want to thank the entire company for hustling and doing that, and we commit to do that forward again. And I want to be the last one to say, again, thank you, Eric, for everything that you've done for the Company. And we may call on you here and there to take you out of your boredom, but thank you. It's been amazing to have you, and thank you for all your contribution.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Robert Kyncl",
            "content": "Thanks, Kareem, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to warmly welcome Bryan Castellani, who joined us as CFO last month. Bryan spent more than two decades at Disney, most recently as CFO of Disney Entertainment and ESPN. We're excited he's part of our team now. I'd like to say a heartfelt thank you to Eric Levin, who's been our CFO for the past nine years. Eric has brought smart steady financial leadership to WMG during a transformational period for the industry and our company. Given this quarter was his last the CFO, who will be available for Q&A. I have no doubt you'll join me in wishing him the very best as he moves into retirement in January. I'm happy to say our Q4 performance continued to deliver on the second half improvement that we promised on our Q1 earnings call. Led by an acceleration in our streaming revenue, Q4 revenue and adjusted OIBDA grew 5% and 18%, respectively. We also saw robust margin expansion of 230 basis points. For the full year, we reached a key milestone in eclipsing $6 billion of revenue for the first time ever. Our revenue and adjusted OIBDA grew 4% and 10%, respectively, and we delivered 120 basis points of margin expansion. Importantly, operating cash flow conversion was 56% of adjusted OIBDA. With industry tailwinds at our back and a solid slate of new music to start the year, we've headed into fiscal '24 with strong momentum. As always, everything we accomplished begins with our amazingly talented artists and songwriters. In recorded music, the diversity of our artist roster was showcased by a range of success stories from the global phenomenon of the Barbie soundtrack to the breakthrough countries superstar, Zach Ryan, with whom we also signed for publishing this year. Warner Records artist, Kenya Grace, scored a global hit with strangers, which rose number one on Billboard's Dance and Electronic chart. In the U.K., we celebrated the number one albums from Ed Sheeran, Bernard Boy, Lar and Liam Gallagher. And in Japan, MiSaMo made up of members of the super group Twice its number one with their first album. We continue to bolster our local success in multiple territories across the globe. We have number one hit by Gabz in Denmark, Kjartan Lauritzen in Norway. AIVA, ANA and CapoPlaza in Italy; Elva Hsiao in China; and Jasleen Royal in India just to name a few. At the same time, we brought bold inventive thinking to attracting new fans to our legendary artists and classic recordings. Recent examples included a new deluxe edition of talking had stopped making sense. The 15th anniversary of Slipknot's All Hope is Gone and the 20th anniversary of Linkin Park Meteora. With Madonna on tour, it's been a pleasure to find new ways to create cultural moments around her iconic career. These include a series of remix albums, the special pride edition of her box at containing 15 number one tracks and the celebratory viral campaign We Love Madonna. In Music Publishing, our powerful momentum continues as Warner Chappell writers contributed to 8 out of 14 Billboard number one spots in Q4, including Zach Ryan, I Remember Everything and Last Night by Morgan Wallen. We're always expanding our publishing roster and have recently signed hotly contested deals with up-and-coming stars Kaliii and Laufey and Maria Becerra. We're always reinvigorating our incredible publishing catalog, which includes evergreen copyrights from composers such as George Michael, who was just inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Gamble and Huff, Van Morrison and Stephen Sondheim. As we speak, there are three Sondheim musicals running in New York, including a revival of Sweeney Todd, starting Warner record star Josh Groben, which was just nominated for a gram. Looking forward to a new fiscal year, I'm even more optimistic than I was when I started. We're excited about the trends we're seeing in the industry and energized by our plans to capitalize on them. Let's start with the industry. Advanced repeating, music is the most popular form of entertainment and it's only getting bigger. Our addressable market encompasses virtually everyone on the planet. Growth in the music business is now well aligned with the opportunities constantly being created by the ongoing global penetration of smartphones and Internet service. Ever since I arrived at WMG, I've been laser-focused on how we can realize the true value of music. I'm grateful to all of our partners who are leaning in and figuring out how we make positive changes together. We're taking a two-pronged approach. First, price optimization, I see this as the most immediate and impactful growth lever for our industry. A more sophisticated and dynamic approach to consumer pricing will benefit the streaming platforms, music companies, artists and songwriters, the entire ecosystem, driving greater investment and innovation. In the last year, we've seen the first round of subscription price increases across every major DSP and we strongly believe there is a greater pricing opportunity in the future. Second, the evolution of royalty models, we've been consistently clear that streaming services should ascribe more value to what their customers value most. It's the creativity of popular artists and songwriters that deliver subscriber engagement and growth. To state the obvious, premium music should be better compensated than low-quality filler or functional music. We were delighted to work with Deezer to help shape their new approach to rewarding premium music. Look out for similar developments with other partners in the coming months. While these proof points represent a good start, they are just that. We will continue to work collaboratively with our partners to align behind the long-term growth of the industry. I just told you why we're excited about the music industry. Now let me explain why we're excited about Warner Music Group specifically. The future of music will be forged at the intersection of creativity and technology. With that in mind, we're carving out a distinctive proposition through the combination of the following. One, a deep iconic catalog as well as up and coming talent and thriving superstars; two, global scale with strong local capabilities and the discovery and promotion of talent; three, the ability to use technology as a force multiplier on the previous two attributes. Our commitment to each of these key areas is always underpinned by our focus on financial discipline, and we're constantly challenging ourselves to operate more efficiently and effectively. As a rule of thumb, our recorded music revenue is evenly split among three release vintages. New releases, which are less than three years old, shallow catalog, which is more than three, but less than 10 years old and deep catalog, which is more than 10 years old. We invest in A&R and marketing across each of these vintages to create a consistent flow of music from our artists and songwriters all around the world, past, present and future. We pride ourselves on discovering original talent and unique voices with long-term potential. We provide them with tailored approaches to become standout global success stories. Think one-of-a-kind genre defying artists like Bruno Mars, Ed Sheeran, Cardi B, Dua Lipa, Zach Ryan and many more. The beauty of the streaming universe is that every time one of our superstars releases a new album or goes on the tour or scores a big same placement, the fan engagement spikes across their entire body of work. Equally, in the world of playlisting and social media and a track from our catalog can go viral at any moment. These big hits from legends like Fleetwood Mac, Boney M and Madonna explode on multiple platforms, introducing these artists to a new generation. For instance, my 20-year-old daughter discovered Fleetwood Mac when their 1977 hit dreams went viral on TikTok two years ago. They are now her favorite band of all time. To fuel, maximize and monetize this uplift in engagement requires real expertise and a wide network of relationships. This is how we demonstrate our value and our relevance in the entertainment ecosystem, not just by discovering talent and promoting their latest works but by thinking holistically about their careers and growing their legacies. Our entrepreneurial culture extends to how we select which companies to invest in or acquire. A perfect example is our new venture with 10K projects, which brings us a dynamic artist roster, fresh catalog and a visionary team led by Elliott Branch. Investing in our core business is in just about the recordings and compositions that we own. It's also about leveling up our distribution business in ways that delivers profitable growth. We created more capacity for ADA to focus on developing new distribution partnerships and for our technology team to build scalable solutions to enable these partnerships. In the last year, we signed deals with a range of labels, including Australia's last ride records, the U.K.'s LAB records and the U.S. Rostrum records which launched the careers of hip-hop stars like Mac Miller and Wiz Khalifa. Let me turn now to our approach to global expansion and emerging markets. For some time now, our goal hasn't been just to market Anglo-American repertoire in local markets. Instead, we signed and develop local talent that can have regional or global success. As I've mentioned before, we're making great inroads in fast-growing territories like China, the Middle East and Africa. India is a great example of this strategy in action. With a vast population of 1.4 billion people and its huge diversity of demographics, India has an endlessly evolving music scene. According to IFDI India has more than doubled its recorded music revenue over the last five years, and it also has the highest growth of any top 20 country in 2022 at 48%. We've made huge strides since first launching our local office in Mumbai in 2020. This year alone, we've grown our presence thereby acquiring e-positive and Indian management and live events company. Launching a new JV, 91 NORTH RECORDS and expanding our partnership with Sky Digital an aggregator of Punjabi music. Our team in India is attracting massive stars, including hip hop artist King who became the first Indian performer to hit Spotify's global top 30. The music ecosystem is healthy and has a number of exciting growth drivers, with price increases happening across all major DSPs, royalty models evolving to reward quality and emerging markets gaining traction. We're very confident and positive about the path ahead. We're excited about our new releases for fiscal '24 and including some that came out just last Friday from David Guetta, Jack Harlow, PinkPantheress, and of course, Dua Lipa, who had her biggest global launch to date with her new single Houdini. There are also eagerly anticipated projects from Green Day, Kenya Grace, Cardigans, Gabby Barrett, Maria Bechara; and Myke Towers among many others. We've been working hard to build a WMG that will excel in the music industry of tomorrow. Our work is already beginning to bear fruit, and I assure you that there is much more excitement to come. And now, here's Bryan to walk you through our financial results. All right. Thanks for the question. So here's the way to think about it. We're a music company that's benefiting from the tailwinds of the music industry that we just described. The way we invest and grow is, first and foremost, into IP, and that has multiple different ways, multiple different forms. One, which is organic ANR, which we do day in day out, investing into new artists or existing audits, and there are new releases. Two, we acquire stakes in going concerns, the acquisition of 10-K is a really good example from a couple of months ago. Three, we acquired catalogs, whether it's on the publishing side, on recorded side, David Boe catalog from a couple of years ago is a good example of that. And then we look at all of these activities all around the world. I just described in the earnings call, our success in many different high-growth markets. So we're replicating all of these activities in different geographies. So it's like a four-pronged approach. Then we layer on top of that investments into technology which becomes a force multiplier on everything I just mentioned. That is the main goal. And what we do with the technology investments are 100% self-funded. That's what we committed to earlier last year, and that's what we are committing to going forward as well. And when we do this, we're creating a flywheel that is allowing us to continue our investments into growth, continue our overall growth, and continue to expand our margins at the same time. That's the strategy for our investment framework. As it relates to ADA and the free up resources, the best way to think about it is -- we have an amazing team of executives that have driven the ADA business for quite a few years. We are focusing on growing both our top line and our bottom line with a very strong global orientation, just again, in line with what I just mentioned earlier and even a minute ago. And we're focused on working with more and more labels and more and more artists all around the world and scaling that business. And technology is a really big part of that because it helps us do that more efficiently and faster and with less friction. And a great example of that is the focus of Ariel's team who runs our technology group to overhaul our supply chain and all of our partner-facing tools that, from a technology standpoint, enables this for the business team to drive acceleration in that business. So all in, the strategy to grow ADA is there as it was before because the independent space is growing, and we're leaning into that space. And two, we're just doing it differently. We're doing it in a way that is driving both top line and bottom line at the same time. Sure. Thank you. So, first, on sort of overall streaming growth, obviously, we're pleased with the industry returning to a high. I mean, to a very healthy double-digit growth. The way I think about it is that I'm not really looking at our competitors. I'm not looking at the world around us. I'm focusing on our own continual and sustained improvements. I want our company to just keep on improving on a steady basis and most importantly, on a sustained basis. It's very, very important. The -- obviously, investments into ANR and all of that, that I just mentioned a few minutes ago goes into that. But at the same time, we're investing in technology. And the best way to think about that is there's a lot of foundational work that helps us actually deliver on that sustained growth promise from a technological standpoint. I just mentioned overhauling our supply chain infrastructure. While that may sound very unsexy, the -- what benefits the business is very sexy because it's removing lots of friction and increasing speed in the way we can process more music, more partners, more artists through our supply chain. And so whether it's something that we wholly own or whether it's a partner of ADA with greatly externalized tools and improved tools, all of that contribute towards the growth of the Company while delivering on our margin expansion. So that's just one example on the technology front. Sounds good. Bryan, why don't you? Let me take the second part of the question on the beta that was announced this morning with YouTube, the AI beta. So first, I'd like to actually point out to the significance of this, which is imagine in early 2000s, if the file sharing companies came to the music industry and said, would you like to experiment with this new tool that we built and see how it impacts the industry and how we can work together. It would have been incredible. Obviously, that didn't happen. So this is the first time that a large platform at a massive scale, that has new tools at his disposal is proactively reaching out to its partners to test and learn. And I just want to underscore the significance of this kind of engagement and the sort of the orderly fashion in which this is happening. And I really applaud YouTube and DeepMind all of Google and our counterparts in the industry for participating in this because this is the right way to engage this. Whenever I say responsible engagement with our partners, this is precisely what I mean. And so we're excited about it. We're excited to learn from it. And together, we then develop a great blueprint for how things should work, but develop it based on learnings. More broadly, the way I think about our engagement on AI and what we practice is along the following lines. We have three constituents. One, which is degenerative AI engines, right? So whether it's DeepMind, Anthropic, Lambda, et cetera. And there, that's -- obviously, that's where it begins. And there, our efforts in the music industry are focused on making sure that they're licensing content for training, they're keeping records of inputs so that provenance can be tracked and then there's water marketing of the content. The second group is the platforms where most of the content, irrespective of where it will be created and by which tools will end up because people who are creating will want views or streams or lots of user engagement. And with so YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, et cetera, obviously those are the platforms Spotify. We're focused on three things, which is control, attribution and monetization. And all of those wrapped in choice for artists, artist and song writers making sure that they have a choice. And we have a blueprint from all of our work on user-generated content over the past 15 years or so, which created a multibillion-dollar industry on an annual basis for the music industry. So, we just need to now write the fine print for the AIH together with them. And then the third set of constituents is government. And over there, we are both through our trade organizations as well as ourselves working hard to make sure that regulation around AI respects the creative industries, music industry, specifically from our standpoint that licensing for training is required and also that name image likeness and voice is afforded the same protection as copyright. And I, myself, I personally have spent time over the last month with leading politicians on these issues and regulators in London, Brussels, Tokyo and a few others in D.C. and a few other cities around the world. So, lots of effort underway, but I'm really excited and positive about the YouTube beta. Sure. Thank you. So, we obviously don't talk about the details of our DSP agreements. But what I can say on the most recent one, with these, we're really excited to work with them on what was the second prong of our driving the value of music strategy, right? The first prong is price optimization and second one is new royalty models, and that's where this one is falling in. And we again, really like it when we're engaging with our partners. And again, I'm stressing that it's not just one company that you have multiple companies in the industry doing so. That's really, really important because, again, from my experience on the DSP side, if you just have one engaging with you. Yes, it's helpful but not that helpful because you need to scale things appropriately across the ecosystem and the industry, so I'm always focused on the fact that it shouldn't be just us or it shouldn't be just the other guys, it should be multiple large companies, independent as many of us working together, trying to develop better models and drive the value of music. So, we're committed to doing that on multiple fronts. And we want to make sure that the better value for music is reflected. That value is reflected better. And I forgot the second part of the question catalog acquisitions. Yes. I look at catalog as our natural resource in general. It's incredible. The catalog that Warner Music Group has is priceless. It's a gift that keeps on giving. And I use the example of my 20-year-old daughter, who two years ago, discovered Fleetwood Mac and became their biggest fan. That says everything, right? And that is what drives a big, big driver of the value of our company and then all of our efforts to keep on creating new catalogs on new releases and finding new stars that we mentioned. Zach Bryan is an amazing example of that. Obviously, there's been a lot of catalog sales over the last few years that drove up valuations. I think we're starting to see all kinds of fluctuations in that space. And we are very active, and we're watching things in all geographies, and it's a really big part of our focus to make sure that we're opportunistic and strategic at the same time about deploying our capital at the right price where we, through our predictions see a strong and growing performance of the underlying entities. Yes. So generally, we do not provide updates on timing of our deals. So, I would say speculating on those is probably not the best practice. And there's really nothing to announce. And when, we have something, we will. But there's nothing of note to speak of. Sure. So when you -- I think it's for price optimization, I think it's really important to sort of broaden the scope of thinking. And I don't mean -- I mean, it's both for our partners as well as for ourselves, the suppliers. And let me give you an example. Aside from, obviously, everything that I said before, which is catch up to inflation, get ahead of inflation, compare yourself to other industries, understand price elasticity, all of those things. So those are sort of basics. And so I'm not going to go back into that. But there are other things to look at for instance the relationship and the ratio of family plan pricing relative to individual plan pricing. Is it at the right place? So even as price increases are happening, is the ratio of these two correct? You can go further widen the aperture further by looking at China. There are no family plans in China. They are only individual accounts. Another example from China is that while you have a subscription on Tencent, certain artists or bands are selling their LPs on top of the subscription. And so, it is so useful to have a really broad aperture on all of these things and not just think myopically through how things happen and only look at the dollars within that. And I'll just give you only two examples. There are others. And there's just so many different ways to think through this. So, I think what's required for that is deep collaboration with our partners and making sure that the changes are win-win for both sides and that we drive the ecosystem up and to the right together at faster rate. Sure. I think earlier during my opening monologue, I said there's been great progress but it's just a start. And it really is just that. And I feel like we're in the first inning of it. And I'm not saying this because I'm in an earnings call with investors. Actually 100% mean this when I look at the full scope of all the work that needs to be done and the opportunity that is ahead of us. With some partners, we're much further along with others less so. But what you see is that generally, when you make progress with one, others tend to follow in different ways within 12 months. So, we are taking a prioritized approach to this. I think the agreement is that the TAM of the market is probably greater than what we have been thinking about in terms of revenue. And I think the agreement is that other industries have optimized their pricing better than we have. That doesn't mean that we've done anything wrong because we also had to get huge amounts of people into the premium experience and revenue. I think the -- what we have to figure out is how they get wins through this process in a way that it drives wins for us. And that's where there are different ways. And this goes to the aperture broadening a little bit that we have to think through different ways, not just the ways that we've been used to thinking about. And a lot of this work takes -- it takes a while. These things don't happen overnight. But it's important that it begins and then it's done in a deeply analytical fashion because that is what the DSPs will do and that it's done in a collaborative fashion because they need to bring the industry on not just one or two partners. So that's where we're focused on. I just want to close with one last thing to add, which is this weekend, I was just listening to some music on Spotify and then I looked at their charts just on my phone. And right there, on my screen, I saw number two, this was in the U.S.; number two, Lovin On Me by Jack Harlow; our artist number three, I Remember Everything by Zach Bryan, our artist; and number four, My Love Mine All Mine by Mitski, who's with us on Publishing. And this was -- I took a screenshot of that, and this is my favorite screen chart of this year. Three of four in Spotify in the U.S. with us, and it's just a great testament to our teams who in the beginning of the year, when I was in my first earnings call, I was sick, my voice was really bad, and we didn't have the best results, and we said we know what we're doing.

And I want to be the last one to say, again, thank you, Eric, for everything that you've done for the Company. And we may call on you here and there to take you out of your boredom, but thank you. It's been amazing to have you, and thank you for all your contribution."

            "name": "Bryan Castellani",
            "content": "Thank you, Robert, and good morning, everyone. I am extremely excited to be here, and I'm looking forward to engaging closely with the investment community. In my brief time at Warner Music Group, I've been impressed with the work that we are doing. We are investing in our already strong core and leveraging technology, which will continue to augment our growth through a rapidly changing music industry. We have strong momentum ahead and we'll share regular updates with you as our progress continues. Now turning to our Q4 results, as Robert highlighted, our performance in the quarter was underpinned by a solid release slate and a recovery in ad supported streaming, which drove sequential acceleration in our recorded music streaming growth. This fuels our second half improvement which combined with our disciplined cost management enabled us to deliver robust adjusted EBITDA growth and margin expansion for the full year. There are a couple of items throughout the quarter and the year that affected comparability. These include the impacts from the CRB mechanical royalty rate increase a copyright settlement and an extra reporting week. The details and adjustments relating to these items can be found in our earnings press release. I will provide growth rates in constant currency and normalized for these items. In Q4, total revenue grew 5% and adjusted OIBDA increased 18% and with a margin of 20%, an increase of 230 basis points over the prior year quarter. On a normalized basis, total revenue grew 6% and adjusted OIBDA increased 31% with a margin of 19.9%, an increase of 370 basis points over the prior year quarter. Recorded Music revenue grew 2% and 5% on a normalized basis. Despite a challenging comparison to the prior year quarter, our streaming revenue grew 9% and an improvement from the 7% we reported in Q3. Subscription streaming revenue grew by approximately 10%, representing healthy growth over the 13% we delivered in the prior year quarter and was in line with Q3. Ad-supported revenue increased by 7%. Physical revenue increased 6%, driven by strong performance in the U.S. including from new releases like the Barbie Soundtrack, 50-50, G-idle and Mac Miller. Artist services and expanded rights revenue decreased 11% and -- the decrease was due to lower merchandising revenue in the U.S. tied to timing of touring cycles and economic headwinds in Europe that continue to impact our E&P business. This was partially offset by higher concert promotion revenue. Licensing revenue grew by 7% due to higher broadcast fees. Recorded music adjusted OIBDA grew by 23%, with a margin of 21.8%, an increase of 370 basis points. On a normalized basis, adjusted OIBDA increased by 32% with margin expansion of 450 basis points. Music Publishing continues to deliver impressive results with revenue growth of 15%, driven by strength across all revenue lines. On a normalized basis, revenue grew 13%. Digital revenue increased 19% and streaming revenue increased 26%. On a normalized basis, Digital revenue grew 15% and streaming revenue increased 17%, reflecting the continued growth in streaming and the impact of digital deal renewals. Mechanical and performance revenue increased by 42% and 2%, respectively, while sync revenue increased by 3%, primarily due to stronger performance in the U.S. Music Publishing adjusted EBITDA grew 19% with a margin of 24.8%, an increase of 90 basis points. On a normalized basis, Music Publishing adjusted OIBDA grew 17% with a margin of 24.9%, an increase of 80 basis points. Moving to our full year results. Total revenue grew 4% and adjusted OIBDA grew 10% with a margin of 20.5%, an increase of 120 basis points. On a normalized basis, total revenue grew 6% and adjusted OIBDA grew 17% with a margin of 20.4%, an increase of 190 basis points. We over-delivered our margin expansion guidance even as most of the cost savings from our March restructuring were reinvested to drive our business forward. Recorded music revenue increased 2%. Within Recorded Music streaming revenue increased 4% and adjusted OIBDA grew 7%, with margin expansion of 120 basis points. On a normalized basis, recorded music revenue increased 4% and streaming revenue grew 6% with adjusted OIBDA growth of 13% and margin expansion of 180 basis points. Music Publishing revenue increased 15%, and adjusted OIBDA increased 28% with margin expansion of 270 basis points. On a normalized basis, music publishing revenue increased by 16%, and adjusted OIBDA increased by 28%, with margin expansion of 270 basis points. We continue to successfully launch certain components of our financial transformation program in select territories. The program remains on track to meaningfully roll out later this fiscal year and into FY '25. Once fully implemented, we expect the program to yield annualized run rate savings of $35 million to $40 million. Q4 CapEx of $38 million was the same as the prior year quarter. Q4 operating cash flow decreased 17% and to $338 million from $406 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by working capital items, which included higher royalty advances and the timing of digital deal renewals. Free cash flow decreased 18% to $300 million from $368 million in the prior year quarter. For the full year, operating cash flow decreased 7% to $687 million and free cash flow decreased 8% to $560 million. We delivered operating cash flow conversion with 56% for the full year, in line with our target of 50% to 60% over a multiyear period. As of September 30, we had a cash balance of $641 million, total debt of $4 billion and net debt of $3.3 billion. Our weighted average cost of debt is 4.1% and our nearest maturity date is in 2028. While growth was muted in the first half as we had some release scheduled softness, we recovered to end the year on solid footing and already have momentum in 2024. We are off to a strong start with new releases from Dua Lipa, David Guetta, Jack Harlow, PinkPantheress and many others. As we look ahead to the fiscal Q1, I want to call out a couple of items that will impact comparability. First, we announced that our digital distribution agreement with BMG will end. To frame the impact, the total revenue contribution from BMG in fiscal 2023 and was approximately 4% of total recorded music digital revenue with negligible contribution to adjusted OIBDA. BMG has already started to bring its digital distribution in-house, and it will be largely rolled off by the end of October 2024. The impact to our Q1 24 recorded music digital revenue will be approximately $15 million as both Spotify and Apple will transition this month. This impact will increase in Q2 and beyond as we will see the full quarter impact from the roll-off of these DSPs and as BMG gradually brings other digital partners in-house. We will also discontinue BMG's physical distribution by the end of October 2024. The BMG's physical distribution revenue represented less than 2% of our recorded music revenue in fiscal 2023. We will provide details going forward and disclose normalized growth adjusted for the impact of these items. Second, we have granted a licensing agreement extension for a catalog that will have a onetime favorable impact on recorded music licensing revenue and adjusted OIBDA of approximately $70 million in fiscal Q1 2024. While this is a multiyear licensing agreement extension, the revenue and adjusted OIBDA will be fully recognized in Q1. Our goal is to deliver healthy top line growth margin expansion and cash flow conversion on a consistent basis. 2024 has started with much stronger momentum than we had entering 2023 and we expect our slate throughout the year. We will invest more heavily in A&R and marketing in 2024 to ensure the success of our slate. We still expect to deliver approximately 100 basis points of margin expansion for the full year, which will be back half weighted as well as 50% to 60% of operating cash flow conversion on a multiyear basis, in line with our targets. The momentum in the music entertainment business is strong, and we continue to position ourselves for long-term success and growth. Before I close, I also want to take a moment to thank Eric. His contributions to Warner Music Group and leadership of the finance team have been measurable. I'm grateful for his and the team's support and such a smooth transition. Thank you to everyone for joining us today. We'll now open the call for questions. Ben, it's Bryan. Nice to talk to you. I just want to comment on the streaming growth and loop back to my remarks where Q4 over Q4, we had a really strong Q4 '22 and had subscription streaming growth there of 13%. And I think we were 400, 500 basis points above some of our competitors. So that comparison may be muted the quarter a little bit, and we're set up as Robert said, with the second half momentum that we continued and a stronger release slate in '24, particularly in the second half. And so, we feel good about that. And just a reminder on the price increases, that there's a lot that goes into those and those take time to roll through the industry. There's -- from announcement to implementation, geography, product mix, so there's a lot there as it works through our numbers, but we're set up well for '24. Thanks for the question. Yes. Sebastiano, thanks. On the margin expansion, as I said in my remarks, that 100 basis points a year target remains for us, and we had a strong over-delivery on an organic basis of a couple of hundred plus basis points in '23. And so that is an organic target ex-BMG for us and that will, particularly as we work through the year, it will be gradual as we work through and get the benefit, I think, of many releases in the second half. And that margin would also be excluding the catalog license sale in Q1. We continue to challenge ourselves in that regard, and we feel good about it as the team continues to be, I think, really active and vigilant cost managers and disciplined on the financial front. So we continue to keep focused on that target. Yes. And I would just add on that capital allocation that Robert mentioned. And I think he had mentioned it before as well. We were always looking to invest in A&R and new artists and licenses. There's also JVs like 10-K, we can do that through. And then, there is the purchase of catalog that is certainly a big part of our business that we continue to mine and their value continues to grow. And then that's supplemented by marketing and tech investments to for some fuel to grow those returns. But overall, we look at this through the lens of how do we drive our return on invested capital and keeping that and growing in the high teens. Yes, Ben, it's Bryan. I'll take the ad supported that we're seeing. Definite improvement there, I think everybody is familiar with the first half challenges and advertising recession. And so that rate of growth, that rate of improvement continues. And even without the addition of TikTok, in the combined revenue report there. We'd still be up. We'd still see a good improvement on the rate of change. And so, we like the trends there and are encouraged also encouraged, I think, by -- even with Spotify's remarks were. And that I think as you look across, I think, performance and streaming probably being stronger, performance and targeted advertising in the streaming space being stronger than the larger advertising space. And so, it sets it up well for '24, and we feel good about the outlook there."

At the request of Warner Music Group, today's call is being recorded for replay purposes, and if you object, you may disconnect at any time. Now I would like to turn today's call over to your host, Mr. Kareem Chin, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nKareem Chin: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Warner Music Group's fiscal third quarter earnings conference call. Please note that our earnings press release, earnings snapshot and the Form 10-Q we filed this morning will be available on our website. On today's call, we have our CEO, Robert Kyncl; and our CFO, Eric Levin, who will take you through our results and then we will answer your questions.

Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in our filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll turn it over to Robert\nRobert Kyncl: Thanks, Kareem, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining. After a challenging first two quarters, we're pleased to see strong evidence of back half recovery that we told you to expect. This has been a big team effort. I'm grateful to our leadership, all of our operators around the world and all of our incredible artists and songwriters. I was happy that our Q3 results were driven by such a wide diversity of music. Strength came from many different territories, labels and revenue lines. We succeeded with artists and songwriters across the spectrum of genres and generations. And we saw the return of some of our biggest superstars, whose new music fueled fans engagement with all of their albums. In addition to improved performance in our core recorded music revenue, we also saw growth in licensing, artist services and almost all areas of publishing. I'm particularly pleased to say we're seeing our momentum accelerate into Q4. I'll provide more details. But first, let me get into our Q3 results. Total revenue grew 10% and adjusted OIBDA increased 18% with margins growing 140 basis points year-on-year. Recorded Music revenue increased 9% and streaming grew 7%, reflecting double-digit growth in subscription revenue and modest growth in ad-supported revenue. Please note that beginning this quarter when we talk about ad-supported streaming revenue, it includes revenue from emerging streaming platforms such as TikTok, Meta, Peloton and others. Music Publishing turned in yet another impressive quarter, delivering revenue growth of 16% driven by strong streaming growth of 28%. I'd like to dive a little deeper into the different projects that drove these results as they reflect the strength of our commitment to developing extraordinary talent and growing our incredible catalog. In Recorded Music, artists at all stages of their careers, global superstars and local names, new albums and timeless classics all added to our growing momentum. Ed Sheeran's sixth studio album, Subtract, hit number 1 in 11 countries and top five in 7 other countries. Melanie Martinez's third album, Portals, went top 3 in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Ireland, New Zealand and Australia, where she celebrated her first number 1 album. Both Ed and Melanie are great examples of the same phenomenon in the modern music business. New Music combined with Perring is resulting in an uptick of streams across the entire catalog. Given the cultural relevance of life and music right now, I'm pleased to say that our Latin division is on plan. Recent successes include Puerto Rico's Myke Towers, who sought to #1 on Spotify Global Top 50 with his song Lala, and Mexico's Yng Lvcas, who's monster hit, La Bebe, spent nearly 4 months in Spotify's Global Top 10. And by the way, we just signed Yng Lvcas for publishing as well. Other amazing artists that are enjoying breakout hits include Korea's aespa, Italy's Capo Plaza, Sweden's Rogefeldt, France's Nino, the U.K. PinkPantheress, the U.S.'s Bailey's Zimmerman and Australia's Budjerah. We also partnered with Chinese superstar, Jam, for her groundbreaking album, marking the first time a Mandarin pop artist has recorded a full-length Spanish release. This partnership truly highlights how languages and genres are cross pollinating. The combination of our global reach and local expertise continues to give us a competitive advantage as we lean into this trend. Equally, it was great to see how music from our incredible catalog continued to contribute meaningfully to our results. This includes major projects with renowned names such as Linkin Park and the Grateful Dead, as well as impressive carryover sales from newer artists such as Zach Bryan, Ava Max and Don Toliver. I'm also happy to say that our Q3 momentum is carrying over into Q4. Lil Uzi Vert scored his third #1 album on the Billboard 200 with Pink Tape, the first hip hop album to top the chart in 2023. Young Thug's Business Is Business peaked at #2, and Gunna's A Gift and a Curse debuted at #3 on the Billboard 200 with his lead single reaching #1 on the Spotify in the U.S. Dua Lipa's highly anticipated new track, Dance the Night, which is currently #1 on the official European Airplay chart, kicked off the campaign for Barbie The Album released on Atlantic Records. Like the movie itself, the album has been a massive global cultural event, hitting #1 in 7 countries, including the U.K., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Netherlands, Ireland and Portugal. It is the first soundtrack ever to land 3 top 5 singles in the U.K. All in all, I'm pleased with our improvement in Q3, but we still have lots of work to do. Kudos to the whole Recorded Music team for how they partnered with our artists and worked hard to drive these results. In Publishing, we continue to see impressive results from our strategy to diversify our revenue streams, strengthen our services and mine our deep catalog. At the same time, our songwriters are contributing to massive hits, including Morgan Wallen's Last Night, Miley Cyrus' Flowers and SZA's Kill Bill, all of which reached #1 on Billboard Hot 100. And we're also seeing huge successes from Germany's Apache 207, Spain's Cavazos, the U.K.'s Dave and Mega Heart [ph] producer, Matt, to name a few. We're always expanding our publishing roster and have recently signed deals with Grammy-winning pop rockers Imagine Dragons, Ice Spice producer RiotUSA and Spanish star Ana Mena. I'd like to emphasize one other key theme today, our efforts to grow the value of music, which includes our approach to AI. We're focused on creating a virtuous cycle, where innovation, fan engagement and greater monetization thrive together, providing even bigger opportunities for artists and songwriters and music fans around the world. When I arrived at WMG, one of the first priorities I identified was the push for increases in music subscription prices. I am pleased with the traction that we're getting. Last month, Tidal, YouTube and Spotify all followed Apple, Amazon and Deezer by upping their prices. This is the fiscally responsible thing to do for themselves and for the creative community. I'd like to thank them all for taking this important step. Back in March, I said that if we adjusted for inflation since 2011, the year that music streaming was introduced in the U.S., the price of a monthly music subscription in the U.S. should be $13.25 today. I'd like to point out that in 2011, the price of a standard Netflix plan was $7.99. It has since increased to $15.49 today. If the monthly price of a music subscription had gone up by the same proportion, it would have increased from $9.99, where it was in 2011, to $19.37 today. Let's remember that music subscription services give you access to all the music ever released and a continuously growing library for roughly the price of a single CD. You need to subscribe to 3 or 4 movie and TV services for roughly $45 a month to get anywhere near a comprehensive offer. So we see these initial price increases as an encouraging start. There is no evidence that the services are experiencing elevated levels of churn. We believe the market will bear further price increases in the future, and we're expecting that they'll arrive on a more regular cadence than in the past. Again, when I joined WMG, one of the questions I repeated got was about TikTok. 7 months in, I'm pleased to say we also made great progress there. Last month, we announced an expanded and significantly improved deal with them. The agreement covers the main TikTok app; the rollout of the subscription service, TikTok Music; the video editing app, Capcut; and TikTok's commercial music library. Our deal gives our artists and songwriters access to new levels of monetization, marketing and fan development features. This is the first of its kind partnership that will also mean the joint development of additional and alternative economic models as we grow the ecosystem together. I know there is interest in the specifics of our expanded relationship, but due to confidentiality provisions, we aren't at the liberty to disclose them. What I can say is this: the deal features improved monetization per MAU that is comparable to other ad-supported DSPs, fully recognizing the value of our music and how critical it is to engagement on the platform. I was glad to have as the benefit of my experience at YouTube aligning with the music industry on solutions that worked for everyone. We look forward to working with the team at TikTok along with our other partners to continue to innovate and grow the value of music. The market's adoption of subscription price increases, combined with the ongoing evolution of our key partnerships, gives us tremendous optimism for the future of streaming growth. As we turn to AI, I'd like to point out we have a long history of working together with distribution platforms to establish licensing models that drive growth and innovation. For the past 15 years, music companies and distribution platforms have partnered to grow user-generated content as a multibillion dollar revenue stream for artists and songwriters. Today, there are obvious similarities with AI. Working with our artists and songwriters, we're leaning in, moving fast and working with a network of partners, including both generative AI engines and distribution platforms. Many Warner artists are already exploring impactful ways to use generative AI to create, augment and remix their music. We have some great examples from big names on the way later this quarter. Other artists are using generative AI for visuals with the artist like metal band Disturbed and dance producer [indiscernible] and the superstar Rob of Linkin Park all creating highly impactful music videos. In addition, AI-enabled stem separation technology is giving new life to recordings by artists who are no longer with us. For example, AI has been used to isolate the vocal performance from sound recordings of legendary entertainment Sammy Davis Jr. and renowned opera singer Maria Callas as part of groundbreaking singles. We're deeply inspired by our artists\u2019 abilities to embrace and push the boundaries of the latest technology. I'd like to highlight one of the first official and professionally AI-generated song featuring a deceased artist, which came through our ADA Latin division. Costa Rican musician Pedro Capmany has released a new duet with his dad, the legendary father of Costa Rican Rock, Jose Capmany. This is Jose's first song since 2001, the year of his tragic death. After analyzing hundreds of hours of interviews, a cappellas recorded songs and live performances from Jose's career, every nuance and the pattern of his voice was modeled using AI and machine learning. The resulting song movingly announces the arrival of Pedro's son, Jose's grandson. It also coincides with Jose's catalog being available on all streaming services for the first time. With the right framework in place, AI will enable fans to pay their heroes the ultimate compliment through a new level of user-driven content, including new cover versions and mash-ups. AI is unquestionably one of the most transformative forces in human history. Nonetheless, this technology shift is more familiar terrain than first meets the eye. Like many technologies before it, it presents massive opportunities for human creativity and innovation. Q4 is off to a strong start with amazing releases, including Barbie The Album, Burna Boy, Nino, PinkPantheress, Tiago PZK, Cali, Tiesto and Anne-Marie. And we have new music coming from Zach Bryan, Sia, Dan and Shay, David Guetta, Charlie Puth, Omar Apollo and Robin Schulz. We have a fantastic roster of artists and songwriters and a great team. We continue to invest in our expertise and infrastructure, both creative and technological, in order to create long-term success. As I said in my first earnings call, I'm a big believer in action speaking louder than words. So today, more than anything else I've said, it's our results that show we're gaining real traction. And there is a lot to be excited about in Q4 and beyond. Eric, over to you.\nEric Levin: Thank you, Robert, and good morning, everyone. Our Q3 results are reflective of a robust release slate, strong carryover from a variety of artists across different genres and geographies, easing ad comps and outstanding performance in our publishing business. As a result, we delivered solid growth across key metrics, including revenue, adjusted OIBDA and adjusted OIBDA margin. Total revenue increased 10%, reflecting growth in both Recorded Music and Music Publishing. Adjusted OIBDA increased 18% with a margin of 19% compared to 17.6% in the prior year quarter. These increases were primarily due to strong operating performance and disciplined cost management. Our margin performance in the quarter was not materially impacted by savings from our March headcount reduction as we reinvested most of the savings into technology. Although, we anticipate that we will similarly reinvest most of those savings for the balance of this fiscal year, we are raising our guidance to deliver full year margin expansion at the high end of our 50 to 100 basis point range. Recorded Music revenue grew 9%. Streaming revenue increased 7%. Subscription streaming revenue grew in the low double-digits and ad-supported increased in the low single-digits. As Robert mentioned earlier, starting Q3 and going forward, when we talk about ad-supported streaming revenue, it will be inclusive of revenue from emerging streaming platforms. Our streaming results improved in each month of the quarter as we released new music. Additionally, the market-related ad-supported headwind moderated as we lapped the pressure we began to see in the prior year quarter. Physical revenue increased 2%, driven by solid performance in the U.S. Artist services and expanded rights revenue increased by 14% due to higher content promotion and merchandising revenue. Licensing revenue increased 24% driven by growth in sync and broadcast fees. Recorded Music adjusted OIBDA increased by 16% with a margin of 20.6%. This is an increase of 130 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. Music Publishing continues to deliver strong results, posting 16% revenue growth, driven by strength in digital and mechanical. Digital revenue grew 27% and streaming revenue increased 28%, reflecting the continued growth in streaming, digital deal renewals and a revenue true-up of $9 million. We had a $17 million benefit from the CRB rate increase in the prior year quarter, and we had a $7 million benefit in the current quarter. Performance revenue decreased by 9% due to the timing of payments from collection societies. Mechanical revenue increased by 45%, primarily due to a higher share of physical sales and timing of distributions. Sync was flat due to lower commercial licensing activity, offset by copyright infringement settlements. Music Publishing adjusted OIBDA increased 32% to $74 million with margin increasing 310 basis points to 26.1%, driven by strong operating performance. In April, we successfully launched certain components of our financial transformation program in select territories. The program remains on track to meaningfully roll out in a wave-based approach and with expanded functionalities during fiscal 2023, 2024 and into 2025. Once fully implemented, we expect the program to yield annualized run rate savings of $35 million to $40 million. Q3 CapEx decreased to $33 million as compared to $35 million in the prior year quarter. Operating cash flow decreased 10% to $146 million from $163 million in the prior year quarter due to higher cash taxes and cash interest. Free cash flow decreased 12% to $113 million from $128 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted OIBDA to operating cash flow conversion was 49% in Q3. Our goal remains to deliver an operating cash conversion of 50% to 60% over a multiyear period, and we expect to achieve this target for 2023. As of June 30, we had a cash balance of $600 million, total debt of approximately $4 billion and net debt of $3.4 billion. Our weighted average cost of debt is 4.1% and our nearest maturity date is in 2028. As we look ahead, we expect continued improvement in our results. We are working hard to execute against our plan and look forward to sharing more about fiscal 2024 on our next earnings call. Thank you to everyone for joining us today. We'll now open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Benjamin Swinburne with Morgan Stanley.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Robert, you mentioned the price increases. I think you thanked the DSPs for what you described as a good start. But at least from our perspective, there's a bigger prize longer term, which is really continued movement of prices higher and really maybe a structural change to sort of the incentives that are driving the market. So I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about your confidence in your ability or the industry's ability to really drive significant change in the incentive structure and whether or not you have a new agreement with Spotify, because there was some disclosure in their quarterly filings suggesting they've got a number of new commitments with partners. Universal announced a new agreement. So I would love to hear your thoughts on sort of the long-term changes you'd like to see the industry adopt beyond just 1 year of price increases? And also whether you can talk a little bit about your relationship with Spotify, whether anything has changed there?\nRobert Kyncl: Let me take it from the backwards. So no, we do not have a new deal with Spotify. So let me just clarify that upfront. We're not in relationship with the consumers. Our DSP partners are. So they are free to raise prices at any time without any contractual change. So it's not required in order to do so. I think as I look forward into the future -- obviously, you've heard me in my opening remarks talk about the value of music. And this being a first step in what I believe is a more regular cadence of increases. But let me give an example of what I think should happen more often and why. If you look at the history of Netflix and their innovation around price, it was really both on the way down and on the way up. Netflix started at $20 a month more than 20 years ago, then it went up to $22, and then it, over the course of many years, has innovated down to $19, $18, $17, $16, all the way down to $7.99. And then it started to grow it back up. And today, the standard plan is $15. I forget the name of the next plan. I hope with more family members on it, is $19, so close to $20. The level of innovation around price is incredible. And I think that the DSPs in the music space will begin on the same path, because the video services are showing us a price elasticity that consumer has that it is not resulting in elevated levels of churn. Now let me be clear. I am not suggesting that we go to $19 today. That is not what I'm saying. But what I'm pointing out is the innovation that is happening in the entertainment space, around it, the value that we all provide to users and the elasticity that is there. And we are -- we obviously want to make sure that we're working collaboratively together with our DSP partners to innovate over the next decade around this point.\nBenjamin Swinburne: And then if I could ask you a follow-up, you and/or Eric, just around margins. I mean this quarter, we really saw the business deliver the kind of growth I think we all kind of expect over time, particularly both revenue, but also operating leverage. I think there's still some question out there, Robert, about whether your appetite to sort of reinvent the organization from a technology point of view is going to cause some kind of pause in the margin story that we're seeing again this quarter. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the technology investments you're making and whether you think you can continue to drive operating leverage in the business over time, assuming the top line performs?\nEric Levin: Ben, this is Eric. I'll take that. So I think the first thing to note is that we did a restructuring, reduced headcount this year, are getting meaningful savings from that. Our technology investments are really being funded by those savings, not coming out of margin. So that's the first point. The second point is at the IPO, we had a long-term projection of 100 basis points increase per year on average in margin. We have largely met that. We're saying we're going to meet that again in '23. I will say that as we look forward, we are focused on margin increases. We are working on our '24 budget now, so I don't have anything specific to say for '24. I will say that we actively -- Robert, myself, the business team actively worked on a game plan for OIBDA growth and margin improvement within fiscal '23. We're working collectively as a team. Early in the year, I said 50 to 100 basis points was realistic for this year. Now, we're confirming the high end of that range as our objective, as our goal for the year. And that is largely through active management of the business. Both revenue growth -- we saw reaccelerated digital growth in Recorded this year and extraordinary performance in our Publishing division, both with growing margins and active cost management, not just in headcount, but also areas like marketing that allow us to achieve this strong margin growth. So we as a team will continue to look at growth in the business, both top line and margin. Where exactly it will land in '24, we'll report in future quarters as we finalize our budget. But it's very much in the center of our focus.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Morris with Guggenheim Securities.\nMichael Morris: I wanted to ask about the TikTok agreement. There's a lot of complexity in the announcement here. So I'm hoping you can share some additional detail. As you look at the different components of this agreement, Robert, can you help us understand which elements are the most impactful to your business maybe in the near term as compared to which elements need to unfold a bit more over time? So some details there would be great. I'm also curious as to whether this deal sets any precedent for other technology partnerships that you have? And then finally, Eric, you've discussed in the past to move on some of these kind of emerging agreements from fixed payment structures into more variable agreements. So does this agreement start to compensate you more on a usage basis, particularly given just the popularity of the platform?\nEric Levin: Sure. Go ahead you start. Go ahead start, Robert.\nRobert Kyncl: All right. Eric and I are shuffling with this thing. I won. So obviously, we can't share much, confidentiality, as I mentioned before. What I can tell you on the elements, obviously, I focused on value for us. And what is important to me is that whether it's in ad-supported or subscription, that we have fairness across all of our distributors so that nobody feels disadvantaged or advantaged in any way. And that we have a well-distributed distributor set of partners with all sort of feeling equal. And so that was an important tenant of the relationship with me -- with TikTok. But what I also wanted to make sure is that we focus on the users, on their users, because that is important to TikTok and any DSP for that matter. And I think it's important for music companies to focus on that equally in order to make it win-win. And I have to say that I'm very pleased with the way Shou, the TikTok CEO, has engaged and sought also a win-win deal for both sides. And I want to make sure that this impactful platform drives even more value for us in the future, because we're delivering the value to them as well. And I think we've achieved this between both parties. And -- but there's a lot of work to do for us to unleash even more opportunities, and we have a road map for that.\nEric Levin: Yes. Let me add a few things. One is -- and again, consistent with what Robert said and how our philosophy is, having services that compete with each other that our monetization is in line so that we're not incented to support one service versus another, but to provide the best content we can across all services and let their competition in the market determine where audiences go. So we're achieving our objective as we do these deals. TikTok is an example of that. It also opens up new growth drivers as they roll out subscription services and then other products that they want to. What I will say is we have been saying for quite some time that we've had emerging streaming deals that were concluded in 2021 that we expected renewals in '23 and '24. This obviously is a substantive one of them. What we will say is that this is happening pretty much when we expected and in line with where we would have expected this to. So this is really consistent with our model and our forecast. And we're really pleased this deal concluded, and Robert said in good partnerships. So we move forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Batya Levi with UBS.\nBatya Levi: Great. Can you provide a little bit more color on the emerging platform revenue mix now and your expectations for growth over the next couple of quarters? And maybe just one question on the advertising trends. Did you start to see some improvement in the base, excluding the emerging platform? And how should we think about that going forward?\nEric Levin: So a few -- so the first thing is, this is the first quarter -- and hopefully, this simplifies things for folks out there. We know that it's been something we've had to explain in components in the past. We're now combining the emerging streaming category and the traditional ad-supported streaming category combined, which is how we know others report this as well. We have seen improvement in the -- in that category sequentially as the market improves, specifically for ad-supported services. You see that in the reporting -- of public reporting of some of the services that we have licenses with. So we're seeing this as a continued category of improvement quarter-to-quarter. We see the emerging subset, more the social gaming subset that's continuing to show upside and opportunity and growth. And the traditional ad side, which was declining for the past year or so, really starting to come back into a positive growth environment. So across the board, we've been pleased. And again, as we've said, as I said before, we had a series of renewals that are coming up in '23 and '24. TikTok being one that we talked about publicly that was just done, noting that, that didn't affect our Q3 results, but that deal was done in our fiscal Q4 and we'll see that in our fiscal Q4.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kutgun Maral with Evercore ISI.\nKutgun Maral: I was hoping to follow up on the streaming revenue discussion. When I think of the DSP price increases, TikTok deal and improved ad-supported trends, at this moment, there seems to be more tailwinds to growth then maybe there has been at any other point over the last few years. I know you called out that momentum has carried into Q4. But is there any more color you can provide on if we should see another acceleration in the year-over-year growth and how high that could get to? And specifically, I realize you don't provide guidance, but are we entering a period for the next year or so when Recorded Music subscription streaming revenue growth could get closer to a low teens range compared to the double-digits in Q3?\nEric Levin: This is Eric. I'm happy to take the question. So I think you are right. When you look at -- traditionally, when you look at -- I mean at the time of our IPO, just looking back a couple of years, when you looked at what's going to drive streaming growth, it was the numerical growth in subscribers, it was literally subscription growth. Now, it's a multipronged growth engine. It continues to be subscriptions, but now it's not just developed markets. Emerging markets have accelerated their growth in subscriptions pricing. We've seen in the past year pricing come pretty much across the board now for all -- virtually all substantive distributors. You're seeing emerging streaming continue to grow with positive renewals, reaffirming the category and it's potential You're seeing the traditional ad-supported streaming that was affected by economic weakness starting to improve and get back to positive growth. So we're seeing a series of growth drivers in streaming, all of which are seeing positive momentum. As far as the number that, that growth will hit in the short-term, I wouldn't want to give that forecast there. Many third-parties that publish numbers there, I would ask you to look at, study and evaluate their assumptions. But I would say that as we were -- as we're entering fiscal '20 -- almost entering fiscal '24 versus '23, the environment across the board has become meaningfully more positive and optimistic as far as the variety of growth drivers and the strength of the growth drivers. So we do agree with you that there's real positive momentum out there, Kutgun.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Benjamin Black with Deutsche Bank.\nBenjamin Black: So Robert, on the last earnings call, you mentioned the, disconnect between sort of the value of stream from higher caliber artists and sort of the current payment model. Obviously, quite a few DSPs have raised pricing. So I guess my question here is, have you made any progress towards a more artist-centric model? And then just a quick follow-up question on TikTok -- I think when it was announced you mentioned the possibility of new revenue opportunities for your artists and your song writers and also new fandom monetization on possibilities. So what exactly are those new opportunities? Any additional color or commentary would be great there?\nRobert Kyncl: So on the progress around DSPs. So the -- if you sort of step back, what I highlighted before is there is sort of disparity between the value that users receive by subscribing to music services and what it costs today, right? I've like I said in multiple times versus Netflix versus inflation, et cetera that's monthly. And the need for innovating around price optimization. And what has served the industry incredibly well for the past 15 years, was this collaboration about getting hundreds of millions of people -- multiple hundreds of millions of people into the premium experience, creating playlists and having stickiness and I'm in a great value prop. I don't think that is what will serve the industry well in the next 15 years. And we will all collectively have to focus on much more innovation around audience segmentation and price optimization and without negatively impacting any of the users, I should add. And that is not a thing that happens overnight or quarter-to-quarter. It's a carefully developed and orchestrated change that we will undergo, but don't expect news on that anytime soon. It takes time to unfold. And it takes multiple parties. It takes 2 to tango in this and more than 2 in this case. And -- but I'm very much focused on it, because I do think it is the right thing for all parties involved. And it's worth undergoing and do it in the most collaborative fashion possible. I forgot there was a second part of your question, which I'll pick up. Now TikTok, I think I said earlier that I can't give too many details on TikTok because of our confidentiality agreements. So, I get a lot of questions on it every time, you have massive user engagement, which TikTok has, right? It's been very successful in creating it. It creates new opportunities, not just for that company that has the consumer, but also for companies that work with it to develop new revenue streams off of this fan engagement. And whether that fan engagement is promotional in nature or economic and e-commerce driven, all of those are the possibilities. And what I wanted to establish is having a strong agreement with TikTok that gives us the license to both go deep together and innovate in the coming years. And that's what we're doing. So we're -- I can't really share any more details on that. But other than I'm very pleased to be partnered with them to partner with Shou and his team and off and running.\nOperator: Our one from the line of Douglas Creutz with Cowen & Company.\nDouglas Creutz: You talked a bit about some of the opportunities you've had using AI to create music. And I just wondered if you could talk a little bit about both sort of on the legal side, the rights issues that you have to negotiate with doing that. And then also just in terms of the relationships with the artists, obviously, AI has become a point of some significant tension in other entertainment fields and kind of where your discussions sit right now with respect to that?\nRobert Kyncl: Yes. So as you can imagine, we are deeply engaged with our distribution partners as well as with the generative AI engines. So it's like sort of 2 fronts that we're having lots of discussion and collaboration around. I always view this as both defensive and offensive. And that is one of the reasons I mentioned in my opening remarks, some of the great progress we're making around generative AI with some of our artists. And there's a lot more that is happening behind the scenes that I have not talked about. And because it's a creative tool. However, the thing that is important is that artists have a choice, because there are some that may not like it, and that's totally fine. And then there are some that will embrace it, and that's also fine. And we have to make sure that we ensure that they have a choice and that something is not done to them that is done with them. And so, that is my utmost priority here, because there's nothing more precious to an artist than their voice and protecting their voice is protecting their livelihood and protecting their persona. So, I want to make sure that we deliver on that. And at the same time, we deliver on opportunities that the tools can provide them.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sebastiano Petti with JPMorgan.\nSebastiano Petti: Eric, just trying on this one here. You said you wouldn't give us any color on '24 in terms of margins, but can you help us unpack maybe the phasing in of the financial transformation program? What if -- could you perhaps highlight what percentage or what you saw in the quarter? Was it material? Maybe how that will phase in through '25? And as you're looking into '24, anything that we should keep in mind in terms of comps this year relative to '22, which will perhaps normalize inside of 2024, thinking about the reported margin expansion, what that kind of looks like more on a like-for-like basis and '23 seems to be better -- better than perhaps -- coming in on a reported basis. And then I guess another kind of cleanup question here while just on the emerging streaming platform, great that it's going to be combined with ad-supported going forward to align with peers. But could you give us an update on the underlying emerging streaming platform revenue perhaps in the quarter and trying to parse that out against the true underlying ad-supported growth, I think you called out?\nEric Levin: Okay. A lot of questions packed in there, Sebastiano. Nice to hear from you. All right. Let me try to tackle that. I think I've got 3 groups of questions. So one is financial transformation -- what we're trying to communicate there is a few things. 1 is that it's launched. It is live. We have several markets now using the new technology successfully, and that is fantastic. It is working and functional in a few markets. What we have done is adjusted our launch schedule to come in waves across fiscal '23, '24 and into fiscal '25. This will allow us to make sure that we have the proper support and hyper-care as each segment of markets is rolled out to make sure that it is successful. And that as we do this, we have the ability to use the new processes and tools successfully with the right training, the right controls. So it's a very thorough launch plan phasing over time. As we roll out, the benefits will roll in with it. Obviously, a substantial portion of the benefits happen when it is global. So some of the benefits will roll in, in '24, although a very modest amount, larger in '25. And once it's rolled out in '25, the benefits we expect to be robust for fiscal '26. You asked the questions about margin, I'm not sure 100% got it. What I will say about fiscal '23 is that the acceleration of digital and streaming revenue in the second half of '23, which is high-margin revenue is a great boost and our active cost management is allowing us to meet the high end of the range, which is what we've been looking at in prior years, not every year is exactly the same. I don't have an analytical like-for-like comparison sitting in front of me. But every year, we are looking for the opportunities to achieve the high end of the range, depending on the mix of releases distributed versus owned artist services and its rate of growth, which is lower revenue every year has a slightly different profile. But as we look at and we'll look at in the '24 budget, look at the profile of '24s revenue and the margins of that revenue and build the best plan for the year, we can with margin growth as one of the things we are actively managing. Your last question was now that we're reporting emerging streaming and ad-supported together, I think you want us to give some color on each piece. What we'll say is that in emerging streaming, there were no notable new deals in '23, the TikTok deal -- I'm sorry, in Q3 of '23. The TikTok deal commences in Q4. The category in emerging streaming continue to grow nicely, I would say, well into the teens and as supported continued to show sequential improvement heading back towards growth. And so hopefully, that gives you the color that you want Sebastiano.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Thornton with Truist Securities.\nMatthew Thornton: Most of mine have been answered. So a couple of housekeeping questions, if I could. I think given the cadence of the recent price increases across the DSPs, I would assume that we probably don't see the full run rate impact of that until the calendar fourth quarter, so fiscal first quarter. I just want to make sure that, that's a fair assumption. And then maybe for Eric, in the publishing side of things and streaming, I think there's a couple of puts and takes between renewals and a revenue true-up and some CRB impact. And I think there was a copyright infringement settlement within Sync. I'm just kind of curious how to net those out in terms of what the -- maybe the net impact from some of those one-time items might have been in the quarter. Any color there would be helpful?\nEric Levin: Thanks, Matthew. So I'll take the second one first, because they pretty much net out to 0. The 2 most substantive things in Publishing was the revenue true-up in streaming and the CRB on a records 3, which has now been finalized at the kind of backlog revenue impact now that it's able to be calculated. The revenue true-up was a positive. The CRB, although there was a positive this quarter. The prior year was a positive -- it was $10 million more. So when you net that all out, it all nets to 0, the streaming revenue growth of 28% in publishing is about what it is once you net out all those true-ups. So it's really kind of negate each other. On the price increases on the recorded side, I would really say to expect the benefit of those or the full benefit of those in fiscal '24. And Spotify's announced rate increase as an example, it takes a few months to execute, rollout to their consumers and then roll that into our numbers. So, I'd expect to see the price increases roll through our numbers in fiscal '24, not I don't think realistically in Q4 '23.\nMatthew Thornton: And maybe I could sneak one more on housekeeping as well, Eric. The lower variable marketing spend that you talked a little bit about in the release. I just wanted to kind of double check if that's something that's sustainable or if that's something that needs to come back a little bit. Any color there as well?\nEric Levin: I'd say it's too early for us or me to make a definitive statement there. I think some of that depends on the release schedule, which markets it skewed towards some markets have higher need to break local music and a higher marketing demand when some products come out in -- with partners or partnerships of how they're released it creates efficiencies in marketing. So it depends on the release schedule for next year. Obviously, as you see from this year, we're very actively looking at evaluating and managing costs, including marketing. And as we look forward, we will continue to -- with great discipline, evaluate and manage those. But I wouldn't want to yet call a specific permanent lower variable marketing. I will say that we're very actively looking to manage and improve margins, and that is one of the significant tools that you have to use.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nStephen Laszczyk: I was wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit more about the momentum you saw in market share in the third quarter on the back of some strong releases, especially if there's anything you can say around perhaps the cadence or magnitude of those trends? And then maybe looking ahead, could you maybe give us an update on how the release slate stacks up in the back half of this year versus what we saw in the first half?\nRobert Kyncl: Sure. So first, I want to point out that we had -- we obviously had a great release slate with lots of momentum and lots of success. But at the same time, our catalog has also delivered, which is something that I tremendously appreciate. So it was -- we're kind of been firing on both engines, new release and catalog. We have a great slate for the next quarter. There's -- I would say the best way to think about this is that we entered the quarter with great success with Lil Uzi Vert, Gunna, Young Thug, Kelly Clarkson, aespa, and the Barbie Soundtrack, obviously, is a huge blockbuster. So our entry into the quarter has been great and our slate looks also very, very strong for Q4 and the rest of the year. There's lots of great new releases coming up from Burna Boy, Nino, PinkPantheress, Tiago PZK, Cali, Tiesto, Anne-Marie and so on and on and on. So -- and we have some new music coming from Zach Bryan and Dan and Shay, Sia, David Guetta, Charlie Puth, Robin Schulz, et cetera. So there's a lot of activity. The team is firing on all cylinders. And I'm just glad that we have reaccelerated and that we continue.\nStephen Laszczyk: Great. And maybe just a longer-term question on the publishing business. You're seeing some great momentum on that side of the house. I was wondering if you can maybe talk a little bit more about the diversification and services strategy that you're pushing through in that business? And to what degree we maybe could expect similar outperformance on the publishing side over the course of '24?\nRobert Kyncl: Yes. I mean it's hard for me to guide for '24, just to sort of be in line with Eric on that. But what I can say is that Guy and Carianne have done a tremendous job over the past 4 years with Warner Chappell and run a very efficient and effective machine. They've diversified our services. They mine the catalog incredibly well. And we have 1 million -- more than 1 million songs that we're focusing on monetizing. And that takes some machine to do. And they're incredible operators and their results are really speaking for themselves. So obviously, I work with them very closely to set this up for the future and make sure that we continue, but I'm not prepared to guide on that into '24 as of today. But overall, I just want to close by saying I'm very grateful to the whole company to our teams, Hassel in the last quarter and in the current quarter, and it's great to see music speaking for itself and delivering the results. Thank you.\nOperator: I'd like to hand the call back over to Robert Kyncl for closing remarks.\nRobert Kyncl: So I want to thank you all for taking the time out of your day to dial in to our call for all of your thoughtful questions for challenging us on things. And again, I'm very appreciative to the entire team at Warner Music Group, and I look forward to our next earnings call with you. Have a great morning.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Robert Kyncl",
            "content": "Thanks, Kareem, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining. After a challenging first two quarters, we're pleased to see strong evidence of back half recovery that we told you to expect. This has been a big team effort. I'm grateful to our leadership, all of our operators around the world and all of our incredible artists and songwriters. I was happy that our Q3 results were driven by such a wide diversity of music. Strength came from many different territories, labels and revenue lines. We succeeded with artists and songwriters across the spectrum of genres and generations. And we saw the return of some of our biggest superstars, whose new music fueled fans engagement with all of their albums. In addition to improved performance in our core recorded music revenue, we also saw growth in licensing, artist services and almost all areas of publishing. I'm particularly pleased to say we're seeing our momentum accelerate into Q4. I'll provide more details. But first, let me get into our Q3 results. Total revenue grew 10% and adjusted OIBDA increased 18% with margins growing 140 basis points year-on-year. Recorded Music revenue increased 9% and streaming grew 7%, reflecting double-digit growth in subscription revenue and modest growth in ad-supported revenue. Please note that beginning this quarter when we talk about ad-supported streaming revenue, it includes revenue from emerging streaming platforms such as TikTok, Meta, Peloton and others. Music Publishing turned in yet another impressive quarter, delivering revenue growth of 16% driven by strong streaming growth of 28%. I'd like to dive a little deeper into the different projects that drove these results as they reflect the strength of our commitment to developing extraordinary talent and growing our incredible catalog. In Recorded Music, artists at all stages of their careers, global superstars and local names, new albums and timeless classics all added to our growing momentum. Ed Sheeran's sixth studio album, Subtract, hit number 1 in 11 countries and top five in 7 other countries. Melanie Martinez's third album, Portals, went top 3 in the U.S., U.K., Canada, Ireland, New Zealand and Australia, where she celebrated her first number 1 album. Both Ed and Melanie are great examples of the same phenomenon in the modern music business. New Music combined with Perring is resulting in an uptick of streams across the entire catalog. Given the cultural relevance of life and music right now, I'm pleased to say that our Latin division is on plan. Recent successes include Puerto Rico's Myke Towers, who sought to #1 on Spotify Global Top 50 with his song Lala, and Mexico's Yng Lvcas, who's monster hit, La Bebe, spent nearly 4 months in Spotify's Global Top 10. And by the way, we just signed Yng Lvcas for publishing as well. Other amazing artists that are enjoying breakout hits include Korea's aespa, Italy's Capo Plaza, Sweden's Rogefeldt, France's Nino, the U.K. PinkPantheress, the U.S.'s Bailey's Zimmerman and Australia's Budjerah. We also partnered with Chinese superstar, Jam, for her groundbreaking album, marking the first time a Mandarin pop artist has recorded a full-length Spanish release. This partnership truly highlights how languages and genres are cross pollinating. The combination of our global reach and local expertise continues to give us a competitive advantage as we lean into this trend. Equally, it was great to see how music from our incredible catalog continued to contribute meaningfully to our results. This includes major projects with renowned names such as Linkin Park and the Grateful Dead, as well as impressive carryover sales from newer artists such as Zach Bryan, Ava Max and Don Toliver. I'm also happy to say that our Q3 momentum is carrying over into Q4. Lil Uzi Vert scored his third #1 album on the Billboard 200 with Pink Tape, the first hip hop album to top the chart in 2023. Young Thug's Business Is Business peaked at #2, and Gunna's A Gift and a Curse debuted at #3 on the Billboard 200 with his lead single reaching #1 on the Spotify in the U.S. Dua Lipa's highly anticipated new track, Dance the Night, which is currently #1 on the official European Airplay chart, kicked off the campaign for Barbie The Album released on Atlantic Records. Like the movie itself, the album has been a massive global cultural event, hitting #1 in 7 countries, including the U.K., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Netherlands, Ireland and Portugal. It is the first soundtrack ever to land 3 top 5 singles in the U.K. All in all, I'm pleased with our improvement in Q3, but we still have lots of work to do. Kudos to the whole Recorded Music team for how they partnered with our artists and worked hard to drive these results. In Publishing, we continue to see impressive results from our strategy to diversify our revenue streams, strengthen our services and mine our deep catalog. At the same time, our songwriters are contributing to massive hits, including Morgan Wallen's Last Night, Miley Cyrus' Flowers and SZA's Kill Bill, all of which reached #1 on Billboard Hot 100. And we're also seeing huge successes from Germany's Apache 207, Spain's Cavazos, the U.K.'s Dave and Mega Heart [ph] producer, Matt, to name a few. We're always expanding our publishing roster and have recently signed deals with Grammy-winning pop rockers Imagine Dragons, Ice Spice producer RiotUSA and Spanish star Ana Mena. I'd like to emphasize one other key theme today, our efforts to grow the value of music, which includes our approach to AI. We're focused on creating a virtuous cycle, where innovation, fan engagement and greater monetization thrive together, providing even bigger opportunities for artists and songwriters and music fans around the world. When I arrived at WMG, one of the first priorities I identified was the push for increases in music subscription prices. I am pleased with the traction that we're getting. Last month, Tidal, YouTube and Spotify all followed Apple, Amazon and Deezer by upping their prices. This is the fiscally responsible thing to do for themselves and for the creative community. I'd like to thank them all for taking this important step. Back in March, I said that if we adjusted for inflation since 2011, the year that music streaming was introduced in the U.S., the price of a monthly music subscription in the U.S. should be $13.25 today. I'd like to point out that in 2011, the price of a standard Netflix plan was $7.99. It has since increased to $15.49 today. If the monthly price of a music subscription had gone up by the same proportion, it would have increased from $9.99, where it was in 2011, to $19.37 today. Let's remember that music subscription services give you access to all the music ever released and a continuously growing library for roughly the price of a single CD. You need to subscribe to 3 or 4 movie and TV services for roughly $45 a month to get anywhere near a comprehensive offer. So we see these initial price increases as an encouraging start. There is no evidence that the services are experiencing elevated levels of churn. We believe the market will bear further price increases in the future, and we're expecting that they'll arrive on a more regular cadence than in the past. Again, when I joined WMG, one of the questions I repeated got was about TikTok. 7 months in, I'm pleased to say we also made great progress there. Last month, we announced an expanded and significantly improved deal with them. The agreement covers the main TikTok app; the rollout of the subscription service, TikTok Music; the video editing app, Capcut; and TikTok's commercial music library. Our deal gives our artists and songwriters access to new levels of monetization, marketing and fan development features. This is the first of its kind partnership that will also mean the joint development of additional and alternative economic models as we grow the ecosystem together. I know there is interest in the specifics of our expanded relationship, but due to confidentiality provisions, we aren't at the liberty to disclose them. What I can say is this: the deal features improved monetization per MAU that is comparable to other ad-supported DSPs, fully recognizing the value of our music and how critical it is to engagement on the platform. I was glad to have as the benefit of my experience at YouTube aligning with the music industry on solutions that worked for everyone. We look forward to working with the team at TikTok along with our other partners to continue to innovate and grow the value of music. The market's adoption of subscription price increases, combined with the ongoing evolution of our key partnerships, gives us tremendous optimism for the future of streaming growth. As we turn to AI, I'd like to point out we have a long history of working together with distribution platforms to establish licensing models that drive growth and innovation. For the past 15 years, music companies and distribution platforms have partnered to grow user-generated content as a multibillion dollar revenue stream for artists and songwriters. Today, there are obvious similarities with AI. Working with our artists and songwriters, we're leaning in, moving fast and working with a network of partners, including both generative AI engines and distribution platforms. Many Warner artists are already exploring impactful ways to use generative AI to create, augment and remix their music. We have some great examples from big names on the way later this quarter. Other artists are using generative AI for visuals with the artist like metal band Disturbed and dance producer [indiscernible] and the superstar Rob of Linkin Park all creating highly impactful music videos. In addition, AI-enabled stem separation technology is giving new life to recordings by artists who are no longer with us. For example, AI has been used to isolate the vocal performance from sound recordings of legendary entertainment Sammy Davis Jr. and renowned opera singer Maria Callas as part of groundbreaking singles. We're deeply inspired by our artists' abilities to embrace and push the boundaries of the latest technology. I'd like to highlight one of the first official and professionally AI-generated song featuring a deceased artist, which came through our ADA Latin division. Costa Rican musician Pedro Capmany has released a new duet with his dad, the legendary father of Costa Rican Rock, Jose Capmany. This is Jose's first song since 2001, the year of his tragic death. After analyzing hundreds of hours of interviews, a cappellas recorded songs and live performances from Jose's career, every nuance and the pattern of his voice was modeled using AI and machine learning. The resulting song movingly announces the arrival of Pedro's son, Jose's grandson. It also coincides with Jose's catalog being available on all streaming services for the first time. With the right framework in place, AI will enable fans to pay their heroes the ultimate compliment through a new level of user-driven content, including new cover versions and mash-ups. AI is unquestionably one of the most transformative forces in human history. Nonetheless, this technology shift is more familiar terrain than first meets the eye. Like many technologies before it, it presents massive opportunities for human creativity and innovation. Q4 is off to a strong start with amazing releases, including Barbie The Album, Burna Boy, Nino, PinkPantheress, Tiago PZK, Cali, Tiesto and Anne-Marie. And we have new music coming from Zach Bryan, Sia, Dan and Shay, David Guetta, Charlie Puth, Omar Apollo and Robin Schulz. We have a fantastic roster of artists and songwriters and a great team. We continue to invest in our expertise and infrastructure, both creative and technological, in order to create long-term success. As I said in my first earnings call, I'm a big believer in action speaking louder than words. So today, more than anything else I've said, it's our results that show we're gaining real traction. And there is a lot to be excited about in Q4 and beyond. Eric, over to you. Let me take it from the backwards. So no, we do not have a new deal with Spotify. So let me just clarify that upfront. We're not in relationship with the consumers. Our DSP partners are. So they are free to raise prices at any time without any contractual change. So it's not required in order to do so. I think as I look forward into the future -- obviously, you've heard me in my opening remarks talk about the value of music. And this being a first step in what I believe is a more regular cadence of increases. But let me give an example of what I think should happen more often and why. If you look at the history of Netflix and their innovation around price, it was really both on the way down and on the way up. Netflix started at $20 a month more than 20 years ago, then it went up to $22, and then it, over the course of many years, has innovated down to $19, $18, $17, $16, all the way down to $7.99. And then it started to grow it back up. And today, the standard plan is $15. I forget the name of the next plan. I hope with more family members on it, is $19, so close to $20. The level of innovation around price is incredible. And I think that the DSPs in the music space will begin on the same path, because the video services are showing us a price elasticity that consumer has that it is not resulting in elevated levels of churn. Now let me be clear. I am not suggesting that we go to $19 today. That is not what I'm saying. But what I'm pointing out is the innovation that is happening in the entertainment space, around it, the value that we all provide to users and the elasticity that is there. And we are -- we obviously want to make sure that we're working collaboratively together with our DSP partners to innovate over the next decade around this point. All right. Eric and I are shuffling with this thing. I won. So obviously, we can't share much, confidentiality, as I mentioned before. What I can tell you on the elements, obviously, I focused on value for us. And what is important to me is that whether it's in ad-supported or subscription, that we have fairness across all of our distributors so that nobody feels disadvantaged or advantaged in any way. And that we have a well-distributed distributor set of partners with all sort of feeling equal. And so that was an important tenant of the relationship with me -- with TikTok. But what I also wanted to make sure is that we focus on the users, on their users, because that is important to TikTok and any DSP for that matter. And I think it's important for music companies to focus on that equally in order to make it win-win. And I have to say that I'm very pleased with the way Shou, the TikTok CEO, has engaged and sought also a win-win deal for both sides. And I want to make sure that this impactful platform drives even more value for us in the future, because we're delivering the value to them as well. And I think we've achieved this between both parties. And -- but there's a lot of work to do for us to unleash even more opportunities, and we have a road map for that. So on the progress around DSPs. So the -- if you sort of step back, what I highlighted before is there is sort of disparity between the value that users receive by subscribing to music services and what it costs today, right? I've like I said in multiple times versus Netflix versus inflation, et cetera that's monthly. And the need for innovating around price optimization. And what has served the industry incredibly well for the past 15 years, was this collaboration about getting hundreds of millions of people -- multiple hundreds of millions of people into the premium experience, creating playlists and having stickiness and I'm in a great value prop. I don't think that is what will serve the industry well in the next 15 years. And we will all collectively have to focus on much more innovation around audience segmentation and price optimization and without negatively impacting any of the users, I should add. And that is not a thing that happens overnight or quarter-to-quarter. It's a carefully developed and orchestrated change that we will undergo, but don't expect news on that anytime soon. It takes time to unfold. And it takes multiple parties. It takes 2 to tango in this and more than 2 in this case. And -- but I'm very much focused on it, because I do think it is the right thing for all parties involved. And it's worth undergoing and do it in the most collaborative fashion possible. I forgot there was a second part of your question, which I'll pick up. Now TikTok, I think I said earlier that I can't give too many details on TikTok because of our confidentiality agreements. So, I get a lot of questions on it every time, you have massive user engagement, which TikTok has, right? It's been very successful in creating it. It creates new opportunities, not just for that company that has the consumer, but also for companies that work with it to develop new revenue streams off of this fan engagement. And whether that fan engagement is promotional in nature or economic and e-commerce driven, all of those are the possibilities. And what I wanted to establish is having a strong agreement with TikTok that gives us the license to both go deep together and innovate in the coming years. And that's what we're doing. So we're -- I can't really share any more details on that. But other than I'm very pleased to be partnered with them to partner with Shou and his team and off and running. Yes. So as you can imagine, we are deeply engaged with our distribution partners as well as with the generative AI engines. So it's like sort of 2 fronts that we're having lots of discussion and collaboration around. I always view this as both defensive and offensive. And that is one of the reasons I mentioned in my opening remarks, some of the great progress we're making around generative AI with some of our artists. And there's a lot more that is happening behind the scenes that I have not talked about. And because it's a creative tool. However, the thing that is important is that artists have a choice, because there are some that may not like it, and that's totally fine. And then there are some that will embrace it, and that's also fine. And we have to make sure that we ensure that they have a choice and that something is not done to them that is done with them. And so, that is my utmost priority here, because there's nothing more precious to an artist than their voice and protecting their voice is protecting their livelihood and protecting their persona. So, I want to make sure that we deliver on that. And at the same time, we deliver on opportunities that the tools can provide them. Sure. So first, I want to point out that we had -- we obviously had a great release slate with lots of momentum and lots of success. But at the same time, our catalog has also delivered, which is something that I tremendously appreciate. So it was -- we're kind of been firing on both engines, new release and catalog. We have a great slate for the next quarter. There's -- I would say the best way to think about this is that we entered the quarter with great success with Lil Uzi Vert, Gunna, Young Thug, Kelly Clarkson, aespa, and the Barbie Soundtrack, obviously, is a huge blockbuster. So our entry into the quarter has been great and our slate looks also very, very strong for Q4 and the rest of the year. There's lots of great new releases coming up from Burna Boy, Nino, PinkPantheress, Tiago PZK, Cali, Tiesto, Anne-Marie and so on and on and on. So -- and we have some new music coming from Zach Bryan and Dan and Shay, Sia, David Guetta, Charlie Puth, Robin Schulz, et cetera. So there's a lot of activity. The team is firing on all cylinders. And I'm just glad that we have reaccelerated and that we continue. Yes. I mean it's hard for me to guide for '24, just to sort of be in line with Eric on that. But what I can say is that Guy and Carianne have done a tremendous job over the past 4 years with Warner Chappell and run a very efficient and effective machine. They've diversified our services. They mine the catalog incredibly well. And we have 1 million -- more than 1 million songs that we're focusing on monetizing. And that takes some machine to do. And they're incredible operators and their results are really speaking for themselves. So obviously, I work with them very closely to set this up for the future and make sure that we continue, but I'm not prepared to guide on that into '24 as of today. But overall, I just want to close by saying I'm very grateful to the whole company to our teams, Hassel in the last quarter and in the current quarter, and it's great to see music speaking for itself and delivering the results. Thank you. So I want to thank you all for taking the time out of your day to dial in to our call for all of your thoughtful questions for challenging us on things. And again, I'm very appreciative to the entire team at Warner Music Group, and I look forward to our next earnings call with you. Have a great morning."

            "name": "Eric Levin",
            "content": "Thank you, Robert, and good morning, everyone. Our Q3 results are reflective of a robust release slate, strong carryover from a variety of artists across different genres and geographies, easing ad comps and outstanding performance in our publishing business. As a result, we delivered solid growth across key metrics, including revenue, adjusted OIBDA and adjusted OIBDA margin. Total revenue increased 10%, reflecting growth in both Recorded Music and Music Publishing. Adjusted OIBDA increased 18% with a margin of 19% compared to 17.6% in the prior year quarter. These increases were primarily due to strong operating performance and disciplined cost management. Our margin performance in the quarter was not materially impacted by savings from our March headcount reduction as we reinvested most of the savings into technology. Although, we anticipate that we will similarly reinvest most of those savings for the balance of this fiscal year, we are raising our guidance to deliver full year margin expansion at the high end of our 50 to 100 basis point range. Recorded Music revenue grew 9%. Streaming revenue increased 7%. Subscription streaming revenue grew in the low double-digits and ad-supported increased in the low single-digits. As Robert mentioned earlier, starting Q3 and going forward, when we talk about ad-supported streaming revenue, it will be inclusive of revenue from emerging streaming platforms. Our streaming results improved in each month of the quarter as we released new music. Additionally, the market-related ad-supported headwind moderated as we lapped the pressure we began to see in the prior year quarter. Physical revenue increased 2%, driven by solid performance in the U.S. Artist services and expanded rights revenue increased by 14% due to higher content promotion and merchandising revenue. Licensing revenue increased 24% driven by growth in sync and broadcast fees. Recorded Music adjusted OIBDA increased by 16% with a margin of 20.6%. This is an increase of 130 basis points compared to the prior year quarter. Music Publishing continues to deliver strong results, posting 16% revenue growth, driven by strength in digital and mechanical. Digital revenue grew 27% and streaming revenue increased 28%, reflecting the continued growth in streaming, digital deal renewals and a revenue true-up of $9 million. We had a $17 million benefit from the CRB rate increase in the prior year quarter, and we had a $7 million benefit in the current quarter. Performance revenue decreased by 9% due to the timing of payments from collection societies. Mechanical revenue increased by 45%, primarily due to a higher share of physical sales and timing of distributions. Sync was flat due to lower commercial licensing activity, offset by copyright infringement settlements. Music Publishing adjusted OIBDA increased 32% to $74 million with margin increasing 310 basis points to 26.1%, driven by strong operating performance. In April, we successfully launched certain components of our financial transformation program in select territories. The program remains on track to meaningfully roll out in a wave-based approach and with expanded functionalities during fiscal 2023, 2024 and into 2025. Once fully implemented, we expect the program to yield annualized run rate savings of $35 million to $40 million. Q3 CapEx decreased to $33 million as compared to $35 million in the prior year quarter. Operating cash flow decreased 10% to $146 million from $163 million in the prior year quarter due to higher cash taxes and cash interest. Free cash flow decreased 12% to $113 million from $128 million in the prior year quarter. Adjusted OIBDA to operating cash flow conversion was 49% in Q3. Our goal remains to deliver an operating cash conversion of 50% to 60% over a multiyear period, and we expect to achieve this target for 2023. As of June 30, we had a cash balance of $600 million, total debt of approximately $4 billion and net debt of $3.4 billion. Our weighted average cost of debt is 4.1% and our nearest maturity date is in 2028. As we look ahead, we expect continued improvement in our results. We are working hard to execute against our plan and look forward to sharing more about fiscal 2024 on our next earnings call. Thank you to everyone for joining us today. We'll now open the call for questions. Ben, this is Eric. I'll take that. So I think the first thing to note is that we did a restructuring, reduced headcount this year, are getting meaningful savings from that. Our technology investments are really being funded by those savings, not coming out of margin. So that's the first point. The second point is at the IPO, we had a long-term projection of 100 basis points increase per year on average in margin. We have largely met that. We're saying we're going to meet that again in '23. I will say that as we look forward, we are focused on margin increases. We are working on our '24 budget now, so I don't have anything specific to say for '24. I will say that we actively -- Robert, myself, the business team actively worked on a game plan for OIBDA growth and margin improvement within fiscal '23. We're working collectively as a team. Early in the year, I said 50 to 100 basis points was realistic for this year. Now, we're confirming the high end of that range as our objective, as our goal for the year. And that is largely through active management of the business. Both revenue growth -- we saw reaccelerated digital growth in Recorded this year and extraordinary performance in our Publishing division, both with growing margins and active cost management, not just in headcount, but also areas like marketing that allow us to achieve this strong margin growth. So we as a team will continue to look at growth in the business, both top line and margin. Where exactly it will land in '24, we'll report in future quarters as we finalize our budget. But it's very much in the center of our focus. Sure. Go ahead you start. Go ahead start, Robert. Yes. Let me add a few things. One is -- and again, consistent with what Robert said and how our philosophy is, having services that compete with each other that our monetization is in line so that we're not incented to support one service versus another, but to provide the best content we can across all services and let their competition in the market determine where audiences go. So we're achieving our objective as we do these deals. TikTok is an example of that. It also opens up new growth drivers as they roll out subscription services and then other products that they want to. What I will say is we have been saying for quite some time that we've had emerging streaming deals that were concluded in 2021 that we expected renewals in '23 and '24. This obviously is a substantive one of them. What we will say is that this is happening pretty much when we expected and in line with where we would have expected this to. So this is really consistent with our model and our forecast. And we're really pleased this deal concluded, and Robert said in good partnerships. So we move forward. So a few -- so the first thing is, this is the first quarter -- and hopefully, this simplifies things for folks out there. We know that it's been something we've had to explain in components in the past. We're now combining the emerging streaming category and the traditional ad-supported streaming category combined, which is how we know others report this as well. We have seen improvement in the -- in that category sequentially as the market improves, specifically for ad-supported services. You see that in the reporting -- of public reporting of some of the services that we have licenses with. So we're seeing this as a continued category of improvement quarter-to-quarter. We see the emerging subset, more the social gaming subset that's continuing to show upside and opportunity and growth. And the traditional ad side, which was declining for the past year or so, really starting to come back into a positive growth environment. So across the board, we've been pleased. And again, as we've said, as I said before, we had a series of renewals that are coming up in '23 and '24. TikTok being one that we talked about publicly that was just done, noting that, that didn't affect our Q3 results, but that deal was done in our fiscal Q4 and we'll see that in our fiscal Q4. This is Eric. I'm happy to take the question. So I think you are right. When you look at -- traditionally, when you look at -- I mean at the time of our IPO, just looking back a couple of years, when you looked at what's going to drive streaming growth, it was the numerical growth in subscribers, it was literally subscription growth. Now, it's a multipronged growth engine. It continues to be subscriptions, but now it's not just developed markets. Emerging markets have accelerated their growth in subscriptions pricing. We've seen in the past year pricing come pretty much across the board now for all -- virtually all substantive distributors. You're seeing emerging streaming continue to grow with positive renewals, reaffirming the category and it's potential You're seeing the traditional ad-supported streaming that was affected by economic weakness starting to improve and get back to positive growth. So we're seeing a series of growth drivers in streaming, all of which are seeing positive momentum. As far as the number that, that growth will hit in the short-term, I wouldn't want to give that forecast there. Many third-parties that publish numbers there, I would ask you to look at, study and evaluate their assumptions. But I would say that as we were -- as we're entering fiscal '20 -- almost entering fiscal '24 versus '23, the environment across the board has become meaningfully more positive and optimistic as far as the variety of growth drivers and the strength of the growth drivers. So we do agree with you that there's real positive momentum out there, Kutgun. Okay. A lot of questions packed in there, Sebastiano. Nice to hear from you. All right. Let me try to tackle that. I think I've got 3 groups of questions. So one is financial transformation -- what we're trying to communicate there is a few things. 1 is that it's launched. It is live. We have several markets now using the new technology successfully, and that is fantastic. It is working and functional in a few markets. What we have done is adjusted our launch schedule to come in waves across fiscal '23, '24 and into fiscal '25. This will allow us to make sure that we have the proper support and hyper-care as each segment of markets is rolled out to make sure that it is successful. And that as we do this, we have the ability to use the new processes and tools successfully with the right training, the right controls. So it's a very thorough launch plan phasing over time. As we roll out, the benefits will roll in with it. Obviously, a substantial portion of the benefits happen when it is global. So some of the benefits will roll in, in '24, although a very modest amount, larger in '25. And once it's rolled out in '25, the benefits we expect to be robust for fiscal '26. You asked the questions about margin, I'm not sure 100% got it. What I will say about fiscal '23 is that the acceleration of digital and streaming revenue in the second half of '23, which is high-margin revenue is a great boost and our active cost management is allowing us to meet the high end of the range, which is what we've been looking at in prior years, not every year is exactly the same. I don't have an analytical like-for-like comparison sitting in front of me. But every year, we are looking for the opportunities to achieve the high end of the range, depending on the mix of releases distributed versus owned artist services and its rate of growth, which is lower revenue every year has a slightly different profile. But as we look at and we'll look at in the '24 budget, look at the profile of '24s revenue and the margins of that revenue and build the best plan for the year, we can with margin growth as one of the things we are actively managing. Your last question was now that we're reporting emerging streaming and ad-supported together, I think you want us to give some color on each piece. What we'll say is that in emerging streaming, there were no notable new deals in '23, the TikTok deal -- I'm sorry, in Q3 of '23. The TikTok deal commences in Q4. The category in emerging streaming continue to grow nicely, I would say, well into the teens and as supported continued to show sequential improvement heading back towards growth. And so hopefully, that gives you the color that you want Sebastiano. Thanks, Matthew. So I'll take the second one first, because they pretty much net out to 0. The 2 most substantive things in Publishing was the revenue true-up in streaming and the CRB on a records 3, which has now been finalized at the kind of backlog revenue impact now that it's able to be calculated. The revenue true-up was a positive. The CRB, although there was a positive this quarter. The prior year was a positive -- it was $10 million more. So when you net that all out, it all nets to 0, the streaming revenue growth of 28% in publishing is about what it is once you net out all those true-ups. So it's really kind of negate each other. On the price increases on the recorded side, I would really say to expect the benefit of those or the full benefit of those in fiscal '24. And Spotify's announced rate increase as an example, it takes a few months to execute, rollout to their consumers and then roll that into our numbers. So, I'd expect to see the price increases roll through our numbers in fiscal '24, not I don't think realistically in Q4 '23. I'd say it's too early for us or me to make a definitive statement there. I think some of that depends on the release schedule, which markets it skewed towards some markets have higher need to break local music and a higher marketing demand when some products come out in -- with partners or partnerships of how they're released it creates efficiencies in marketing. So it depends on the release schedule for next year. Obviously, as you see from this year, we're very actively looking at evaluating and managing costs, including marketing. And as we look forward, we will continue to -- with great discipline, evaluate and manage those. But I wouldn't want to yet call a specific permanent lower variable marketing. I will say that we're very actively looking to manage and improve margins, and that is one of the significant tools that you have to use."

At the request of Warner Music Group, today's call is being recorded for replay purposes. And if you object, you may disconnect at any time. Now, I would like to turn today's call over to your host, Mr. Kareem Chin, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nKareem Chin: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Warner Music Group's Fiscal Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Please note that our earnings press release, earnings snapshot and the Form 10-Q we filed this morning will be available on our website. On today's call, we have our CEO, Robert Kyncl; and our CFO, Eric Levin, who will take you through our results and then will answer your questions.

And with that, I will turn it over to Robert.\nRobert Kyncl: Thanks, Kareem. And good morning, everyone. It's been four months since I joined Warner Music Group from Google, and I'd like to talk today about some changes we've made so far and shed some light on what's to come. But first, let me give you a summary of our Q2 results. As expected, on our last earnings call, some of the macroeconomic, currency and release slate headwinds from Q1 carried over into Q2. As a result, total revenue grew 5% and adjusted OIBDA increased 8%. Recorded Music revenue increased 3% and Streaming grew 2%, reflecting ongoing weakness in the ad market and modest growth in the United States. Music Publishing had another impressive quarter with revenue growth of 15%. Our strategy at Warner Chappell continues to deliver long-lasting relationships with a wide array of global and local talent, while expanding our services to songwriters and creating new opportunities for catalog. This quarter, highlights included our creative partnership with Belgian superstar, Stromae max contributions as a co-producer of Bad Bunny's latest album, and 21 Savage's collaboration with Drake on the number-one album, Her Loss. I promised I would be direct with you, so I'll simply say that while our results in Music Publishing were best-in-class, we underperformed in Recorded Music. There's plenty of room for improvement and we're addressing both company-specific and industry-wide issues. As we signaled, we have had two consecutive quarters where our release schedule was less robust than normal. That is now changing with the slate we have planned for the remainder of 2023. The early results are promising with new releases from the likes of Ed Sheeran, Jack Harlow, and Tiesto. I'll give some more details later on. While we are optimistic that our second half release slate will drive better results in the second half, this recovery may be gradual during the balance of the year. Overall, we're confident in our ability to return to a better cadence of releases, which should lead to more consistent results. At the same time, the music industry continues to morph, creating some risks and even more opportunities. This includes questions around the future of the streaming model and the rise of AI. It only increases our conviction in the tech-enabled strategies that will differentiate Warner Music Group. On our last earnings call, I said that we would be reallocating resources to accelerate our use of technology to empower artists and songwriters, as well as drive greater impact and efficiency in our business. In March, we made some tough but necessary decisions. We announced an approximately 4% reduction in our workforce that will yield annual savings of $49 million. We'll see approximately $20 million of savings in the remainder of this fiscal year. I want to be clear that this was not straightforward cost-cutting. We'll be reinvesting a significant portion of these savings into new expertise and tech initiatives that will drive company-wide benefits in the coming years. I want to frame for you how we're going to position Warner Music Group for long-term success in a highly proactive, fiscally responsible way. The demand for music is ubiquitous, and as the use cases multiply, the opportunities on the horizon are bigger and more wide-ranging than ever. Many of the key ingredients for our long-term success are already in place. We have incredible artists and songwriters and one-of-a-kind Cadillac of iconic music. We have the expertise, resources and reach to both artist careers and brands. But having said that, I don't underestimate our challenges either. The pace of change is faster, the competition for talent is fiercer, the world is growing noisier and attention spans are getting shorter. If we are to maximize our opportunities and solve our challenges, we need to add great technology into our mix. And it can be tools we borrow from someone else, it's got to be proprietary, central part of our value proposition. Technology can be our force multiplier, a force multiplier for the skills and the capabilities of our team in service of our artists, songwriters and our catalog. It's not going to happen overnight, but long term, we're looking at music and technology as the twin engines of our success. I'd like to tell you a bit more about our plan, starting as always with the music. Today, the majority of the music industry's revenues come from a relatively small fraction of the world's population. That makes growth potential in emerging markets enormous. This March, IFPI released a list of fastest-growing recorded music markets. I was pleased to note that we've been expanding our presence in these regions for years by appointing new leadership, opening additional offices and partnering with influential local players. The recorded music industry's fastest-growing region in 2022 was Sub-Saharan Africa, jumping 35%. It's an area that's full of incredibly diverse, dynamic music cultures and we've been steadily ramping up our A&R activities there for the past five years. Key moves have including acquiring Africa's leading independent distributor, Africori, at the start of last year. We now contend for market leadership, driven by the success of artists like CKay, Burna Boy, Master KG and Inkabi Zezwe as well. The next three fastest-growing regions for the recorded music industry in 2022 were China, up 28%; MENA, up 24%; and Latin America, up 26%. In both China and MENA, our revenue growth outperformed the market in Q2. And in Latin America, we're taking the necessary steps to catch up and gain share. We have a great story to tell about how we're enhancing our profile in each of these key regions. In China, Warner Music Group has led the way as far back as 2014 by acquiring the Gold Typhoon catalog and by being the first major music company to partner with Tencent. In MENA, we established our regional office over five years ago and we've since leapfrogged our competitors through deals with Rotana and Qanawat. In Latin America, we've rejuvenated our A&R strategy. Our breakout artists include Mexico's Yng Lvcas, who is currently number three on global Spotify chart. We're also looking to expand our presence in fast-growing genres. This April, the Annual Report for the International Music Summit reveals that the dance music industry generated revenue of $11.3 billion in 2022, an increase of 34% from 2021. We're fully primed to capitalize on this trend. Since 2017, we've acquired Spinnin' Records, launched new labels, including Major Recordings in the US, and Whet Records in Asia, and partnered with dance music legend, Patrick Moxey. In 2021, we acquired the catalog of French superstar DJ producer, David Guetta, and signed a new deal with him for future recordings. Amazingly, David, who released his first album in 2002, was the most streamed dance artist in 2021, 2022 and so far in 2023. On technology, we're still evolving our plan, but let me share a glimpse into my vision. As the music industry transitions from physical to digital, it continues to focus on high-touch areas it's always been good at and underinvested in its tech capabilities. These are the capabilities we're forging here under the guidance of Ariel Bardin, our new President of Technology. We're building the leadership, the team and the culture that will bring an unprecedented level of tech expertise to the music business. As we look ahead, here is what you should expect us to do. Number one, create efficiency by enhancing our systems and decision making so we free up resources for higher ROI opportunities. Number two, increase our effectiveness as brand managers for our artists and songwriters. Number three, grow scale through services for greater range and number of artists and songwriters all on one tech stack. And number four, evolving our products to better monetize the artists' and songwriters' superfan relationship. Switching to monetization. As I've said before, music is undervalued. This is something we intend to change in order to create a healthier ecosystem for artists, songwriters, the streaming services, and us. Recent price increases have been successful and are a move in the right direction, but they should be just the first step. Those subscription services which have raised prices have done the fiscally prudent thing for themselves, their shareholders and the creative community. There is no sign that they are seeing elevated churn. At the same time, WMG has started to experiment with different streaming models. I cannot name all these services as the deal terms are confidential, but this is just the beginning, and we will continue to collaborate with our partners on new paradigms. When it comes to generative AI, it needs to be put into proper context. Framing it only as a threat is inaccurate. Our first priority is to vigorously enforce our copyrights and our rights to name, image, likeness and voice to defend the originality of our artists and songwriters. It is crucial that any AI-generative platform discloses what their AI is trained on, and this must happen all around the world. Europe is leading by example with the EU Artificial Intelligence Act. The European Parliament is considering amendments which would codify the position that copyrighted content may not be used to train AI without prior authorization from rights-holders and would require AI developers to disclose a summary of the materials they used to train AI. As in Europe, all around the world lawmakers are debating AI, but the primary focus has been issues such as transparency, safety, algorithmic bias, privacy protection, notice to consumers and an ability to opt-out. Last month, Senator Chuck Schumer announced his intention to drive the US AI bill coming later this year. I can promise you that whenever and wherever there is a legislative initiative on AI, we will be there in force to ensure the protection of intellectual property is high on the agenda. However, we must also see and seize the massive opportunity that generative AI will also be. Consider this, user-generated content containing copyrighted material was originally viewed as a big threat by media companies. From my personal experience at YouTube when I arrived in 2010, we were fighting many lawsuits around the world and were generating low tens of millions of dollars from UGC. We turned that liability into a billion-dollar opportunity in just a handful of years and the multiple in dollar revenue stream over time. In 2022, YouTube announced that it paid out over $2 billion from UGC to music rights-holders alone and far more across all other content industries. AI is just like any emerging technology, there will be challenges and opportunities. And with the proper expertise, it will be a powerful tool for the music industry, and we intend to be there at the forefront on how to best deploy it. Before I hand it over to Eric, I wanted to say that our strong second half slate has begun to take shape. On Friday, immediately following a victorious outcome in the baseless copyright infringement case lodged against him, Ed Sheeran dropped his acclaimed new album, Subtract. The first single, Eyes Closed, which you may have heard on our pre-call hold music, became Ed's 14th number one single in the UK. The album has already hit number one in 41 countries on iTunes, while physical preorders have outstripped the numbers for Ed's last album in multiple territories. We're seeing encouraging signs from other recent releases. Rap superstar Jack Harlow surprise-dropped a new album on April 28 and it's already racked up over 70 million streams. While Tiesto released his new album on April 21 and quickly went Double Platinum in Brazil and Norway. FIFTY FIFTY's Cupid, and Yng Lvcas's La Bebe Remix, have been two of the hardest streaming singles. Our releases from across the globe occupy four of the top 10 spots on the Spotify Top 50 USA Chart, with all four coming from outside the US, highlighting how we're bringing local artists to a global stage. Additionally, we have new music from Dua Lipa, David Guetta, Lil Uzi Vert, Burna Boy, Kelly Clarkson, Tiago PZK, and Bailey Zimmerman, and many more in the months to come. I'm very confident in the path forward as we combine creative and marketing excellence with tech innovation to propel our growth. Finally, in March, Eric announced that he will retire by the end of the calendar year. We started the process of searching for his successor, but we're fortunate that he will be with us for a while longer. I'll give you an update on the search in the coming months. For now, I will turn it over to Eric to take you through our results and then will answer your questions.\nEric Levin: Thank you, Robert. And good morning, everyone. Despite the challenges Robert cited, we delivered growth in revenue, adjusted OIBDA and adjusted OIBDA margin. Total revenue increased 4.6%, reflecting growth in both Recorded Music and Music Publishing. Adjusted OIBDA increased 7.9% with margin of 20.4% compared to 19.8% in the prior-year quarter. These increases were primarily due to higher revenue and lower variable marketing spend which is linked to the timing of releases. Recorded Music revenue grew 2.5%. Streaming revenue increased 2.2% as subscription streaming grew in the mid-single-digits and was partially offset by ad-supported revenue declining in the mid-teens. Our streaming results reflect a lighter release schedule and market-related slowdown in ad-supported revenue. Physical revenue increased 1%, driven by solid performance in the US. Artist services and expanded rights revenue decreased by 4% due to lower merchandising and advertising revenue, partially offset by higher concert promotion revenue. Licensing revenue increased 27%, including growth in brand income and the licensing settlement. Recorded Music adjusted OIBDA increased by 2% with a margin of 21.8%, which was roughly flat compared to the prior-year quarter. Music Publishing continues to deliver impressive results, posting 15% revenue growth, driven by strength in digital, performance and mechanical. Digital revenue grew 18%, the same for streaming revenue, driven by continued growth in streaming and the impact of digital deal renewals. Performance revenue increased by 29% primarily due to the timing of payments from collection societies and the remaining recovery from COVID disruption. Performance revenue is now fully recovered from COVID, and we expect the growth to moderate meaningfully starting next quarter. Mechanical revenue increased 23% primarily due to a strong share in physical sales, and sync decreased by 4% due to lower commercial licensing activity in the US, partially offset by copyright infringement settlements. Music Publishing adjusted OIBDA increased 25% to $76 million, with margin increasing 240 basis points to 29.6%, driven by strong operating performance. In March, we announced an approximately 4% reduction in headcount that will generate annual savings of $49 million starting in fiscal '24. We expect to realize $20 million of these savings in fiscal '23. In connection with these headcount reductions, there were non-recurring restructuring charges in the quarter of $41 million for severance costs. The cash outflows related to these costs will occur through the end of fiscal 2024. In April, we successfully launched certain components of our financial transformation program in select territories. The program remains on track to meaningfully rollout in a wave-based approach throughout the globe and with expanded functionalities during fiscal '23 and '24, yielding expected annualized run-rate savings of $35 million to $40 million once fully implemented. Q2 CapEx increased to $35 million as compared to $28 million in the prior-year quarter, mainly due to investments in IT capabilities. Operating and free cash flow were both a use of cash in Q2. Operating cash flow decreased to a use of $6 million from a source of $44 million in the prior-year quarter because of higher income and withholding tax payments primarily due to higher estimated US taxable income, the utilization of certain remaining tax credits in the prior-year quarter and other movements in working capital. Free cash flow decreased to a use of $41 million from $16 million in the prior-year quarter. As a reminder, our working capital will fluctuate from quarter to quarter, but our goal remains to deliver an operating cash flow conversion ratio of 50% to 60% over a multi-year period. As of March, we had a cash balance of $601 million, total debt of $4 billion, and net debt of $3.4 billion. Our weighted average cost of debt is 4% and our nearest maturity date is in 2028. We expect growth to reaccelerate in the back half of the fiscal year, driven by our robust release schedule. In Q3, we've already had successful releases from Ed Sheeran, Jack Harlow, and Tiesto. We look forward to more releases from some of our biggest stars and our next generation of talent from across the globe as we progress through the remainder of the fiscal year. We continue to position ourselves for long-term success, and we're reallocating resources to ensure we evolve our business in a fast, smart and accretive way. Thank you to everyone for joining us today. We'll now open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Morris with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.\nMichael Morris: Thank you, guys. Good morning. Robert, I'd like to ask you a little bit more about the DSP pricing progression that you touched on in your prepared remarks. And I'd specifically love to hear your thoughts about Spotify. So you mentioned a couple of your partners who have already raised prices. And on their earnings call, Spotify management said that they would like to raise price in '23, but that it's pending discussion with their music partners, their label partners. So can you share any insights on your discussion with Spotify and if you see a path to collaborating on the price increase there? And then secondly, if I could, Eric. As we think about the stronger release slate in the second half of the fiscal year, can you help us with how much you think the key categories of Recorded Music revenue and I guess streaming revenue in particular will be impacted relative to the first half? Thank you.\nRobert Kyncl: Thanks, Michael. So on the first part of your question, there's no real update that I can provide you because those discussions are private, obviously. And when there is some update, I will make sure to share that. But what I can tell you is this, which is, one, I'm excited that they're sounding constructive publicly about the price increases on their earnings call. But more importantly, actually I think it was you who published a report that the price increase would result in EUR1 billion uplift in annual revenue for Spotify in 2024, which obviously is quite positive and accretive. So clearly there will be a win-win, not just for Spotify and us, but also for every DSP if price increases happen. That's really - that's all I have to say about that at this point.\nEric Levin: So thanks, Robert. And good to talk to you, Michael. So on the kind of release slate and first half versus second half and the impact, I think we feel - as we've said and signaled before, our release slate was a little lighter in the first two quarters of the year and will be quite weighted towards Q3 and Q4. As we said on the call, we already have some releases out of Q3, Sheeran, Jack Harlow, Tiesto, that are already showing strong results with a lot more to come. We have the Barbie soundtrack featuring Dua Lipa, which we're excited about Tebi Rex and music, David Guetta, Charlie Puth. Yng Lvcas out of Mexico is the top three Spotify hit. We can keep going and going. The point is that the releases are there, and the second half is looking quite strong. We absolutely expect this to improve our results in Recorded Music streaming in the second half of the year, and this would likely create uplift in both streaming and physical. Those two categories are the ones that would be most positively affected, Michael.\nMichael Morris: Thank you both.\nEric Levin: Sure. Thank you.\nRobert Kyncl: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nBen Swinburne: Thanks, good morning. Robert, with another quarter under your belt there, I'm wondering if you could update us a bit on some of the technology opportunities you see at the company and sort of where you think the biggest - I don't know if it's efficiency or optimization potential is as you've brought on a new team and sort of worked for at least another quarter on building out systems at Warner. And then, you guys, I think, made a comment in your prepared remarks, you expect a gradual recovery in the second half. Do you think that we should be assuming that the major labels are growing slower than the industry on a go-forward basis because of just the growth of independents, maybe throw in some AI-generated music in there, maybe the sort of regional skew towards non-Western markets? Is that the right base case assumption? Because obviously we've sort of seen results across the major labels kind of lag Spotify on a revenue growth basis. And I'm curious, do you think maybe that's the right assumption going forward? So those are the two questions. Thank you.\nRobert Kyncl: Well, thanks. So on a technology front, I think in my opening remarks I highlighted the four areas that technology will impact Warner. 100% focused on efficiency. There is a lot that we can achieve using technology on that front. 100% focused on effectiveness of all of our activities, scale and then focus on monetization of superfans. It is - every area of our business that I look at can use technology as a force multiplier. So what we're doing is, A, we've recruited the initial team of just A-list technologists which are unprecedented in this music industry. And we're having an incredible momentum with hiring more and more people of that type that want to come here and be part of what we're doing. And at the same time, we're looking at all the activities inside the company, all the projects, and see how we apply them against the four areas that I was talking about. I think this is incredibly exciting, and I like to say is that we have to constantly parallel process on everything. This is the greatest example. We're parallel processing in four different areas with technology. And what's even more encouraging is that the music part of the company is embracing it in the most welcoming sense because everyone sees what a force multiplier this can be on all of our activities that we do developing artists and marketing artists and songwriters. So it's an exciting journey to be part of. And I can't underscore enough how unprecedented this is, but obviously time will - we will have to prove it through our products that we ship and our actual deliveries. I prefer actions speaking louder than words. So I look forward to, at some point in the future, be actually prove that, but I'm incredibly confident about this. Your second question on majors and sort of non-Western markets. So I'm just about four months in on this, so I'll reserve any sort of absolute statements on these things because there's still a lot to unpack. What I can tell you is that music is far more global than it's ever been. And what I mean by that is that it comes from everywhere. The rise of local music in markets all around the world is undeniable. I've seen it from my seat at YouTube for many years. I'm glad that Warner has been investing over the past many years. And alongside this strategy, I highlighted some of that in my opening remarks, the Middle East and other - and China and other markets. And I think it's an incredibly exciting time for music because of that. As it relates to - so we're leaned into it. Obviously, I'm very, very focused on making sure that we succeed all around the world, not just with distribution, but with sourcing of content, discover new talent and helping them become global stars and global superstars. On majors versus indies, I think I touched on this on the last earnings call. Obviously, as there is more and more music being uploaded, that can put some pressure on us, but all the same tools that everyone has at their disposal are the tools that we have at our disposal. So I would not go to any foregone conclusion on long-term market share loss on that.\nBen Swinburne: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Sebastiano Petti with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nSebastiano Petti: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to see if you could touch on just, Robert, in some of your prepared remarks, the investments in tech capabilities and the tech-enabled strategies. I mean, what is the glide path, as we look at capital expenditures after the implementation of the financial transformation program. Should we expect a step-down in fiscal 2024 or will there maybe be some of these initiatives or some of these programs and reinvestment of cost savings that will still be felt inside of fiscal '24 and perhaps beyond? And then my second question just on the Warner Chappell, obviously segment OIBDA growth very strong in the quarter. Streaming, you talked about in your prepared remarks just the strong execution there. I mean, can you unpack perhaps some of the underlying drivers of that growth? How should we think about the segment growth from here on a go-forward basis, any underlying maybe one-offs or comps that are impacting the recent kind of growth rates? Thank you.\nRobert Kyncl: All right, I'll throw it to Eric. I think he is better suited to answer here. Go ahead, Eric.\nEric Levin: Thanks. So hi, Sebastiano. Great to talk to you again. And on CapEx, I would say a few things. So we are absolutely, kind of with Robert and the tech team, developing, we'll call it the updated plan that shows increased investment in tech and tech capabilities to drive the business forward. So as our financial transformation starts to wind down and costs come down, I would reasonably expect that our tech investment and CapEx costs are higher than they were historically. So whether that yields to something that stays relatively flat, but I would expect it to be $100 million or more of the exact numbers over a long-term plan, will come out as we finalize our strategic plan and the financial plans that goes with it, which are still in-flight with Robert, and Ariel, and the new team still developing the plans forward. So I think more to come, but certainly there will be increased investment in technology. That said, some of the cost measures that we've taken, specifically the headcount reductions, which are going to generate $49 million of savings in fiscal '24 and annually thereafter, our objective is for the technology costs to basically be funded by other cost-savings measures. So it's not incremental cost to the business. It is just a reallocation of resources to where it could have more impact and drive growth and efficiency in the business. So the plan and details are in-flight, but the strategy is clear and already taking place. On OIBDA growth, Sebastiano, I think it's fair, as you look at the business, to say that our first half ago fiscal year had a lighter release schedule, which meant that it was very imperative for us to be managing costs very tightly and prudently, looking at every single line of the business, whether it's overhead, marketing, to make sure the cost being spent and what was deployed was having impact in the market. And because of that, we managed our margins and our OIBDA growth and EBITDA growth quite carefully and we're able to deliver solid bottom-line growth. And obviously, we'll continue to manage the business with financial discipline. But as we look at the second half of the year and a deployment in the market of a significant amount of high-end music, you should expect us to support that with marketing appropriately to continue to make sure we're driving the impact in growth in the business. But we'll continue to look at all cost lines to make sure we're driving opportunity for OIBDA growth, and we continue to focus on driving the business for margin growth over a sustainable period of time. That said, if we look at specific business lines on. Recorded Music, I would look at opportunities to improve streaming growth in the second half of the year. I think sync, which has been affected by the ad market downturn and the production of commercials, we'll be looking carefully to see how the economy responds and how ad markets and commercial production responds. And we'll be very close to that market. And if there's an opportunity to reaccelerate that growth like we did in '22, we'll be pushing that pedal hard. As we look at the publishing side of the business. Warner Chappell has continued really solid teens growth, and we expect Warner Chappell to continue very strong growth. I would say, on Warner Chappell, two things. One is that the performance line, which has had outsized growth, because its recovery from COVID has taken multiple years is about at the end of its recovery line, is about where it was pre-COVID. And we still expect that to be a growth area, but at a slower pace. But digital, specifically driven by big streaming market growth, we continue to expect to see which - and streaming is now our largest revenue line by far in Warner Chappell. We expect that to continue its strong growth trends going forward, driving the market and the effective strategies of the Chappell management team, which have been outpacing market growth in streaming. So we see a strong growth profile going forward for Warner Chappell and opportunity for acceleration of key lines on Recorded. Thanks, Sebastiano.\nSebastiano Petti: Thanks, Eric. See you soon.\nEric Levin: Yes.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Benjamin Black with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nBenjamin Black: Good morning, thanks for the questions. Robert, I know you spoke a lot about technologies, but UMG has been very vocal about the need to sort of redefine the DSP model is the one that's not more artist-centric. So I was curious, what are your thoughts on the way the model is currently constructed and do you think there is need for a change? And if so, how would you like to see the industry evolve? And then one on sort of advertising, it'd be great to hear sort of an update on the advertising backdrop and trends that you're seeing in early April. Are you seeing growing stabilization and the latest - has the ad's market dislocation impacted the pace of your emerging platform deals since many of these are tethered to the ad market? Thank you.\nRobert Kyncl: Yes, so on the DSP model. So I think I've said publicly a few times that I am convinced, and various numbers back up, that music is significantly undervalued. For instance, relative to streaming video, roughly $0.50 on a $1 by multiple different analyses or versus inflation, et cetera. So it is undervalued. When I look at that, I start thinking about like what are the underlying causes of that. And a great example of that is my own work at YouTube, where over the course of five years, we have increased the price of YouTube TV subscription by 100% and we have not increased the price of YouTube Music by any percent. Same people, two completely different decisions, two completely different outcomes. And by the way, both businesses grew very successfully. And the cause of that is the structure of the agreements with DSPs. That structure was really, really good for the industry. It has taken it from a low point to an incredible recurring revenue stream all around the world with massive amounts of people and have payment instruments on file, premium experience, personalization, all of that, and then has rebuilt the business. But it does not mean that it is the right thing for the next 10 or 20 years. It has to change, and it will change. One of the reasons for that is that there is not a real incentive for price increases that you see in every other industry. But the other is that every stream is valued exactly the same way. And that doesn't seem like something that's aligned with the way the world works. For instance, in sports, LeBron James earns more money than some of his teammates, not because he plays more hours per day. Plays exactly the same number of hours, but yet he earns more. ESPN commands more money per subscriber per month than any other TV channel, not because it's consumed more. There is propensity to pay, there is users' willingness to remain with the overall services, et cetera. So it can be that Ed Sheeran's stream is worth exactly the same thing than a stream of rain falling on the roof. I think you're catching my drift, kind of where I'm going. I think we have a misaligned model at this point. Now that the industry has - is healthy and has grown incredibly well, I think it's time to re-evaluate how we're licensing to DSPs, do it together with them because these - there are ways to make all of this win-win. But music cannot be the only industry that doesn't assign value to high-value artists and songwriters, that it doesn't drive ARPU growth the way every other industry does. So I'm not trying to limit the volume of content. I understand that's important for personalization and choice. I'm looking to change the value equation, the way it works today, and put in new incentives. But it's too early to talk about any other specifics, but you can imagine it is one of the top priorities for me personally to change.\nEric Levin: And I'm happy to take the advertising ones. So, Ben, on that one, I guess I would say we're seeing some positive signs, but I would continue to be cautious. I think in calendar Q1, we saw YouTube and Meta have some improved results. I think as we've talked about our stronger release schedule in the second half of the year gives us optimism that advertising has the opportunity to do better in Q3. We will start to have easier comps, as in Q3 of '22 was when the market started to soften and then in Q4 '22 is when it softened significantly. And so we are more optimistic going forward, but I would also say that in prior quarters, we've seen a stronger month or two and then a month that has been much weaker within a quarter. So I think we want to see a pattern of improvement before we really believe that the market has stabilized, but there are some signs of improvement out there. And with our stronger release schedule and easier comps, I think we feel much better about the second half of the year than the results from the first half of the year on advertising.\nBenjamin Black: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Greenfield with LightShed Partners. Your line is now open. Rich Greenfield, your line is open. Please check your mute button.\nRich Greenfield: Hi, can you hear me? Sorry about that.\nRobert Kyncl: Yes, we can.\nRich Greenfield: Sorry about that, Robert. I just want to expand on your last answer, Robert, because I think it's so important, thinking about sort of the future of this industry. And part of the issue at YouTube TV is you had obviously a lot of legacy cable companies that were charging $100-plus a month versus a much lower price. You had a lot of stealing in order to grow price as a low-cost new entrant. With the music industry, you sort of have everybody sort of at the same price point within a dollar, I guess, of everybody, but you don't have anybody - you don't have a lot of stealing to sort of grow and so - and we're even seeing people who had sort of like new ideas. You saw Resso come in, and they just got rid of their ad-supported service and go sort of subscription-only. How do you think about the evolution? Like should this be a hybrid model of advertising and subscription, should there be more of an advertising-only model, a subscription-only? Like what do you think of the future of the - what's the business model of music look like in five or 10 years that you think we're moving towards?\nRobert Kyncl: Yes, so I think there are two different things. One is sort of the user experience and the value proposition, which is, I think, more what you were touching on. And then there is the sort of wholesale relationship between us and the DSPs. So what I was talking about previously was the change of the wholesale relationship which is necessary going forward. But I do think that evolution of the - well, let's say the retailer relationship between the DSPs and the users is always open. And I think dual revenue stream models are great. I think you always need a premium version as well. Obviously, we've experimented with all of that at YouTube. I do think the experimentation with paid models that have ads in it is also important, right? Obviously, we've seen that with Hulu successfully as their most adopted tier despite having the completely ad-free option. So I think I think innovation around the use cases for users is important because it basically helps optimize audience segmentation, right, along different price points and different ARPUs. And we're 100% open to exploring all of these things with our partners. But what I'm trying to stress is that the status quo of the way things work right now is not something that's going to work going forward. And I think - yes, go ahead.\nRich Greenfield: Just to dig in on that. Is the issue that the way the wholesale relationship works makes an advertising business model or other hybrid business models not as appealing? Is that what you're essentially saying needs to get fixed, is by changing wholesale you enable new retail models?\nRobert Kyncl: Yes and no. One, even if nothing changed on the user proposition, the wholesale relationship has to change because today, it does not increase - does not incentivize price increases. And as you've seen in every single subscription service, whether it's fitness services or video services, anything, have increased prices over the last five years significantly other than music. That's probably the only industry that hasn't, other than the 10% price increases last year in the last few months. That's one. Two, that is not actually incentivized in the current agreements. It's actually the opposite. And two, it values every single piece of content exactly the same. And that is not how the world works, that is not how media works, that is not how sports works and not how anything works. So those things will change. What you're getting at is the user proposition, which also requires changes in our relationship with the DSPs and open to that - open to exploring that as well so that there can be yet additional model to audience segment and figure out a way to provide yet additional option to users that is driving increased ARPU versus another segment of our industry - of our revenue streams.\nRich Greenfield: Thanks very much.\nRobert Kyncl: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nStephen Laszczyk: Hi, thanks, good morning. For Robert or maybe Eric, it sounds like international is one of the more attractive areas for you to invest capital at the moment. I'd be curious if you could update us on your view on the return profile of investments in international markets compared to some of the other areas where you could perhaps invest capital today. And then looking ahead, how much capital you think you can manageably invest in international markets over the next few years. Any thoughts there would be great.\nRobert Kyncl: Hi, Stephen. So we continue to focus on multiple ways to invest in the globalization of our business. Obviously, our A&R marketing spend continue to help drive local music in markets around the world. We also have looked and done selective M&A acquisitions and investments in key markets around the world, especially in emerging markets, that help us build market share in markets that are fast-growing and as I like to say, kind of coming online and coming of age with streaming. And so whether that's Investing in Rotana, or acquiring Qanawat in the Mideast, which has given us significant market share growth in the Mideast in the neighborhood of 20%; or Africori, which we acquired last year in the fast-growing African market, which is I think the fastest growing in the world. So we continue to look at the globalization and specifically, emerging markets, as a way to supplement the development and growth and expansion of our market share in fast-growing markets around the world that have the opportunity for strong IRRs. So as far as our return on capital, we look at them similar to how we look at any other deal. Obviously, we look at double-digit returns as our threshold. We do look at the risk of deals and the likelihood of them paying off and making sure that we have a strong return profile. Overall, the company has a high-teens - consistent delivery of high-teens return on invested capital. So we keep that in mind as well, but the investments that we make are supportive of our ROIC. How much we invest I would say is somewhat opportunistic. We do not have a specific pool of capital to deploy in the globalization of our business. Specifically, through M&A, we are looking at kind of markets we see as high-growth and we look at the kind of build versus buy tradeoffs. And in some markets, we build organically. In some markets, we see acquisition opportunities which can accelerate the development of market share require upfront capital, but the deal has to be right. The management team that would usually, the vast majority of times, want to stay with the business and help build out our business has to be a good fit for our company and want to stay and be part of the Warner Music Group. So it really is flexible to what the structure is, but we're very focused on developing emerging markets and have done so and will continue to do so going forward, which supplements our growth and help increase the reach and diversification of the business. Thanks, Stephen.\nStephen Laszczyk: Great, thanks for that. And maybe just a second one on free cash flow conversion. Eric, it looked like it was pressured in the quarter by some one-time items. Could you help perhaps unpack some of those? And as you look out over the next year or so, I know on the call you mentioned the 50% to 60% cash conversion as being the multi-year target, is that within your scope this year or should we be thinking about that as more like your Q3-type target to achieve? Thank you.\nEric Levin: So what I would say is that - so there's two pieces. So fiscal calendar Q2 has traditionally been a wider cash conversion quarter. There's several reasons for that. One is it's the quarter that we pay bonuses, our DSP advances, which based on the timing of deals could happen at different times throughout the year but have not - traditionally, or certainly for quite some time, have been focused on fiscal Q2, have generally been more focused towards fiscal Q4. So some of the things that drive working capital opportunities, plus bonuses make fiscal Q2 generally a lighter quarter. So happens in this quarter, we had some additional tax payments. That's largely timing, but that did affect this quarter as well. What I would say is that we're roughly in line with where our cash conversion was through the second quarter of '22. And last year, we, for the full year, had an over 60% cash conversion rate. I'm not saying that's going to happen this year. I'm saying there's a lot of things that are in-flight, timing of deals that are being negotiated which could have cash advances that may or may not close in '23 or might fall into '24. Depending on the timing of those deals, we could meet our cash conversion targets very strongly in fiscal '23. If some of those deals fall into '24, then the delivery of the 50% to 60% could be over multiple - over '23, '24. So we continue to say over a multi-year timeframe because the timing of some of the deals isn't fixed in stone and we need that flexibility. But on a sustainable basis, that 50% to 60% is our target on a running basis, and we continue to focus on and are confident we can deliver.\nStephen Laszczyk: Great, thanks, Eric.\nEric Levin: Thanks, Stephen.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Thornton with Truist Securities. Your line is now open.\nMatthew Thornton: Hi, good morning, Robert. Good morning, Eric. Maybe two if I could. First one on emerging streaming. Eric, I apologize if I missed that, but was there any change in that revenue run rate? And I guess just higher level without getting into any specifics, I guess do you feel like you guys are making progress on the emerging side towards getting some more renewals closed later this year? And any just progress on that front would be helpful. Second question is really around margins. Eric, I think previously you talked about 50 basis points to 100 basis points OIBDA margin expansion this year. I think the long-term bogie over any multi-year period was roughly 100 basis points per year. Is that the right way to think about the business? Any color there would be helpful as well. Thanks, guys.\nRobert Kyncl: I'll take the first one on the renewals. So on the sort of emerging platforms renewals, my focus on - so, A, no update, but B, I have one rule that I focus on, which is if traffic moves from one platform to another, I want us to feel neutral about that. I don't want to trade dollars for pennies going one way or another. So that is really - that is what I'm looking for. And I think that's the fiscally responsible thing to do for the long-term health of the business. So that's all I can say as an update on that and so that you understand where our bottom line is. And I'll let Eric answer the second question.\nEric Levin: Yes. So, Matthew, no change on our margin outlook. We are continuing to focus on margin growth and each of the first two quarters of this year, we've delivered very strong margin growth, and we'll continue to look at the full year and every year going forward for margin growth. I will say that as Robert and the technology team and the business overall look at the technology initiatives and its ability to drive efficiency and scale in our business and specific executions within operating plans developed, we will fine-tune our financial plan with that, and we expect margin to continue to be a focus once we have that plan tweaked to some of our perspective on margin. It might, but I expect our margin focus to continue to be positive and our outlook and focus continue to focus on margin improvements going forward. But right now, we continue to focus on the 100 basis points a year. And specifically, this year I'd said - I've said 50 basis points to 100 basis points, given some of the dynamics, might be more realistic, but given the first half of the year, margin improvements have been actually quite strong.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Tim Nollen with Macquarie. Your line is now open.\nTim Nollen: Great, thanks for fitting me in. I've got couple of questions related to AI, very interesting topic both maybe offensively and defensively for you, Robert. You mentioned some of the copyright issues and it sounds like you're quite confident about your ability to defend against those. Is this going to be a running topic for some time or do you think the legislation that you referred to might begin to help? And then secondly, more sort of offensively for you, you mentioned using AI both for creating efficiencies but also, I think, implying that you could use AI more for your artists' creation of music. Are you looking to be building sort of proprietary AI that your artists can use as supposed to maybe using other services, or maybe anything else you can give us in terms of what you can be using AI for productively? Thanks.\nRobert Kyncl: Sure, thank you. So, one, yes, this will likely be a topic that will be ongoing, and we'll probably be talking about it for the next five years all the time. So until we all get tired of it. But yes, because it's a transformative technology. And yes, I look at both the threats as well as the opportunities, and probably look at the opportunities even more so than the threats. However, as somebody who is working with dozens of artists, has a historic catalog, obviously we have to look at protection of copyright name and likeness and voice, et cetera. And so again, this goes back to my parallel processing. This company is parallel processing. And for us and AI, it means both defensive and offensive at the same time. And I think the - there are a couple of things on this. Number one, regulation is important. I think, including people who are creating AI - generative AI, they agree on that, lots of good actors in that area. That is important. And copyright protection as part of that is very, very important. The second part next to it is the actual detection and enforcement, which is - because you can have regulation, but if you don't have detection and enforcement of that, then it's less useful to have the regulation. So we're in discussions with partners who have - who operate generative AI to figure that out, who operate platforms to figure that out. We obviously have lots of expertise on this front in-house with Ariel having overseen content ID on YouTube. And so that's an important part of it. And then the - sort of the use of AI for sort of offensive purposes, there is a very, very wide spectrum of things that it could be used for. I don't really want to go into the specifics of that because it's early, but what I can tell you is that we're running fast exploring all of that. And yes, we are in the business of and creating tools for artists to do their work - to have tools that basically supercharge their work, right? So I'm not looking at technologies only being a force multiplier for our teams and for Warner Music Group, but also for our roster. And so parallel processing on all of these fronts, and I think it's an exciting time for a company like ours and to be part of this and to be able to figure it all out and do it together with all of our technology and distribution partners.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to hand the conference back over to Robert Kyncl for closing remarks.\nRobert Kyncl: All right, so thank you all so much for your care, interest and all your questions, and I look forward to talking to you in 90 days. Thank you. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Robert Kyncl",
            "content": "Thanks, Kareem. And good morning, everyone. It's been four months since I joined Warner Music Group from Google, and I'd like to talk today about some changes we've made so far and shed some light on what's to come. But first, let me give you a summary of our Q2 results. As expected, on our last earnings call, some of the macroeconomic, currency and release slate headwinds from Q1 carried over into Q2. As a result, total revenue grew 5% and adjusted OIBDA increased 8%. Recorded Music revenue increased 3% and Streaming grew 2%, reflecting ongoing weakness in the ad market and modest growth in the United States. Music Publishing had another impressive quarter with revenue growth of 15%. Our strategy at Warner Chappell continues to deliver long-lasting relationships with a wide array of global and local talent, while expanding our services to songwriters and creating new opportunities for catalog. This quarter, highlights included our creative partnership with Belgian superstar, Stromae max contributions as a co-producer of Bad Bunny's latest album, and 21 Savage's collaboration with Drake on the number-one album, Her Loss. I promised I would be direct with you, so I'll simply say that while our results in Music Publishing were best-in-class, we underperformed in Recorded Music. There's plenty of room for improvement and we're addressing both company-specific and industry-wide issues. As we signaled, we have had two consecutive quarters where our release schedule was less robust than normal. That is now changing with the slate we have planned for the remainder of 2023. The early results are promising with new releases from the likes of Ed Sheeran, Jack Harlow, and Tiesto. I'll give some more details later on. While we are optimistic that our second half release slate will drive better results in the second half, this recovery may be gradual during the balance of the year. Overall, we're confident in our ability to return to a better cadence of releases, which should lead to more consistent results. At the same time, the music industry continues to morph, creating some risks and even more opportunities. This includes questions around the future of the streaming model and the rise of AI. It only increases our conviction in the tech-enabled strategies that will differentiate Warner Music Group. On our last earnings call, I said that we would be reallocating resources to accelerate our use of technology to empower artists and songwriters, as well as drive greater impact and efficiency in our business. In March, we made some tough but necessary decisions. We announced an approximately 4% reduction in our workforce that will yield annual savings of $49 million. We'll see approximately $20 million of savings in the remainder of this fiscal year. I want to be clear that this was not straightforward cost-cutting. We'll be reinvesting a significant portion of these savings into new expertise and tech initiatives that will drive company-wide benefits in the coming years. I want to frame for you how we're going to position Warner Music Group for long-term success in a highly proactive, fiscally responsible way. The demand for music is ubiquitous, and as the use cases multiply, the opportunities on the horizon are bigger and more wide-ranging than ever. Many of the key ingredients for our long-term success are already in place. We have incredible artists and songwriters and one-of-a-kind Cadillac of iconic music. We have the expertise, resources and reach to both artist careers and brands. But having said that, I don't underestimate our challenges either. The pace of change is faster, the competition for talent is fiercer, the world is growing noisier and attention spans are getting shorter. If we are to maximize our opportunities and solve our challenges, we need to add great technology into our mix. And it can be tools we borrow from someone else, it's got to be proprietary, central part of our value proposition. Technology can be our force multiplier, a force multiplier for the skills and the capabilities of our team in service of our artists, songwriters and our catalog. It's not going to happen overnight, but long term, we're looking at music and technology as the twin engines of our success. I'd like to tell you a bit more about our plan, starting as always with the music. Today, the majority of the music industry's revenues come from a relatively small fraction of the world's population. That makes growth potential in emerging markets enormous. This March, IFPI released a list of fastest-growing recorded music markets. I was pleased to note that we've been expanding our presence in these regions for years by appointing new leadership, opening additional offices and partnering with influential local players. The recorded music industry's fastest-growing region in 2022 was Sub-Saharan Africa, jumping 35%. It's an area that's full of incredibly diverse, dynamic music cultures and we've been steadily ramping up our A&R activities there for the past five years. Key moves have including acquiring Africa's leading independent distributor, Africori, at the start of last year. We now contend for market leadership, driven by the success of artists like CKay, Burna Boy, Master KG and Inkabi Zezwe as well. The next three fastest-growing regions for the recorded music industry in 2022 were China, up 28%; MENA, up 24%; and Latin America, up 26%. In both China and MENA, our revenue growth outperformed the market in Q2. And in Latin America, we're taking the necessary steps to catch up and gain share. We have a great story to tell about how we're enhancing our profile in each of these key regions. In China, Warner Music Group has led the way as far back as 2014 by acquiring the Gold Typhoon catalog and by being the first major music company to partner with Tencent. In MENA, we established our regional office over five years ago and we've since leapfrogged our competitors through deals with Rotana and Qanawat. In Latin America, we've rejuvenated our A&R strategy. Our breakout artists include Mexico's Yng Lvcas, who is currently number three on global Spotify chart. We're also looking to expand our presence in fast-growing genres. This April, the Annual Report for the International Music Summit reveals that the dance music industry generated revenue of $11.3 billion in 2022, an increase of 34% from 2021. We're fully primed to capitalize on this trend. Since 2017, we've acquired Spinnin' Records, launched new labels, including Major Recordings in the US, and Whet Records in Asia, and partnered with dance music legend, Patrick Moxey. In 2021, we acquired the catalog of French superstar DJ producer, David Guetta, and signed a new deal with him for future recordings. Amazingly, David, who released his first album in 2002, was the most streamed dance artist in 2021, 2022 and so far in 2023. On technology, we're still evolving our plan, but let me share a glimpse into my vision. As the music industry transitions from physical to digital, it continues to focus on high-touch areas it's always been good at and underinvested in its tech capabilities. These are the capabilities we're forging here under the guidance of Ariel Bardin, our new President of Technology. We're building the leadership, the team and the culture that will bring an unprecedented level of tech expertise to the music business. As we look ahead, here is what you should expect us to do. Number one, create efficiency by enhancing our systems and decision making so we free up resources for higher ROI opportunities. Number two, increase our effectiveness as brand managers for our artists and songwriters. Number three, grow scale through services for greater range and number of artists and songwriters all on one tech stack. And number four, evolving our products to better monetize the artists' and songwriters' superfan relationship. Switching to monetization. As I've said before, music is undervalued. This is something we intend to change in order to create a healthier ecosystem for artists, songwriters, the streaming services, and us. Recent price increases have been successful and are a move in the right direction, but they should be just the first step. Those subscription services which have raised prices have done the fiscally prudent thing for themselves, their shareholders and the creative community. There is no sign that they are seeing elevated churn. At the same time, WMG has started to experiment with different streaming models. I cannot name all these services as the deal terms are confidential, but this is just the beginning, and we will continue to collaborate with our partners on new paradigms. When it comes to generative AI, it needs to be put into proper context. Framing it only as a threat is inaccurate. Our first priority is to vigorously enforce our copyrights and our rights to name, image, likeness and voice to defend the originality of our artists and songwriters. It is crucial that any AI-generative platform discloses what their AI is trained on, and this must happen all around the world. Europe is leading by example with the EU Artificial Intelligence Act. The European Parliament is considering amendments which would codify the position that copyrighted content may not be used to train AI without prior authorization from rights-holders and would require AI developers to disclose a summary of the materials they used to train AI. As in Europe, all around the world lawmakers are debating AI, but the primary focus has been issues such as transparency, safety, algorithmic bias, privacy protection, notice to consumers and an ability to opt-out. Last month, Senator Chuck Schumer announced his intention to drive the US AI bill coming later this year. I can promise you that whenever and wherever there is a legislative initiative on AI, we will be there in force to ensure the protection of intellectual property is high on the agenda. However, we must also see and seize the massive opportunity that generative AI will also be. Consider this, user-generated content containing copyrighted material was originally viewed as a big threat by media companies. From my personal experience at YouTube when I arrived in 2010, we were fighting many lawsuits around the world and were generating low tens of millions of dollars from UGC. We turned that liability into a billion-dollar opportunity in just a handful of years and the multiple in dollar revenue stream over time. In 2022, YouTube announced that it paid out over $2 billion from UGC to music rights-holders alone and far more across all other content industries. AI is just like any emerging technology, there will be challenges and opportunities. And with the proper expertise, it will be a powerful tool for the music industry, and we intend to be there at the forefront on how to best deploy it. Before I hand it over to Eric, I wanted to say that our strong second half slate has begun to take shape. On Friday, immediately following a victorious outcome in the baseless copyright infringement case lodged against him, Ed Sheeran dropped his acclaimed new album, Subtract. The first single, Eyes Closed, which you may have heard on our pre-call hold music, became Ed's 14th number one single in the UK. The album has already hit number one in 41 countries on iTunes, while physical preorders have outstripped the numbers for Ed's last album in multiple territories. We're seeing encouraging signs from other recent releases. Rap superstar Jack Harlow surprise-dropped a new album on April 28 and it's already racked up over 70 million streams. While Tiesto released his new album on April 21 and quickly went Double Platinum in Brazil and Norway. FIFTY FIFTY's Cupid, and Yng Lvcas's La Bebe Remix, have been two of the hardest streaming singles. Our releases from across the globe occupy four of the top 10 spots on the Spotify Top 50 USA Chart, with all four coming from outside the US, highlighting how we're bringing local artists to a global stage. Additionally, we have new music from Dua Lipa, David Guetta, Lil Uzi Vert, Burna Boy, Kelly Clarkson, Tiago PZK, and Bailey Zimmerman, and many more in the months to come. I'm very confident in the path forward as we combine creative and marketing excellence with tech innovation to propel our growth. Finally, in March, Eric announced that he will retire by the end of the calendar year. We started the process of searching for his successor, but we're fortunate that he will be with us for a while longer. I'll give you an update on the search in the coming months. For now, I will turn it over to Eric to take you through our results and then will answer your questions. Thanks, Michael. So on the first part of your question, there's no real update that I can provide you because those discussions are private, obviously. And when there is some update, I will make sure to share that. But what I can tell you is this, which is, one, I'm excited that they're sounding constructive publicly about the price increases on their earnings call. But more importantly, actually I think it was you who published a report that the price increase would result in EUR1 billion uplift in annual revenue for Spotify in 2024, which obviously is quite positive and accretive. So clearly there will be a win-win, not just for Spotify and us, but also for every DSP if price increases happen. That's really - that's all I have to say about that at this point. Thank you. Well, thanks. So on a technology front, I think in my opening remarks I highlighted the four areas that technology will impact Warner. 100% focused on efficiency. There is a lot that we can achieve using technology on that front. 100% focused on effectiveness of all of our activities, scale and then focus on monetization of superfans. It is - every area of our business that I look at can use technology as a force multiplier. So what we're doing is, A, we've recruited the initial team of just A-list technologists which are unprecedented in this music industry. And we're having an incredible momentum with hiring more and more people of that type that want to come here and be part of what we're doing. And at the same time, we're looking at all the activities inside the company, all the projects, and see how we apply them against the four areas that I was talking about. I think this is incredibly exciting, and I like to say is that we have to constantly parallel process on everything. This is the greatest example. We're parallel processing in four different areas with technology. And what's even more encouraging is that the music part of the company is embracing it in the most welcoming sense because everyone sees what a force multiplier this can be on all of our activities that we do developing artists and marketing artists and songwriters. So it's an exciting journey to be part of. And I can't underscore enough how unprecedented this is, but obviously time will - we will have to prove it through our products that we ship and our actual deliveries. I prefer actions speaking louder than words. So I look forward to, at some point in the future, be actually prove that, but I'm incredibly confident about this. Your second question on majors and sort of non-Western markets. So I'm just about four months in on this, so I'll reserve any sort of absolute statements on these things because there's still a lot to unpack. What I can tell you is that music is far more global than it's ever been. And what I mean by that is that it comes from everywhere. The rise of local music in markets all around the world is undeniable. I've seen it from my seat at YouTube for many years. I'm glad that Warner has been investing over the past many years. And alongside this strategy, I highlighted some of that in my opening remarks, the Middle East and other - and China and other markets. And I think it's an incredibly exciting time for music because of that. As it relates to - so we're leaned into it. Obviously, I'm very, very focused on making sure that we succeed all around the world, not just with distribution, but with sourcing of content, discover new talent and helping them become global stars and global superstars. On majors versus indies, I think I touched on this on the last earnings call. Obviously, as there is more and more music being uploaded, that can put some pressure on us, but all the same tools that everyone has at their disposal are the tools that we have at our disposal. So I would not go to any foregone conclusion on long-term market share loss on that. All right, I'll throw it to Eric. I think he is better suited to answer here. Go ahead, Eric. Yes, so on the DSP model. So I think I've said publicly a few times that I am convinced, and various numbers back up, that music is significantly undervalued. For instance, relative to streaming video, roughly $0.50 on a $1 by multiple different analyses or versus inflation, et cetera. So it is undervalued. When I look at that, I start thinking about like what are the underlying causes of that. And a great example of that is my own work at YouTube, where over the course of five years, we have increased the price of YouTube TV subscription by 100% and we have not increased the price of YouTube Music by any percent. Same people, two completely different decisions, two completely different outcomes. And by the way, both businesses grew very successfully. And the cause of that is the structure of the agreements with DSPs. That structure was really, really good for the industry. It has taken it from a low point to an incredible recurring revenue stream all around the world with massive amounts of people and have payment instruments on file, premium experience, personalization, all of that, and then has rebuilt the business. But it does not mean that it is the right thing for the next 10 or 20 years. It has to change, and it will change. One of the reasons for that is that there is not a real incentive for price increases that you see in every other industry. But the other is that every stream is valued exactly the same way. And that doesn't seem like something that's aligned with the way the world works. For instance, in sports, LeBron James earns more money than some of his teammates, not because he plays more hours per day. Plays exactly the same number of hours, but yet he earns more. ESPN commands more money per subscriber per month than any other TV channel, not because it's consumed more. There is propensity to pay, there is users' willingness to remain with the overall services, et cetera. So it can be that Ed Sheeran's stream is worth exactly the same thing than a stream of rain falling on the roof. I think you're catching my drift, kind of where I'm going. I think we have a misaligned model at this point. Now that the industry has - is healthy and has grown incredibly well, I think it's time to re-evaluate how we're licensing to DSPs, do it together with them because these - there are ways to make all of this win-win. But music cannot be the only industry that doesn't assign value to high-value artists and songwriters, that it doesn't drive ARPU growth the way every other industry does. So I'm not trying to limit the volume of content. I understand that's important for personalization and choice. I'm looking to change the value equation, the way it works today, and put in new incentives. But it's too early to talk about any other specifics, but you can imagine it is one of the top priorities for me personally to change. Yes, we can. Yes, so I think there are two different things. One is sort of the user experience and the value proposition, which is, I think, more what you were touching on. And then there is the sort of wholesale relationship between us and the DSPs. So what I was talking about previously was the change of the wholesale relationship which is necessary going forward. But I do think that evolution of the - well, let's say the retailer relationship between the DSPs and the users is always open. And I think dual revenue stream models are great. I think you always need a premium version as well. Obviously, we've experimented with all of that at YouTube. I do think the experimentation with paid models that have ads in it is also important, right? Obviously, we've seen that with Hulu successfully as their most adopted tier despite having the completely ad-free option. So I think I think innovation around the use cases for users is important because it basically helps optimize audience segmentation, right, along different price points and different ARPUs. And we're 100% open to exploring all of these things with our partners. But what I'm trying to stress is that the status quo of the way things work right now is not something that's going to work going forward. And I think - yes, go ahead. Yes and no. One, even if nothing changed on the user proposition, the wholesale relationship has to change because today, it does not increase - does not incentivize price increases. And as you've seen in every single subscription service, whether it's fitness services or video services, anything, have increased prices over the last five years significantly other than music. That's probably the only industry that hasn't, other than the 10% price increases last year in the last few months. That's one. Two, that is not actually incentivized in the current agreements. It's actually the opposite. And two, it values every single piece of content exactly the same. And that is not how the world works, that is not how media works, that is not how sports works and not how anything works. So those things will change. What you're getting at is the user proposition, which also requires changes in our relationship with the DSPs and open to that - open to exploring that as well so that there can be yet additional model to audience segment and figure out a way to provide yet additional option to users that is driving increased ARPU versus another segment of our industry - of our revenue streams. Thanks. Hi, Stephen. So we continue to focus on multiple ways to invest in the globalization of our business. Obviously, our A&R marketing spend continue to help drive local music in markets around the world. We also have looked and done selective M&A acquisitions and investments in key markets around the world, especially in emerging markets, that help us build market share in markets that are fast-growing and as I like to say, kind of coming online and coming of age with streaming. And so whether that's Investing in Rotana, or acquiring Qanawat in the Mideast, which has given us significant market share growth in the Mideast in the neighborhood of 20%; or Africori, which we acquired last year in the fast-growing African market, which is I think the fastest growing in the world. So we continue to look at the globalization and specifically, emerging markets, as a way to supplement the development and growth and expansion of our market share in fast-growing markets around the world that have the opportunity for strong IRRs. So as far as our return on capital, we look at them similar to how we look at any other deal. Obviously, we look at double-digit returns as our threshold. We do look at the risk of deals and the likelihood of them paying off and making sure that we have a strong return profile. Overall, the company has a high-teens - consistent delivery of high-teens return on invested capital. So we keep that in mind as well, but the investments that we make are supportive of our ROIC. How much we invest I would say is somewhat opportunistic. We do not have a specific pool of capital to deploy in the globalization of our business. Specifically, through M&A, we are looking at kind of markets we see as high-growth and we look at the kind of build versus buy tradeoffs. And in some markets, we build organically. In some markets, we see acquisition opportunities which can accelerate the development of market share require upfront capital, but the deal has to be right. The management team that would usually, the vast majority of times, want to stay with the business and help build out our business has to be a good fit for our company and want to stay and be part of the Warner Music Group. So it really is flexible to what the structure is, but we're very focused on developing emerging markets and have done so and will continue to do so going forward, which supplements our growth and help increase the reach and diversification of the business. Thanks, Stephen. I'll take the first one on the renewals. So on the sort of emerging platforms renewals, my focus on - so, A, no update, but B, I have one rule that I focus on, which is if traffic moves from one platform to another, I want us to feel neutral about that. I don't want to trade dollars for pennies going one way or another. So that is really - that is what I'm looking for. And I think that's the fiscally responsible thing to do for the long-term health of the business. So that's all I can say as an update on that and so that you understand where our bottom line is. And I'll let Eric answer the second question. Sure, thank you. So, one, yes, this will likely be a topic that will be ongoing, and we'll probably be talking about it for the next five years all the time. So until we all get tired of it. But yes, because it's a transformative technology. And yes, I look at both the threats as well as the opportunities, and probably look at the opportunities even more so than the threats. However, as somebody who is working with dozens of artists, has a historic catalog, obviously we have to look at protection of copyright name and likeness and voice, et cetera. And so again, this goes back to my parallel processing. This company is parallel processing. And for us and AI, it means both defensive and offensive at the same time.

And copyright protection as part of that is very, very important.

So we're in discussions with partners who have - who operate generative AI to figure that out, who operate platforms to figure that out. We obviously have lots of expertise on this front in-house with Ariel having overseen content ID on YouTube. And so that's an important part of it. And then the - sort of the use of AI for sort of offensive purposes, there is a very, very wide spectrum of things that it could be used for. I don't really want to go into the specifics of that because it's early, but what I can tell you is that we're running fast exploring all of that.

All right, so thank you all so much for your care, interest and all your questions, and I look forward to talking to you in 90 days. Thank you. Have a great day."

            "content": "Thank you, Robert. And good morning, everyone. Despite the challenges Robert cited, we delivered growth in revenue, adjusted OIBDA and adjusted OIBDA margin. Total revenue increased 4.6%, reflecting growth in both Recorded Music and Music Publishing. Adjusted OIBDA increased 7.9% with margin of 20.4% compared to 19.8% in the prior-year quarter. These increases were primarily due to higher revenue and lower variable marketing spend which is linked to the timing of releases. Recorded Music revenue grew 2.5%. Streaming revenue increased 2.2% as subscription streaming grew in the mid-single-digits and was partially offset by ad-supported revenue declining in the mid-teens. Our streaming results reflect a lighter release schedule and market-related slowdown in ad-supported revenue. Physical revenue increased 1%, driven by solid performance in the US. Artist services and expanded rights revenue decreased by 4% due to lower merchandising and advertising revenue, partially offset by higher concert promotion revenue. Licensing revenue increased 27%, including growth in brand income and the licensing settlement. Recorded Music adjusted OIBDA increased by 2% with a margin of 21.8%, which was roughly flat compared to the prior-year quarter. Music Publishing continues to deliver impressive results, posting 15% revenue growth, driven by strength in digital, performance and mechanical. Digital revenue grew 18%, the same for streaming revenue, driven by continued growth in streaming and the impact of digital deal renewals. Performance revenue increased by 29% primarily due to the timing of payments from collection societies and the remaining recovery from COVID disruption. Performance revenue is now fully recovered from COVID, and we expect the growth to moderate meaningfully starting next quarter. Mechanical revenue increased 23% primarily due to a strong share in physical sales, and sync decreased by 4% due to lower commercial licensing activity in the US, partially offset by copyright infringement settlements. Music Publishing adjusted OIBDA increased 25% to $76 million, with margin increasing 240 basis points to 29.6%, driven by strong operating performance. In March, we announced an approximately 4% reduction in headcount that will generate annual savings of $49 million starting in fiscal '24. We expect to realize $20 million of these savings in fiscal '23. In connection with these headcount reductions, there were non-recurring restructuring charges in the quarter of $41 million for severance costs. The cash outflows related to these costs will occur through the end of fiscal 2024. In April, we successfully launched certain components of our financial transformation program in select territories. The program remains on track to meaningfully rollout in a wave-based approach throughout the globe and with expanded functionalities during fiscal '23 and '24, yielding expected annualized run-rate savings of $35 million to $40 million once fully implemented. Q2 CapEx increased to $35 million as compared to $28 million in the prior-year quarter, mainly due to investments in IT capabilities. Operating and free cash flow were both a use of cash in Q2. Operating cash flow decreased to a use of $6 million from a source of $44 million in the prior-year quarter because of higher income and withholding tax payments primarily due to higher estimated US taxable income, the utilization of certain remaining tax credits in the prior-year quarter and other movements in working capital. Free cash flow decreased to a use of $41 million from $16 million in the prior-year quarter. As a reminder, our working capital will fluctuate from quarter to quarter, but our goal remains to deliver an operating cash flow conversion ratio of 50% to 60% over a multi-year period. As of March, we had a cash balance of $601 million, total debt of $4 billion, and net debt of $3.4 billion. Our weighted average cost of debt is 4% and our nearest maturity date is in 2028. We expect growth to reaccelerate in the back half of the fiscal year, driven by our robust release schedule. In Q3, we've already had successful releases from Ed Sheeran, Jack Harlow, and Tiesto. We look forward to more releases from some of our biggest stars and our next generation of talent from across the globe as we progress through the remainder of the fiscal year. We continue to position ourselves for long-term success, and we're reallocating resources to ensure we evolve our business in a fast, smart and accretive way. Thank you to everyone for joining us today. We'll now open the call for questions. So thanks, Robert. And good to talk to you, Michael. So on the kind of release slate and first half versus second half and the impact, I think we feel - as we've said and signaled before, our release slate was a little lighter in the first two quarters of the year and will be quite weighted towards Q3 and Q4. As we said on the call, we already have some releases out of Q3, Sheeran, Jack Harlow, Tiesto, that are already showing strong results with a lot more to come. We have the Barbie soundtrack featuring Dua Lipa, which we're excited about Tebi Rex and music, David Guetta, Charlie Puth. Yng Lvcas out of Mexico is the top three Spotify hit. We can keep going and going. The point is that the releases are there, and the second half is looking quite strong. We absolutely expect this to improve our results in Recorded Music streaming in the second half of the year, and this would likely create uplift in both streaming and physical. Those two categories are the ones that would be most positively affected, Michael. Sure. Thank you. Thanks. So hi, Sebastiano. Great to talk to you again. And on CapEx, I would say a few things. So we are absolutely, kind of with Robert and the tech team, developing, we'll call it the updated plan that shows increased investment in tech and tech capabilities to drive the business forward. So as our financial transformation starts to wind down and costs come down, I would reasonably expect that our tech investment and CapEx costs are higher than they were historically. So whether that yields to something that stays relatively flat, but I would expect it to be $100 million or more of the exact numbers over a long-term plan, will come out as we finalize our strategic plan and the financial plans that goes with it, which are still in-flight with Robert, and Ariel, and the new team still developing the plans forward. So I think more to come, but certainly there will be increased investment in technology. That said, some of the cost measures that we've taken, specifically the headcount reductions, which are going to generate $49 million of savings in fiscal '24 and annually thereafter, our objective is for the technology costs to basically be funded by other cost-savings measures. So it's not incremental cost to the business. It is just a reallocation of resources to where it could have more impact and drive growth and efficiency in the business. So the plan and details are in-flight, but the strategy is clear and already taking place. On OIBDA growth, Sebastiano, I think it's fair, as you look at the business, to say that our first half ago fiscal year had a lighter release schedule, which meant that it was very imperative for us to be managing costs very tightly and prudently, looking at every single line of the business, whether it's overhead, marketing, to make sure the cost being spent and what was deployed was having impact in the market. And because of that, we managed our margins and our OIBDA growth and EBITDA growth quite carefully and we're able to deliver solid bottom-line growth. And obviously, we'll continue to manage the business with financial discipline. But as we look at the second half of the year and a deployment in the market of a significant amount of high-end music, you should expect us to support that with marketing appropriately to continue to make sure we're driving the impact in growth in the business. But we'll continue to look at all cost lines to make sure we're driving opportunity for OIBDA growth, and we continue to focus on driving the business for margin growth over a sustainable period of time. That said, if we look at specific business lines on. Recorded Music, I would look at opportunities to improve streaming growth in the second half of the year. I think sync, which has been affected by the ad market downturn and the production of commercials, we'll be looking carefully to see how the economy responds and how ad markets and commercial production responds. And we'll be very close to that market. And if there's an opportunity to reaccelerate that growth like we did in '22, we'll be pushing that pedal hard. As we look at the publishing side of the business. Warner Chappell has continued really solid teens growth, and we expect Warner Chappell to continue very strong growth. I would say, on Warner Chappell, two things. One is that the performance line, which has had outsized growth, because its recovery from COVID has taken multiple years is about at the end of its recovery line, is about where it was pre-COVID. And we still expect that to be a growth area, but at a slower pace. But digital, specifically driven by big streaming market growth, we continue to expect to see which - and streaming is now our largest revenue line by far in Warner Chappell. We expect that to continue its strong growth trends going forward, driving the market and the effective strategies of the Chappell management team, which have been outpacing market growth in streaming. So we see a strong growth profile going forward for Warner Chappell and opportunity for acceleration of key lines on Recorded. Thanks, Sebastiano. Yes. And I'm happy to take the advertising ones. So, Ben, on that one, I guess I would say we're seeing some positive signs, but I would continue to be cautious. I think in calendar Q1, we saw YouTube and Meta have some improved results. I think as we've talked about our stronger release schedule in the second half of the year gives us optimism that advertising has the opportunity to do better in Q3. We will start to have easier comps, as in Q3 of '22 was when the market started to soften and then in Q4 '22 is when it softened significantly. And so we are more optimistic going forward, but I would also say that in prior quarters, we've seen a stronger month or two and then a month that has been much weaker within a quarter. So I think we want to see a pattern of improvement before we really believe that the market has stabilized, but there are some signs of improvement out there. And with our stronger release schedule and easier comps, I think we feel much better about the second half of the year than the results from the first half of the year on advertising. So what I would say is that - so there's two pieces. So fiscal calendar Q2 has traditionally been a wider cash conversion quarter. There's several reasons for that. One is it's the quarter that we pay bonuses, our DSP advances, which based on the timing of deals could happen at different times throughout the year but have not - traditionally, or certainly for quite some time, have been focused on fiscal Q2, have generally been more focused towards fiscal Q4. So some of the things that drive working capital opportunities, plus bonuses make fiscal Q2 generally a lighter quarter. So happens in this quarter, we had some additional tax payments. That's largely timing, but that did affect this quarter as well. What I would say is that we're roughly in line with where our cash conversion was through the second quarter of '22. And last year, we, for the full year, had an over 60% cash conversion rate. I'm not saying that's going to happen this year. I'm saying there's a lot of things that are in-flight, timing of deals that are being negotiated which could have cash advances that may or may not close in '23 or might fall into '24. Depending on the timing of those deals, we could meet our cash conversion targets very strongly in fiscal '23. If some of those deals fall into '24, then the delivery of the 50% to 60% could be over multiple - over '23, '24. So we continue to say over a multi-year timeframe because the timing of some of the deals isn't fixed in stone and we need that flexibility. But on a sustainable basis, that 50% to 60% is our target on a running basis, and we continue to focus on and are confident we can deliver. Thanks, Stephen. Yes. So, Matthew, no change on our margin outlook. We are continuing to focus on margin growth and each of the first two quarters of this year, we've delivered very strong margin growth, and we'll continue to look at the full year and every year going forward for margin growth. I will say that as Robert and the technology team and the business overall look at the technology initiatives and its ability to drive efficiency and scale in our business and specific executions within operating plans developed, we will fine-tune our financial plan with that, and we expect margin to continue to be a focus once we have that plan tweaked to some of our perspective on margin. It might, but I expect our margin focus to continue to be positive and our outlook and focus continue to focus on margin improvements going forward. But right now, we continue to focus on the 100 basis points a year. And specifically, this year I'd said - I've said 50 basis points to 100 basis points, given some of the dynamics, might be more realistic, but given the first half of the year, margin improvements have been actually quite strong."

At the request of Warner Music Group, today's call is being recorded for replay purposes and if you object, you may disconnect at any time. Now I would like to turn today's call over to your host, Mr. Kareem Chin, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nKareem Chin: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Warner Music Group's fiscal first quarter earnings conference call. Please note that our earnings press release, earnings snapshot and the Form 10-Q we filed this morning will be available on our website. On today's call, we have our CEO, Robert Kyncl; and our CFO, Eric Levin, who will take you through our results and then we will answer your questions. Before our prepared remarks, I'd like to refer you to the second slide of the earning snapshot to remind you that this communication includes forward-looking statements that reflect the current views of Warner Music Group about future events and financial performance. We plan to present certain non-GAAP results during this conference call and in our earning snapshot slides and have provided schedules reconciling these results to our GAAP results in our earnings press release. All of these materials are posted on our website. Also, please note that all revenue figures and comparisons discussed today will be presented in constant-currency unless otherwise noted. All forward-looking statements are made as of today and we disclaim any duty to update such statements. Our expectations, beliefs and projections are expressed in good faith and we believe there is a reasonable basis for them. However, there can be no assurance that management's expectations, beliefs and projections will result or be achieved. Investors should not rely on forward-looking statements, because they are subject to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors that can cause actual results that differ materially from our expectations. Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in our filings with the SEC. And with that I will turn it over to Robert.\nRobert Kyncl: Thank you, Kareem, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be here speaking with all of you for my first earnings call at Warner Music Group. I've been on the job for five weeks and I'm grateful to our Board of Directors, and our employees, artists and songwriters for giving me such a warm welcome. I would especially like to thank my predecessor, Steve Cooper, for everything he has done to position the company for long-term success, and for all his insights as I've been getting up to speed. Thanks also to you, our valued shareholders and everyone who follows the company for your continued support. So let's get into Q1 results. I am committed to maintaining straightforward and consistent communication with the investor community. So in that spirit, I want to immediately and clearly acknowledge that this was a tough quarter. Like most companies, WMG has been dealing with macroeconomic headwinds and the impact of currency exchange rates. It's important to note that last year's Q1 included an extra week of reporting, as a result, this quarter's comparisons need to be adjusted to provide an accurate picture and I'll be discussing our results in that context. Eric will give you more detail, but here are the headlines. Total revenue in Q1 grew 2% and adjusted OIBDA increased 13%, with 210 basis points of margin improvement. Recorded Music revenue was flat as the strength of our global performance was offset by a softer quarter in the U.S. We had a tough comparison with the prior year quarter, which included releases from some of our superstar artists. We're expecting a stronger release schedule in the back-half of the fiscal year, which will feature new music from Ed Sheeran, Cardi B, David Guetta, Aya Nakamura and BeBe Rexha. Music Publishing had another strong quarter with revenue growth of 14%. Our operating cash-flow growth was healthy, despite some of our revenue lines coming under pressure. This further underscores our disciplined fiscal management, as we navigate this challenging business environment. I'd like to spend some time on this call, proactively addressing two questions that have often been asked. Specifically, why I chose to go into the Music business and why I joined the Warner Music Group after 12 years at YouTube and seven years at Netflix. YouTube drives the intersection of creators and technology, which means that I had many options to choose from in planning my next chapter. I chose Music first and foremost, because everyone loves music including me. It's embraced by 100% of global population. In an increasingly digital world, music makes people feel and it brings them joy, hope and comfort, plus in an increasingly divided world, music brings people together. That engagement is very powerful and valuable and we expect the evolution of monetization models to reflect that. On top of that, music's global appeal is matched by its ubiquity. This industry has achieved something rare. It's build mutually beneficial, long-term partnerships with many of the world's biggest companies, Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, Spotify and Tencent, among them. As successful as music has become, there is still meaningful upside ahead for three reasons. One, as technology opens up emerging economies, the industry's addressable market will continue to expand even further. Two, innovation is constantly creating new use cases for music, giving us the opportunity to diversify our revenue sources. Three, music is still undervalued, especially when compared to other forms of entertainment like video. I'd like to expand a bit on that last point. Since 2011, the subscription price of Netflix's standard service has roughly doubled. Data shows that almost 80% of U.S. households subscribed to at least three streaming video services. This means that the average household is spending more than four times per month on a combination of digital video services that isn't even a comprehensive offering. In contrast, the price of the music subscription has stayed the same since streaming was introduced over a decade ago. Most consumers subscribe to a single-service that carries virtually all the music ever released. Against this backdrop, it is encouraging that we're seeing first steps in the right direction by Apple, Deezer and Amazon. The other question I often get asked is why WMG? First and foremost, it's the artists and songwriters and powerful catalogs that are the lifeblood of this company and it's such a pleasure to bring this creative work depends around the world. The new generations of stars like Lizzo, Dua Lipa and Aya Nakamura; global superstars such as Ed Sheeran, Bruno Mars, Coldplay and Neil Young; songwriters and composers like Lin-Manuel Miranda, Gamble & Huff and John Williams; and legends such as John Coltrane, Led Zeppelin, Aretha Franklin and Prince. Second, it's the people at WMG. This company has a consistent decades-long history of finding and developing unique voices that change culture globally and then increasingly complex uncluttered world that originality is an essential ingredient of our success. Third is about size. WMG is big enough to drive meaningful change in the industry, but small enough to have plenty of room for growth. As just one example, the company has been taking thoughtful approach to global expansion. WMG has made world time moves that lead front the competition and dynamic fast-growing markets such as China and the Middle-East. This approach has also delivered record-breaking global first, with audits like Anita from Brazil, Paulo Londra from Argentina, King from India and CK from Nigeria. I wanted to briefly address what we're doing to architect the next phase of growth. I'm only five weeks in, but I've been very intentional about how we've gone about this. I made two significant appointments, both of which tell you something about our priorities going-forward. I hired Tim Matusch my former colleague at YouTube, as our new EVP of Strategy and Operations, which is a new role at WMG. Tim will be critical to facilitating our strategic vision and ensuring operational execution. I also hired Ariel Bardin, as our President of Technology. Ariel's career includes 16 years at Google, where he built, launched and let some of the company's most successful products, including YouTube's creator tools, memberships and content ID. He will drive the development of the systems, infrastructure and products needed to support our growth. As I've said, I'm committed to clear and straightforward communication on our progress. I also want you to know, I'm a big believer that actions speak louder than words and I'm laser-focused on execution. Right now, I'm working with leaders across the company to develop our plans for the future. We're already exploring some exciting ideas and initiatives and we will provide you with updates as soon as appropriate.  That said, many of the fundamentals will remain the same. The foundations of this company are very strong and the music industry is rich with opportunities. We will continue to invest in new artists and songwriters, our catalog and our global expansion. At the same time, we plan to thoughtfully reallocate some resources to accelerate how we use technology and data to empower artists and songwriters, as well as drive greater efficiency in our business. As subscription revenue continues to grow, as supported recovers and we explore the possibilities of new technologies and business models, it's essential we structure our deals smartly and strategically. I am approaching this next phase of growth with the unique benefits of having been on both sides of the table. I am proud that over the last five years at YouTube, we developed a very collaborative mutually beneficial relationship with the music industry, after years of rocky ones. I plan on bringing in the same approach to the WMG and the industry, so that our interests are aligned with our partners and that our artists and songwriters gain maximum participation and monetization. Now, I'll pass it over to Eric, who will take you through our results and then we'll answer your questions.\nEric Levin: Thank you, Robert and good morning, everyone. As Robert mentioned, our year-over-year comparisons should take into account the impact of the extra week in fiscal Q1, 2022. Adjusting for the extra week, we delivered growth across key metrics, including revenue, adjusted OIBDA and adjusted OIBDA margin. Additionally, we saw strong operating cash-flow growth and strong cash conversion as a percentage of adjusted OIBDA, despite a challenging macro-environment. Total revenue declined 2.7%, but increased 2% when adjusted for the impact of the extra week. Adjusted OIBDA was flat and increased 12.8% when adjusted for the extra week. Adjusted OIBDA margin was 22.5% compared to 21.9% in the prior year quarter. Adjusting for the extra week, margin increased 210 basis-points. These increases were primarily due to disciplined operating performance and the impact of currency exchange rates. Recorded Music revenue declined 5.6%, that was roughly flat when adjusting for the impact of the extra week. Streaming revenue decreased by 2.6%, after adjusting for the extra week Streaming revenue grew by 5%, as subscription streaming revenue grew by high-single-digits and was partially offset by ad-supported revenue declining in the mid-teens. Physical revenue declined 27%, adjusting for the extra week, Physical declined 22%. Our Streaming and Physical results reflect a lighter release schedule we had this quarter compared with the prior year period, which included releases from Ed Sheeran and Coldplay. Artist services and expanded rights revenue decreased by 4%, due to macro-economic pressures affecting our E&P business and lower advertising revenue. Licensing increased 17% due to an increase in broadcast fees, synchronization and other third-party licensing. Recorded music adjusted OIBDA decreased by 6% with margin of 24.1%, which was roughly flat compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of the extra week, adjusted OIBDA grew 7% and the margin improvement was approximately 150 basis-points. This was driven by disciplined operating performance and the favorable impact of currency exchange rates. Music Publishing continues to deliver strong results, posting 14% growth, driven by strength across digital, performance and mechanical. Digital revenue grew 16%, reflecting growth in streaming, which increased 17% driven by continued growth in streaming services and timing of new digital deals. Performance revenue increased by 29%, due to continued growth from bars, restaurants, concerts and live events. Mechanical revenue increased by 17%, due to growth in France and Sync revenue decreased by 5%, due to lower commercial licensing activity in the U.S. and the timing of legal settlements. Music Publishing adjusted OIBDA increased 36% to $72 million with margin increasing 460 basis points, driven by strong operating performance and the favorable impact of currency exchange rates. Q1 CapEx decreased to $21 million as compared to $34 million in the prior year quarter, mainly due to lower facilities investments. We anticipate some acceleration in the coming quarters, driven by IT infrastructure facilities and financial transformation investments. Our financial transformation program remains on-track to meaningfully rollout in fiscal 2024 and expand globally in the following years. The program is expected to deliver annualized run rate savings of $35 million to $40 million once fully implemented. Operating and free-cash flow growth and conversion were robust in Q1. Operating cash-flow increased 62% to $209 million from $129 million in the prior year quarter. Free-cash flow increased 98% to a $188 million from $95 million in the prior year quarter. Operating cash-flow conversion was 62% in Q1, the strong performance was driven by the timing of working capital items. While working capital will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, our goal remains to deliver a conversion rate of 50% to 60% over a multi-year period. As of December 31, we had a cash balance of $720 million, total debt of $3.9 billion and net-debt of $3.2 billion. Our weighted-average cost of debt is 3.7% and our nearest maturity date is in 2028. As we look ahead to the rest of the year, our goal is to release amazing new music from our talented roster of artists and songwriters. While some of the macro and release schedule driven pressures we saw in Q1 will impact Q2, our slate in the back-half of fiscal 2023 is strong. Featuring releases from some of our biggest stars, as well as our next-generation of talent from across the globe. There's no question that our industry is feeling the impacts of the macro-economic environment. From currency fluctuations and a dislocated ad market to the short-term choppiness inherent in our business, there are a number of variables that can obscure our underlying health. However, our resilience through challenging times has been proven and we remain confident in our future growth. Against that backdrop, we are resolved to capitalize on the powerful tailwinds that will drive our company forward. Thank you to everyone for joining us today and we'll now open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Benjamin Black from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBenjamin Black: Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Robert, I know you've only been in the seat for about a month now. But can you touch on where you potentially see opportunity for improvement within the organization and where you see potential for faster growth?\nRobert Kyncl: Thank you for the question, Benjamin. So yes, as you said yourself, I've been on the job for five weeks and have been digging in very quickly. Strategy at this point is, in development as I mentioned. I do have the benefit of understanding the industry from both sides, but to be honest, I'm still calibrating the site due to my short tenure on this one. So I'd like to have a little bit more time on that and in order to be thoughtful. But here's what I know, which is will very thoughtfully relocate resources to accelerate our technology investments and then to empower not only artists and songwriters, but also to drive efficiencies in the company. So that is something that I can tell you now and I think my actions speak louder than words. I've already made two appointments in that direction in the first month with the hiring of Tim and Ariel and I think we'll -- my goal is to accomplish all of that with continued focus on financial discipline and cost containment.\nBenjamin Black: And so, just a follow-up, if I may. Does that mean that you're planning to potentially cut costs, we've seen cost getting cut impacting music industry more broadly to our recent action from Spotify, for example, so any view on cost-containment more specific and if so, which areas would it be cutting from?\nRobert Kyncl: So one, the company has actually then much more measured and it's headcount growth, for instance, over the last few years than others in the industry, who are now undergoing significant layoffs. Two, we are all aware that cost transformation initiatives already underway for the last two to three years before any of this macroeconomic issues have emerged. So there's been a lot of momentum on this, that is probably putting us in a slightly different position than others. And but again, I'd like to reiterate that I'll be focusing on driving, reallocating resources, our internal resources in order to invest in technology and drive not only more tools for each monetization for creators, but also greater efficiencies for us.\nBenjamin Black: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sebastiano Petti from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nSebastiano Petti: Hi, thank you. Robert, I just wanted to ask Robert, one for Eric. Robert, are you concerned about the dilution of music from AI-generated content? Maybe given your unique perspective, given some of your prior roles, any impact. I love to hear your thoughts. And then for Eric, you touched on margin expansion was driven just by a strong operating results. Well ahead of expectations, wanted to see if maybe you could provide us a little bit of detail there, maybe unpack some of the underlying drivers in each segment that drove the robust margin expansion? Thank you.\nRobert Kyncl: Thank you, Sebastiano. So one, I'd like to say that AI is probably one of the most transformative things that humanity as ever seen, it has so many different implications. So because of that, yes, something very close attention to it than we across the company are. Two, there are many different ways to sort for the music industry, as well as for other industries, who own copyrighted material. And it really falls into four buckets, one, which is the use of existing copyrights to train generate of AI. The second one is a sampling of existing copyrights, as the basis for new and remixed AI content, AI generating Content. The use of AI to help and support creativity. So an assisted way to do that. And then most importantly, find ways to protect the graft of artists and songwriters from being diluted or replaced by generating AI-generated content, which is what you mentioned. But it's not just that question, it's all of these together that we as an industry and I don't mean just the music industry. But overall, sort of copyright owners need to work together with the AI platforms on. And I want to make sure that everybody understands that, you don't have to be forward-looking in order to address this, which of course we are. But you can also look into today's world, one can benefit our position in the future, where there is a lot of AI-generating content. And what I mean by that is, tracking of content, identifying and tracking of content on consumption platforms that can appropriately identify copyright and remunerate copyright holders, underpins all of this. And different platforms have different capabilities in this regard. Obviously, YouTube is most advanced with Content ID, something that all the others over seen. But there are others who lacked in this department and need to work on that because in the AI future, this would be a serious deficiency. So you can -- you will see us focusing on this quite a lot. Eric?\nEric Levin: Thank you, Sebastiano. So margin expansion. So, obviously this quarter, when you look at adjusted for the extra week, 210 basis-points increase in margin is substantive and we're proud of that. We focus on disciplined management, disciplined cost oversight and management. We can look at this quarter and see, for example, Warner Chappell had a 36% OIBDA increase. Pretty extraordinary kind of growth from that line of business. We are not targeting 200 basis points of increase on a consistent basis, we are targeting margin expansion. Generally on an annual basis, not every year will be exactly the same, but 0.5 point to 1 percentage point increase in margin. It's about what we look towards, again not every year is the same. So this is an exceptional quarter from margin enhancement, but margin enhancement as part of our strategy, for sure.\nSebastiano Petti: Thank you.\nEric Levin: Thank you, Sebastiano.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Benjamin Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Good morning, Robert. Nice meeting over the phone and welcome. I wanted to ask you a bit more about your comments around music being undervalued, obviously that have been a long going debate in the industry between the labels and distributors and given your seat on the other side of the negotiating table, I'd love to hear your thoughts on how do you affect that change in the industry from the CEO position at Warner Music Groups? Obviously, you don't get to dictate per se the pricing of the DSPs and sort of what you can extract from players like TikTok, but what do you think you can do given your experience at YouTube to accelerate the value capture at music. And then I just wanted to ask Eric, if I could have follow-up. And you said high single digit subscription streaming revenue organically I believe. Can that accelerate this year, is that a new normal in your mind that's obviously quite a bit lower than what we saw from Spotify, for example on an organic basis in premium revenue and I think the market is a bit concerned that the major labels may be losing share. So I'd love to get your thoughts on that. Thank you both.\nRobert Kyncl: Thank you. So one, I made my comments, so if I think everyone has been sort of stuck in the conversation, sort of one-on-one relationship between content providers and the DSPs. I look at it more from a more macro-level that the space is generally undervalued. And if you look at all the other indicators, how people pay for subscriptions and the price increases in various subscription, not just entertainment. It has been much more significant than it has been in music. And I think that is something that we have to all being be very mindful of. The -- I can't really get into the tactics of how we would achieve that, but what I can tell you is that, at YouTube we've had the history of executing and delivering on our plans. And that is precisely what I plan to bring here. And we've done so at least in the last five to seven years in an extremely collaborative manner. So that is also something that I plan to bring here. So I know, I'm not giving you much of the specifics other than -- other history of getting things done. And other history of being collaborative and I won the industry to go for everyone and I believe this is the right path.\nEric Levin: Thank you. Ben, good talking to you. So I would talk to our release schedule a little bit. So as we said, our fiscal Q1 release schedule in the U.S. was a little bit of a softer schedule that could have roll in and have some impact on Q2 as well this year. We have a second half fiscal '23 as second-half oriented release schedule or the strength of our release schedule tends to be more oriented this year towards the second-half and we think that will have a positive impact on streaming. If we just look back one quarter ago, our subscription streaming growth was in the teens, in the low-teens area. So release schedule does have a couple point impact. So we do think this has a fair amount to do with release schedule timing.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Thank you, both.\nEric Levin: Thanks, Ben.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Rich Greenfield from LightShed Partners. Your line is open.\nRich Greenfield: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Robert, it's great to have you on this call, I love sort of your perspective on how important you think music is, as TikTok's core product. And then sort of a related question. When you are at YouTube, I remember had the label, including Warner, pushed very aggressively for you to launch a subscription product in addition to sort of the marketing aspect of what YouTube did for music. I'm curious, if you think the same thing in terms of the push for subscription product will happen with TikTok?\nRobert Kyncl: Thank you, Richard. It's great to hear from you. So one, having lived through that. We made the decision to launch subscription at YouTube, because we were looking at the industry holistically and we had a fast-growing advertising business with free content to users, while at the same time subscription was somewhat nascent for the industry. And the industry really wanted us to invest into converting that large free user base into a paying user base. Obviously, you don't do it with all 2 billion users, you do at some fraction of it and great audience segmentation strategy and that's exactly what we did. So we decided that music is important to us forever, and therefore we should invest into it holistically. And obviously, that's also followed a further expansion into shortage later on. So the platform has done an incredible job, delivering multiple formats, super short format, with [indiscernible] music videos, user uploaded content, track and upload, copyrighted track, properly remunerated and subscription as well as life. So when you look at that from the point of view of content owner and content provider, it's a phenomenal partnership and phenomenal platform, that's exactly what we decided to do. I think for TikTok, to go to the beginning of your question. Well, let me also say, we've looked at this question very closely and we decided that it was important to us and that's why we did it. TikTok needs to do that, it's the right decision for them to evaluate. And you can see from YouTube's execution, what the results of the findings was for us, but again speak to what TikTok obviously finds. Sorry, I'm losing my voice. But my answer is, holistic relationship is what we're looking for.\nRich Greenfield: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from Matthew Thornton from Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nMatthew Thornton: Hi, good morning. Robert, welcome on-board and Eric, hope you're well. Maybe two if I could and related. First one, Eric, any update on emerging streaming and kind of how that trended in the quarter? And then relatedly, as you think about fiscal '23, is there any way to think about or handicap, whether we could get movements on the emerging streaming side, i.e., a new deal that would actually material to kind of pushing that business up higher. And/or continued price increase momentum this year that could be material to the subscription streaming side of the business? Any way to think about that impact or potential impact in '23 would be very helpful. Thanks guys.\nEric Levin: Sure, good to hear from you and appreciate the questions. This is Eric, I will -- let me tackle these more financially oriented. So in this quarter, there were no, but say significant renewals to note, sequentially emerging streaming was roughly flat, it's up about 20%, 20 some odd percent year-on year. So up substantially year on year. But generally, we have fixed fee deals, so it moves up as we renew deals with the current deal structures in place. Any movement on renewals, so the second question. So we don't specifically talk about individual deals and deal timing. What we have said is that, we had a series of deals we did in the 2021 timeframe and most of our deals in emerging streaming tend to be two to three years in length. Meaning that within fiscal 2023, there certainly will be discussions about new deals, when exactly those close and what form, whether there continues to be fixed fee or portions of them are variable as to be seeing. So we will keep you guys apprised as deals are renewed and the impact the category, but that is something where there'll be discussions ongoing throughout the year with some of our partners. On subscription price increases. So there have been some meaningful players and partners that have announced price increases and increased prices already. Apple, Amazon, Deezer, where we use to see that. Again we don't talk about individual deals, but generally we say with our largest subscription partners are deals tend to be variable and those will have -- those will obviously price increases will have a positive impact on growth. So in future quarters, those will be rolling through the subscription revenue numbers and we expect that to be a positive to the subscription growth kind of story this year. Thank you, Matthew. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Michael Morris from Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open.\nMichael Morris: Thank you. Good morning, guys. I have two questions, I think for Robert. My first is your comments about technology and innovation, new use cases and these appointments that you've made. It seems that, that element of the growth has largely been dependent on innovation from outside of the company and your participation there. Do you see areas to incrementally invest on the technology side and maybe bring any of those growth drivers in-house? I'd be curious what you think on that. My second question is about streaming share. Spotify reported their annual results recently and indicated that the share of streams attributed to major labels head again declined by another couple of 100 basis-points. And I'm curious, how you view that information? Whether you see that is sort of pervasive across your DSP partner relationships? What do you think it means and how do you address that going-forward? Thank you.\nRobert Kyncl: Sure, thank you. So there is no question that technology will underpin everything we do. Whether it's growth or whether it's efficiencies. And it's important that we invest into it and that's what we're doing. It's little too early for me to describe exactly what we'll do in that regard, but I think it gives you the option, investing into, it gives you the optionality to do that when we had the investment capital and can deployed against it. I think the only dilution question, I think it's something that you've been seeing all along, it's obviously something I keep an eye on that sort of considers a fair game. These are platforms where content providers are uploading content and we have to do a great job and having a robust catalog; b, more great artists that are gaining meaningful share and we have to do a great job with them, so the owners is on us.\nEric Levin: I would tack on to that Michael that, we obviously released music that we A&R and market ourselves. But we also have a significant business that is licensing and distributing Indie music. And we're constantly expanding our business globally to additional territories. Sometimes that involves acquiring or licensing music or partnering with local independent players. So the independent, as well as the major part of the business are both part of the business we participate in robust way. And it's part of our strategy to make sure, we're playing into the significant growth areas of the global music partner.\nMichael Morris: Thank you for that, Eric. If I could just follow up, because I think that's an important point. I don't know, if you can help quantify or help us with that. But do you think that, that data is sort of from Spotify and I don't mean to just pick them, but that as an example is sort of underestimating your actual participation because of your share of the Indie side as well.\nEric Levin: Some want to kind of respond to an individual platform, because we literally have hundreds of digital platforms that were licensed to it's portfolio, some of whom are global, some of whom are local, some of who are subscription, some of whom are ad-supportive, some are socially oriented. It is our job to -- one, the first thing is that the consumption of music across platforms globally, digital consumption continues to grow. That means that there is additional opportunities for us to license and monetize music. That's our job, not just to look at one platform, but to look at different platforms and develop and different territories and develop a strategy to drive growth. And it's our job to look at the different ways music is created and released and figure out the right strategy to participate in those. So for us, it's kind of a multi-layered, multi-tiered strategy and we believe that positions us well for continued strong growth.\nMichael Morris: Thank you very much.\nRobert Kyncl: Thanks, Michael. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kutgun Maral from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nKutgun Maral: Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up on the recorded music subscription revenue discussion from earlier, just because it has been a major area of debate. Eric, I know you talked about the impact of the release slate and content cyclicality and how that could cause a couple of 100 basis-points of volatility here and there. But the magnitude of the deceleration from Q4 to Q1 was perhaps at the upper-end of that, maybe even greater thinking through some benefits from the Apple Music price increase. So there's just a broader concern, there's something else going on beyond this market-share shifts. And so I wanted to confirm your views and maybe get a read on whether the Q1 growth rate of high single digits, it's may be an appropriate benchmark for Q2 ahead of your stronger back-half release schedule? Thank you.\nEric Levin: So thank you. So I would say, two things that affect streaming growth overall. One of which is release slate and the second one is there was we did see an additional slowdown in ad-supported streaming and we should spend a moment on that. So given the kind of dislocations are challenges in the macro-economy, we are seeing ad-supported streaming continue to slow-down and decelerate. Actually declined versus prior year and the decline is getting more pronounced. We have not seen it as a floor or start to rebound. So we're still seeing continued worsening in the ad-supported market. On the subscription side, we have looked at this and we did have a softer largely U.S. base release schedule this quarter and we do think that is what is driving the slowdown in this quarter, could roll into our fiscal Q2. But given our release schedule as second-half oriented this year, we do feel-good about our performance and -- of releases and strength in the second-half of the year.\nKutgun Maral: Great. Thanks, Eric.\nEric Levin: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question will come from Stephen Laszczyk from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nStephen Laszczyk: Hi, great. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Maybe just a follow-up on that last ad supported question, Eric. Could you remind us what portion of your total streaming revenues are driven by ad supported, excluding the emerging deals and to what extend there might be any timing differences in those revenues versus what we see out of the likes of Spotify or YouTube?\nEric Levin: There shouldn't be a meaningful timing difference. I think that -- so it is in the 10s kind of streaming revenue, call it, low-teens or maybe even kind of 12, 13 -- kind of -- low-teens kind of area. And we've seen a deceleration there and there shouldn't really be a meaningful timing difference, but others are seeing in the market.\nStephen Laszczyk: Got it, thanks for that. And maybe just one on Sync. Could you maybe talk a little bit more about the types of conversations your team is having with your Sync partners, maybe how much visibility they have into that piece of content creation or ad spend this year and maybe how that's trending compared to what we've seen in years past? Thank you.\nEric Levin: Well, it is -- if what you're getting to Stephen is, is the slowdown in the ad markets affecting Sync growth trends. The answer is to a degree, yes, we have seen that there are definitely an impact in the commercial/advertising markets. That growth has slowed in that category, although our teams are still seeing a lot of opportunities and potential for growth in film, TV and other categories as well as global Sync, non- U.S. based Sync. So last year we saw Sync in both recorded and publishing growing in the kind of 20% range year-on-year. Those numbers were pretty extraordinary, partly based on our new technologies we've rolled-out, enhancing our teams and our productivity in those markets. But we do see certainly in this quarter a somewhat softer market for Sync. We are managing that revenue line in both recorded and publishing for continued growth. But it is more challenging market, and our team certainly is targeting the areas that are more active and vital for critical Syncs and the commercial ad market is one they are seeing a degree of softness.\nStephen Laszczyk: Thank you very much.\nEric Levin: Thanks, Stephen. Greatly appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. And I am showing no further questions from our phone lines. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Robert Kyncl for any closing remarks.\nRobert Kyncl: All right. So thank you everyone for dialing in, asking questions and continuing to be interested in our business. I look forward to speaking with you frequently. And as I get up to speed, obviously continue to share more and more information in a very straight forward and transparent manner. So thank you very much. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Robert Kyncl",
            "content": "Thank you, Kareem, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to be here speaking with all of you for my first earnings call at Warner Music Group. I've been on the job for five weeks and I'm grateful to our Board of Directors, and our employees, artists and songwriters for giving me such a warm welcome. I would especially like to thank my predecessor, Steve Cooper, for everything he has done to position the company for long-term success, and for all his insights as I've been getting up to speed. Thanks also to you, our valued shareholders and everyone who follows the company for your continued support. So let's get into Q1 results. I am committed to maintaining straightforward and consistent communication with the investor community. So in that spirit, I want to immediately and clearly acknowledge that this was a tough quarter. Like most companies, WMG has been dealing with macroeconomic headwinds and the impact of currency exchange rates. It's important to note that last year's Q1 included an extra week of reporting, as a result, this quarter's comparisons need to be adjusted to provide an accurate picture and I'll be discussing our results in that context. Eric will give you more detail, but here are the headlines. Total revenue in Q1 grew 2% and adjusted OIBDA increased 13%, with 210 basis points of margin improvement. Recorded Music revenue was flat as the strength of our global performance was offset by a softer quarter in the U.S. We had a tough comparison with the prior year quarter, which included releases from some of our superstar artists. We're expecting a stronger release schedule in the back-half of the fiscal year, which will feature new music from Ed Sheeran, Cardi B, David Guetta, Aya Nakamura and BeBe Rexha. Music Publishing had another strong quarter with revenue growth of 14%. Our operating cash-flow growth was healthy, despite some of our revenue lines coming under pressure. This further underscores our disciplined fiscal management, as we navigate this challenging business environment. I'd like to spend some time on this call, proactively addressing two questions that have often been asked. Specifically, why I chose to go into the Music business and why I joined the Warner Music Group after 12 years at YouTube and seven years at Netflix. YouTube drives the intersection of creators and technology, which means that I had many options to choose from in planning my next chapter. I chose Music first and foremost, because everyone loves music including me. It's embraced by 100% of global population. In an increasingly digital world, music makes people feel and it brings them joy, hope and comfort, plus in an increasingly divided world, music brings people together. That engagement is very powerful and valuable and we expect the evolution of monetization models to reflect that. On top of that, music's global appeal is matched by its ubiquity. This industry has achieved something rare. It's build mutually beneficial, long-term partnerships with many of the world's biggest companies, Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta, Spotify and Tencent, among them. As successful as music has become, there is still meaningful upside ahead for three reasons. One, as technology opens up emerging economies, the industry's addressable market will continue to expand even further. Two, innovation is constantly creating new use cases for music, giving us the opportunity to diversify our revenue sources. Three, music is still undervalued, especially when compared to other forms of entertainment like video. I'd like to expand a bit on that last point. Since 2011, the subscription price of Netflix's standard service has roughly doubled. Data shows that almost 80% of U.S. households subscribed to at least three streaming video services. This means that the average household is spending more than four times per month on a combination of digital video services that isn't even a comprehensive offering. In contrast, the price of the music subscription has stayed the same since streaming was introduced over a decade ago. Most consumers subscribe to a single-service that carries virtually all the music ever released. Against this backdrop, it is encouraging that we're seeing first steps in the right direction by Apple, Deezer and Amazon. The other question I often get asked is why WMG? First and foremost, it's the artists and songwriters and powerful catalogs that are the lifeblood of this company and it's such a pleasure to bring this creative work depends around the world. The new generations of stars like Lizzo, Dua Lipa and Aya Nakamura; global superstars such as Ed Sheeran, Bruno Mars, Coldplay and Neil Young; songwriters and composers like Lin-Manuel Miranda, Gamble & Huff and John Williams; and legends such as John Coltrane, Led Zeppelin, Aretha Franklin and Prince. Second, it's the people at WMG. This company has a consistent decades-long history of finding and developing unique voices that change culture globally and then increasingly complex uncluttered world that originality is an essential ingredient of our success. Third is about size. WMG is big enough to drive meaningful change in the industry, but small enough to have plenty of room for growth. As just one example, the company has been taking thoughtful approach to global expansion. WMG has made world time moves that lead front the competition and dynamic fast-growing markets such as China and the Middle-East. This approach has also delivered record-breaking global first, with audits like Anita from Brazil, Paulo Londra from Argentina, King from India and CK from Nigeria. I wanted to briefly address what we're doing to architect the next phase of growth. I'm only five weeks in, but I've been very intentional about how we've gone about this. I made two significant appointments, both of which tell you something about our priorities going-forward. I hired Tim Matusch my former colleague at YouTube, as our new EVP of Strategy and Operations, which is a new role at WMG. Tim will be critical to facilitating our strategic vision and ensuring operational execution. I also hired Ariel Bardin, as our President of Technology. Ariel's career includes 16 years at Google, where he built, launched and let some of the company's most successful products, including YouTube's creator tools, memberships and content ID. He will drive the development of the systems, infrastructure and products needed to support our growth. As I've said, I'm committed to clear and straightforward communication on our progress. I also want you to know, I'm a big believer that actions speak louder than words and I'm laser-focused on execution. Right now, I'm working with leaders across the company to develop our plans for the future. We're already exploring some exciting ideas and initiatives and we will provide you with updates as soon as appropriate.  That said, many of the fundamentals will remain the same. The foundations of this company are very strong and the music industry is rich with opportunities. We will continue to invest in new artists and songwriters, our catalog and our global expansion. At the same time, we plan to thoughtfully reallocate some resources to accelerate how we use technology and data to empower artists and songwriters, as well as drive greater efficiency in our business. As subscription revenue continues to grow, as supported recovers and we explore the possibilities of new technologies and business models, it's essential we structure our deals smartly and strategically. I am approaching this next phase of growth with the unique benefits of having been on both sides of the table. I am proud that over the last five years at YouTube, we developed a very collaborative mutually beneficial relationship with the music industry, after years of rocky ones. I plan on bringing in the same approach to the WMG and the industry, so that our interests are aligned with our partners and that our artists and songwriters gain maximum participation and monetization. Now, I'll pass it over to Eric, who will take you through our results and then we'll answer your questions. Thank you for the question, Benjamin. So yes, as you said yourself, I've been on the job for five weeks and have been digging in very quickly. Strategy at this point is, in development as I mentioned. I do have the benefit of understanding the industry from both sides, but to be honest, I'm still calibrating the site due to my short tenure on this one. So I'd like to have a little bit more time on that and in order to be thoughtful. But here's what I know, which is will very thoughtfully relocate resources to accelerate our technology investments and then to empower not only artists and songwriters, but also to drive efficiencies in the company. So that is something that I can tell you now and I think my actions speak louder than words. I've already made two appointments in that direction in the first month with the hiring of Tim and Ariel and I think we'll -- my goal is to accomplish all of that with continued focus on financial discipline and cost containment. So one, the company has actually then much more measured and it's headcount growth, for instance, over the last few years than others in the industry, who are now undergoing significant layoffs. Two, we are all aware that cost transformation initiatives already underway for the last two to three years before any of this macroeconomic issues have emerged. So there's been a lot of momentum on this, that is probably putting us in a slightly different position than others. And but again, I'd like to reiterate that I'll be focusing on driving, reallocating resources, our internal resources in order to invest in technology and drive not only more tools for each monetization for creators, but also greater efficiencies for us. Thank you, Sebastiano. So one, I'd like to say that AI is probably one of the most transformative things that humanity as ever seen, it has so many different implications. So because of that, yes, something very close attention to it than we across the company are. Two, there are many different ways to sort for the music industry, as well as for other industries, who own copyrighted material. And it really falls into four buckets, one, which is the use of existing copyrights to train generate of AI. The second one is a sampling of existing copyrights, as the basis for new and remixed AI content, AI generating Content. The use of AI to help and support creativity. So an assisted way to do that. And then most importantly, find ways to protect the graft of artists and songwriters from being diluted or replaced by generating AI-generated content, which is what you mentioned. But it's not just that question, it's all of these together that we as an industry and I don't mean just the music industry. But overall, sort of copyright owners need to work together with the AI platforms on. And I want to make sure that everybody understands that, you don't have to be forward-looking in order to address this, which of course we are. But you can also look into today's world, one can benefit our position in the future, where there is a lot of AI-generating content. And what I mean by that is, tracking of content, identifying and tracking of content on consumption platforms that can appropriately identify copyright and remunerate copyright holders, underpins all of this. And different platforms have different capabilities in this regard. Obviously, YouTube is most advanced with Content ID, something that all the others over seen. But there are others who lacked in this department and need to work on that because in the AI future, this would be a serious deficiency. So you can -- you will see us focusing on this quite a lot. Eric? Thank you. So one, I made my comments, so if I think everyone has been sort of stuck in the conversation, sort of one-on-one relationship between content providers and the DSPs. I look at it more from a more macro-level that the space is generally undervalued. And if you look at all the other indicators, how people pay for subscriptions and the price increases in various subscription, not just entertainment. It has been much more significant than it has been in music. And I think that is something that we have to all being be very mindful of. The -- I can't really get into the tactics of how we would achieve that, but what I can tell you is that, at YouTube we've had the history of executing and delivering on our plans. And that is precisely what I plan to bring here. And we've done so at least in the last five to seven years in an extremely collaborative manner. So that is also something that I plan to bring here. So I know, I'm not giving you much of the specifics other than -- other history of getting things done. And other history of being collaborative and I won the industry to go for everyone and I believe this is the right path. Thank you, Richard. It's great to hear from you. So one, having lived through that. We made the decision to launch subscription at YouTube, because we were looking at the industry holistically and we had a fast-growing advertising business with free content to users, while at the same time subscription was somewhat nascent for the industry. And the industry really wanted us to invest into converting that large free user base into a paying user base. Obviously, you don't do it with all 2 billion users, you do at some fraction of it and great audience segmentation strategy and that's exactly what we did. So we decided that music is important to us forever, and therefore we should invest into it holistically. And obviously, that's also followed a further expansion into shortage later on. So the platform has done an incredible job, delivering multiple formats, super short format, with [indiscernible] music videos, user uploaded content, track and upload, copyrighted track, properly remunerated and subscription as well as life. So when you look at that from the point of view of content owner and content provider, it's a phenomenal partnership and phenomenal platform, that's exactly what we decided to do. I think for TikTok, to go to the beginning of your question. Well, let me also say, we've looked at this question very closely and we decided that it was important to us and that's why we did it. TikTok needs to do that, it's the right decision for them to evaluate.

            "name": "Eric Levin",
            "content": "Thank you, Robert and good morning, everyone. As Robert mentioned, our year-over-year comparisons should take into account the impact of the extra week in fiscal Q1, 2022. Adjusting for the extra week, we delivered growth across key metrics, including revenue, adjusted OIBDA and adjusted OIBDA margin. Additionally, we saw strong operating cash-flow growth and strong cash conversion as a percentage of adjusted OIBDA, despite a challenging macro-environment. Total revenue declined 2.7%, but increased 2% when adjusted for the impact of the extra week. Adjusted OIBDA was flat and increased 12.8% when adjusted for the extra week. Adjusted OIBDA margin was 22.5% compared to 21.9% in the prior year quarter. Adjusting for the extra week, margin increased 210 basis-points. These increases were primarily due to disciplined operating performance and the impact of currency exchange rates. Recorded Music revenue declined 5.6%, that was roughly flat when adjusting for the impact of the extra week. Streaming revenue decreased by 2.6%, after adjusting for the extra week Streaming revenue grew by 5%, as subscription streaming revenue grew by high-single-digits and was partially offset by ad-supported revenue declining in the mid-teens. Physical revenue declined 27%, adjusting for the extra week, Physical declined 22%. Our Streaming and Physical results reflect a lighter release schedule we had this quarter compared with the prior year period, which included releases from Ed Sheeran and Coldplay. Artist services and expanded rights revenue decreased by 4%, due to macro-economic pressures affecting our E&P business and lower advertising revenue. Licensing increased 17% due to an increase in broadcast fees, synchronization and other third-party licensing. Recorded music adjusted OIBDA decreased by 6% with margin of 24.1%, which was roughly flat compared to the prior year quarter. Excluding the impact of the extra week, adjusted OIBDA grew 7% and the margin improvement was approximately 150 basis-points. This was driven by disciplined operating performance and the favorable impact of currency exchange rates. Music Publishing continues to deliver strong results, posting 14% growth, driven by strength across digital, performance and mechanical. Digital revenue grew 16%, reflecting growth in streaming, which increased 17% driven by continued growth in streaming services and timing of new digital deals. Performance revenue increased by 29%, due to continued growth from bars, restaurants, concerts and live events. Mechanical revenue increased by 17%, due to growth in France and Sync revenue decreased by 5%, due to lower commercial licensing activity in the U.S. and the timing of legal settlements. Music Publishing adjusted OIBDA increased 36% to $72 million with margin increasing 460 basis points, driven by strong operating performance and the favorable impact of currency exchange rates. Q1 CapEx decreased to $21 million as compared to $34 million in the prior year quarter, mainly due to lower facilities investments. We anticipate some acceleration in the coming quarters, driven by IT infrastructure facilities and financial transformation investments. Our financial transformation program remains on-track to meaningfully rollout in fiscal 2024 and expand globally in the following years. The program is expected to deliver annualized run rate savings of $35 million to $40 million once fully implemented. Operating and free-cash flow growth and conversion were robust in Q1. Operating cash-flow increased 62% to $209 million from $129 million in the prior year quarter. Free-cash flow increased 98% to a $188 million from $95 million in the prior year quarter. Operating cash-flow conversion was 62% in Q1, the strong performance was driven by the timing of working capital items. While working capital will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, our goal remains to deliver a conversion rate of 50% to 60% over a multi-year period. As of December 31, we had a cash balance of $720 million, total debt of $3.9 billion and net-debt of $3.2 billion. Our weighted-average cost of debt is 3.7% and our nearest maturity date is in 2028. As we look ahead to the rest of the year, our goal is to release amazing new music from our talented roster of artists and songwriters. While some of the macro and release schedule driven pressures we saw in Q1 will impact Q2, our slate in the back-half of fiscal 2023 is strong. Featuring releases from some of our biggest stars, as well as our next-generation of talent from across the globe. There's no question that our industry is feeling the impacts of the macro-economic environment. From currency fluctuations and a dislocated ad market to the short-term choppiness inherent in our business, there are a number of variables that can obscure our underlying health. However, our resilience through challenging times has been proven and we remain confident in our future growth. Against that backdrop, we are resolved to capitalize on the powerful tailwinds that will drive our company forward. Thank you to everyone for joining us today and we'll now open the call for questions. Thank you, Sebastiano. So margin expansion. So, obviously this quarter, when you look at adjusted for the extra week, 210 basis-points increase in margin is substantive and we're proud of that. We focus on disciplined management, disciplined cost oversight and management. We can look at this quarter and see, for example, Warner Chappell had a 36% OIBDA increase. Pretty extraordinary kind of growth from that line of business. We are not targeting 200 basis points of increase on a consistent basis, we are targeting margin expansion. Generally on an annual basis, not every year will be exactly the same, but 0.5 point to 1 percentage point increase in margin. It's about what we look towards, again not every year is the same. So this is an exceptional quarter from margin enhancement, but margin enhancement as part of our strategy, for sure. Thank you, Sebastiano. Thank you. Ben, good talking to you. So I would talk to our release schedule a little bit. So as we said, our fiscal Q1 release schedule in the U.S. was a little bit of a softer schedule that could have roll in and have some impact on Q2 as well this year. We have a second half fiscal '23 as second-half oriented release schedule or the strength of our release schedule tends to be more oriented this year towards the second-half and we think that will have a positive impact on streaming. If we just look back one quarter ago, our subscription streaming growth was in the teens, in the low-teens area. So release schedule does have a couple point impact. So we do think this has a fair amount to do with release schedule timing. Thanks, Ben. Sure, good to hear from you and appreciate the questions. This is Eric, I will -- let me tackle these more financially oriented. So in this quarter, there were no, but say significant renewals to note, sequentially emerging streaming was roughly flat, it's up about 20%, 20 some odd percent year-on year. So up substantially year on year. But generally, we have fixed fee deals, so it moves up as we renew deals with the current deal structures in place. Any movement on renewals, so the second question. So we don't specifically talk about individual deals and deal timing. What we have said is that, we had a series of deals we did in the 2021 timeframe and most of our deals in emerging streaming tend to be two to three years in length. Meaning that within fiscal 2023, there certainly will be discussions about new deals, when exactly those close and what form, whether there continues to be fixed fee or portions of them are variable as to be seeing. So we will keep you guys apprised as deals are renewed and the impact the category, but that is something where there'll be discussions ongoing throughout the year with some of our partners. On subscription price increases. So there have been some meaningful players and partners that have announced price increases and increased prices already. Apple, Amazon, Deezer, where we use to see that. Again we don't talk about individual deals, but generally we say with our largest subscription partners are deals tend to be variable and those will have -- those will obviously price increases will have a positive impact on growth. So in future quarters, those will be rolling through the subscription revenue numbers and we expect that to be a positive to the subscription growth kind of story this year. Thank you, Matthew. I appreciate it. I would tack on to that Michael that, we obviously released music that we A&R and market ourselves. But we also have a significant business that is licensing and distributing Indie music. And we're constantly expanding our business globally to additional territories. Sometimes that involves acquiring or licensing music or partnering with local independent players. So the independent, as well as the major part of the business are both part of the business we participate in robust way. And it's part of our strategy to make sure, we're playing into the significant growth areas of the global music partner. Some want to kind of respond to an individual platform, because we literally have hundreds of digital platforms that were licensed to it's portfolio, some of whom are global, some of whom are local, some of who are subscription, some of whom are ad-supportive, some are socially oriented. It is our job to -- one, the first thing is that the consumption of music across platforms globally, digital consumption continues to grow. That means that there is additional opportunities for us to license and monetize music. That's our job, not just to look at one platform, but to look at different platforms and develop and different territories and develop a strategy to drive growth. And it's our job to look at the different ways music is created and released and figure out the right strategy to participate in those. So for us, it's kind of a multi-layered, multi-tiered strategy and we believe that positions us well for continued strong growth. So thank you. So I would say, two things that affect streaming growth overall. One of which is release slate and the second one is there was we did see an additional slowdown in ad-supported streaming and we should spend a moment on that. So given the kind of dislocations are challenges in the macro-economy, we are seeing ad-supported streaming continue to slow-down and decelerate. Actually declined versus prior year and the decline is getting more pronounced. We have not seen it as a floor or start to rebound. So we're still seeing continued worsening in the ad-supported market. On the subscription side, we have looked at this and we did have a softer largely U.S. base release schedule this quarter and we do think that is what is driving the slowdown in this quarter, could roll into our fiscal Q2. But given our release schedule as second-half oriented this year, we do feel-good about our performance and -- of releases and strength in the second-half of the year. Thank you. There shouldn't be a meaningful timing difference. I think that -- so it is in the 10s kind of streaming revenue, call it, low-teens or maybe even kind of 12, 13 -- kind of -- low-teens kind of area. And we've seen a deceleration there and there shouldn't really be a meaningful timing difference, but others are seeing in the market. Well, it is -- if what you're getting to Stephen is, is the slowdown in the ad markets affecting Sync growth trends. The answer is to a degree, yes, we have seen that there are definitely an impact in the commercial/advertising markets. That growth has slowed in that category, although our teams are still seeing a lot of opportunities and potential for growth in film, TV and other categories as well as global Sync, non- U.S. based Sync. So last year we saw Sync in both recorded and publishing growing in the kind of 20% range year-on-year. Those numbers were pretty extraordinary, partly based on our new technologies we've rolled-out, enhancing our teams and our productivity in those markets. But we do see certainly in this quarter a somewhat softer market for Sync. We are managing that revenue line in both recorded and publishing for continued growth. But it is more challenging market, and our team certainly is targeting the areas that are more active and vital for critical Syncs and the commercial ad market is one they are seeing a degree of softness. Thanks, Stephen. Greatly appreciate it."

And with that, I'll turn it over to Robert.\nRobert Kyncl: Thanks, Kareem, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased with our progress, both this quarter and this year, as we've demonstrated our strength and adaptability in a highly competitive market. Today, I'll provide more context on how we're positioning the company for sustained growth and to deliver even greater value for our artists, songwriters, and shareholders. First, let me give you a quick summary of our Q4 results. These are normalized for all previously disclosed non-recurring items. We delivered an 11% jump in Recorded Music subscription streaming revenue, driven by strong releases and assisted by global subscriber growth and price increases. This was our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Total revenue was up 6% with Recorded Music up 6%, and Music Publishing up 5%. And adjusted OIBDA grew 14% with margin increasing 150 basis points. Our robust Q4 results contributed to full-year revenue and adjusted OIBDA growth of 7% and 11%, respectively. The year was highlighted by recorded music subscription streaming growth of 12%. Our strategy is designed to enhance our ability to attract original artists and songwriters at every stage of their development. We help them realize their musical visions, cut through the noise, build sustainable careers, and grow passionate and loyal fan bases. This year, we've reimagined our organization based on the principle that simplicity and focus drive higher intensity and impact. We've done a lot of important work, which has set us up for success today and will help us grow more profitably in the future. We strengthened our presence in the US, the world's largest music market. We've shifted to a simpler and flatter organization structure to create faster and more direct channels for local talent to reach the global stage. And we preorganized key business lines such as catalog and distribution in order to deliver greater global reach. We continue to find ways to strengthen the coordination across our Recorded Music and Music Publishing divisions and we fixed a lot of foundational infrastructure issues that will now enable our technology team to be more offensively focused. I'd like to dive a little deeper into these changes and tell you about some of the further steps we've taken this quarter. In the U.S., we have two flagship record label groups, Atlantic and Warner Records, important twin engines for growth. As part of our structural changes, we elevated Elliot Grainge to lead Atlantic. While this kind of transition is never easy, this was a seamlessly executed handover. The team has delivered first-class results for priority projects while bringing in fresh ideas, onboarding dynamic executives, and attracting exciting new artists. With a digitally native approach, the Atlantic team will expand and diversify our artist roster and increase the volume of releases. While all of this is going on, the label has kicked off our new fiscal year with a bang, APT, the collaboration between Korean Superstar Rose, who we signed just a few months ago, and Bruno Mars immediately shouted to number one on the Spotify and Billboard Global charts. With this absolutely massive headline, Rose is the first female K-pop solo artist to break into Top 10 on Billboard Hot 100. Bruno Mars is the biggest artist in the world. He has the largest reach of anyone with 130 million monthly listeners on Spotify. This week, he holds two top positions on the Billboard Global 200 chart with APT and Die With a Smile, his Grammy-nominated collaboration with Lady Gaga. Other Atlantic successes include Coldplay landing their first number one album in a decade in the US, new albums from Don Toliver and The Marias, both of which continued to build strongly months after their release, and the impactful remix of Charli XCX's BRAT album and her seven Grammy nominations, including Album of the Year and Record of the Year. At the same time, the Atlantic team is bringing through the next generation of talent. Artemas reached 1 billion streams with his smashes I Like the Way You Kiss Me. Forrest Frank and Jordan Adetunji received their first Grammy nominations. Jazz artist Shazil sand songwriter Sam Barber and rapper Honcho are taking off. And competitive new signings include Fash for the World and 1900. Elliot and his team have an impressive ability to discover extraordinary talent across multiple genres and find fresh ways to help both established and emerging artists stand out from the crowd. At Warner Records, the team's commitment to artist development is driving hits and creating superstars. Under the leadership of Aaron Bay-Schuck and Tom Corson, the label's market share hit a new peak this year, reaching the number three position in the U.S. for current releases. They're hoping the likes of Teddy Swims, Benson Boone and Ali Chapa and Zach Bryan have worldwide smashes with real staying power. For example, Teddy's number one single, Loose Control, has spent an impressive 44 weeks in the Top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100. And Ali Chapa's carrier streams crossed the $9 billion mark at the right old age of 22. And it's great to see that label mates Teddy and Benson are up for best new artists at the Grammys. At the same time, Warner Records has been integral to the successful resurgence of icons like Green Day, Cher and Linkin Park, who have triumphantly returned with their first album in seven years. The first since the tragic death of lead singer Chester Bennington. The band's new album, From Zero, had the most in pre-says on WMG history, while the band embarked on a massive global tour. As I've said many times, the power of new releases drives engagement runs artist catalog and vice versa. We created a virtual cycle of consumption that views an uplift across the artists' entire body of work. For example, when Linkin Park's new single The Emptiness Machine dropped in September, and the band's new album was announced, their streams jumped by 0.5 billion compared to the same quarter last year. I cannot stress enough how exhilarating it is to watch the creative success that both Warner Records and Atlantic are having. Through our shift to a flatter organizational structure, we've elevated our regional leadership across Latin America, EMEA and APAC. This has created faster, more direct channels for local talent to access the global stage. This quarter, we continued to take steps that expand our presence in both mature and high-growth markets. In Japan, the second largest music market, we appointed a new leadership duo, CEO, Takeshi Okada; and Chairman, Kenji Kitatani. In Korea, we launched MPLIFY, a new label focused on English language music. In Benelux, we bought a leading India label Cloud 9 Recordings. In Africa, we completed our acquisition of Africori, the region's leading distribution company. And Warner Music Latina joined forces with India label Street Mob Records, an incubator of new Mexican talent. Our focus on bringing a wider array of local talent to stardom is paying off. We have vibrant music from homegrown heroes topping charts in many territories. We've had number one singles and albums by the likes of Soprano in France, Speed in Australia, Ayliva in Germany, Bien in Kenya, [Indiscernible] in Italy, Wu in Vietnam and King in India. We've also helped our global superstars reach new heights around the world. For example, Dua Lipa became the first female artist to have two albums exceed 13 billion streams each on Spotify. Before we move on, I'd like to spotlight the territory we believe has huge global potential. With a population of 1.4 billion, India is more like a continent than a country. It has the 5th largest GDP, but it's still only the 14th largest music market in the world. That gap will continue to close in the coming years. And as it does, India will become an increasingly influential global force in the music business. The country has already seen a significant increase in paid subscribers, which have increased by almost 40% since last year, but it still has less than 2% penetration. A few weeks ago, I visited our offices in India and met with our team, artists and partners, and it was very inspiring. Since launching there in 2020, we partnered with the most important local players as well as buying stakes in, and acquiring outright local music companies such as E-Positive, Divo and Global Music Junction. Earlier this month, we made our latest move on buying a stake in SkillBox, a leading ticketing and live events platform. We're helping Indian stars like Diljit Dosanjh and King reach new audiences, while building loyal Indian fan bases of global talent such as Coldplay and Dua Lipa, for both touring there in the coming months. As a result, we've seen an impressive revenue growth by over 100% in fiscal 2024. And most importantly, everything we're doing means we're well-positioned to keep taking market share as India continues its explosive growth. In our catalog and distribution divisions, we've made changes that better align our expertise and resources with the growing global opportunities for artists where previously, we were operating on a country-by-country basis, now we've globalized our operations. Our dedicated centrally managed global teams enable us to share learnings, leverage best practices, and deploy technology to find efficient ways of having greater worldwide impact. Turning to Music Publishing, the business continues to deliver impressive results. The 14% growth in total revenue on a normalized basis for the full year represents our fourth consecutive year of double-digit revenue growth. This was led by 19% streaming growth on a normalized basis. We're contributing to global hits, strengthening our services and monetizing deeper into our catalog. Here are a few recent high points. Three of the five Grammy nominees for Songwriter of the Year are Warner Chappell writers. Amy Allen, RAYE and Jessi Alexander. Warner Chappell is number two for a second consecutive quarter on Billboard's top radio airplay rankings and rising to number two on the Hot 100 songs chart with 25% market share. And Warner Chappell is number one on the German half-year charts with its writers spending 18 of 26 weeks at number one on the sales chart. Despite all this success, we are investing on our laurels and we've continued to invest into our future growth by forging new partnerships with Analog Metaverse, the company founded by Grammy award-winning producer Salaam Remi, launching a venture with the widely respected British dance label Defected Records, and appointing new leadership in high growth territories such as Lisa Li in China and Sophia Hong in Korea. We're very optimistic about the future at Warner Music Group. We have the right team and strategy to deliver long-term profitable growth in a dynamic and thriving industry. We continue to build strong mutually beneficial relationships with our partners to grow the value of music. With penetration in mature markets expected to increase from approximately 35% today to nearly 50% by 2030, and emerging markets going from single to low double-digits over the same timeframe, music subscriber growth should remain healthy for the years to come. For reference, in the U.S., cable TV penetration is a little over 50%, and the swap penetration is approaching 50%. Highlighting that even in a mature market, music penetration is very low and has plenty of runway ahead. With both subscriber growth and opportunities for wholesale price increases, the formula for streaming growth is strong and there is plenty of room for acceleration. Our focus on efficiency has freed up capital, enabling us to increase our investments in growth opportunities. As we previously promised, we've increased our A&R investment by approximately 11% in fiscal 2024, as we continue to sign new artists and songwriters and acquire IP and catalogs, all while driving our digital transformation. As part of our investment strategy, we will consider bolt-on acquisitions that accelerate our progress, while meeting our return thresholds. In addition to these investment opportunities, I wanted to note that our Board has authorized a share repurchase program of up to $100 million. The program demonstrates our confidence in the value of our company and our optimism for the path ahead. Our confidence is underpinned by the strong momentum we're carrying into 2025 with an exciting release slate that includes projects from Rose, Dua Lipa, Teddy Swims, Jack Harlow, Benson Boone, Myke Towers, David Guetta, Burna Boy, FKA twigs and more. We're excited by the opportunities ahead and look forward to delivering more culture-shaping music in 2025 and beyond. And now over to you, Brian.\nBryan Castellani: Thank you, Robert, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into our results, I want to remind everyone that growth rate comparisons will be in constant currency and where appropriate, I will reference normalized growth metrics. There are items throughout the quarter and the year that affect comparability. The details and adjustments relating to these items can be found in our earnings press release. In Q4, total revenue grew 3%, and adjusted OIBDA increased 11% with a margin of 21.7%, an increase of 170 basis points over the prior-year quarter. On a normalized basis, total revenue grew 6%, adjusted OIBDA increased 14%, and margin increased 150 basis points. Recorded Music revenue increased 4%, and grew 6% on a normalized basis, led by subscription streaming, which grew 11%, our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Ad support streaming declined by 6%, as we lapped last year's TikTok renewal and saw the revenue impact of Meta's exit from premium music videos. Physical revenue increased 5%, driven by strong releases in the U.S. and Japan, while artist services and expanded rights revenue increased 3%, primarily due to higher concert promotion revenue in Japan. Licensing revenue increased 33%, driven by increased revenue from copyright infringement settlements, primarily in the U.S. and growth in broadcast use. Recorded Music adjusted OIBDA increased 13% with a margin of 23.7%, an increase of 200 basis points. On a normalized basis, adjusted OIBDA increased 14%, and margin increased 160 basis points. Our Music Publishing results reflect the $17 million benefit from the CRB rate increase in the prior year quarter, adjusted for that benefit, Music Publishing total revenue increased 5% while Digital increased 6%, and Streaming increased 5%. These growth rates compared against the prior-year quarter, which saw robust streaming growth of 17%, and reflect continued market and catalog growth as well as timing of payments. Sync revenue increased 15%, reflecting an increase in copyright infringement settlements, primarily in the U.S., while performance revenue decreased 2%. Mechanical revenue decreased 12% due to lower physical sales and timing of distributions. Music Publishing adjusted OIBDA grew 11% with a margin of 28.1%, an increase of 290 basis points. On a normalized basis, adjusted OIBDA increased 17% and margin increased 280 basis points. For the full year, total company revenue grew 7%, and adjusted OIBDA grew 16% with a margin of 22.3%, an increase of 180 basis points. On a normalized basis, total revenue grew 7%, and adjusted OIBDA grew 11% with a margin of 21.4%. Adjusted OIBDA margin increased 70 basis points as strong operating performance and savings from our restructuring programs were partially offset by increased investment in A&R as well as revenue mix. Recorded Music revenue increased 6%, and adjusted OIBDA grew 17% with margin expansion of 240 basis points. On a normalized basis, Recorded Music revenue increased 6% with adjusted OIBDA growth of 11%, and margin expansion of 110 basis points. These results reflect streaming revenue growth of 10%, led by strength in subscription streaming, which grew 12%. Music Publishing revenue and adjusted OIBDA both increased 11%. On a normalized basis, Music Publishing revenue increased 14%, and adjusted OIBDA increased 13%. Q4 operating cash flow decreased 10% to $304 million from $338 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by timing of working capital items, partially offset by the timing of severance payments. Free cash flow decreased 10% to $271 million from $300 million in the prior year quarter. For the full-year, operating cash flow increased 10% to $754 million and free cash flow increased 14% to $638 million. Operating cash flow conversion was 53% of adjusted OIBDA for the full year, in line with our target of 50% to 60% despite increased investment in A&R and shifts in deal timing. As of September 30th, we had a cash balance of $694 million, total debt of $4 billion, and net debt of $3.3 billion. Our weighted average cost of debt was 4.3% and our nearest maturity date remains 2028. We continue to actively manage and improve our capital structure, most recently repricing our term loan in September, which has led to continued improvements in our debt ratings with both S&P and Fitch assigning us investment grade ratings in August and September, respectively. I'd like to reiterate that as a result of actions taken in Q4 to reorganize our Recorded Music business, we now expect our restructuring plan to generate pre-tax cost savings of $260 million and we continue to expect a significant majority of these savings to be achieved by the end of fiscal 2025. Looking ahead, our strong Q4 momentum in 2024 is carrying into 2025. Subscription streaming continues to see healthy underlying trends and we expect high single-digit growth for fiscal 2025 on a multi-year basis. Additionally, our goal remains to deliver margin expansion of 100 basis points and operating cash flow conversion of 50% to 60% of adjusted OIBDA on a multi-year basis. As a reminder, there are a number of previously disclosed items that will impact comparability in Q1. Streaming growth will be impacted by the BMG digital distribution roll-off, the digital license renewal in the prior year, and the lapping of Spotify price increases. Our digital distribution relationship with BMG that was planned to roll off by the end of fiscal '24 will now continue into fiscal '25. The revenue impact in Q1 is approximately $16 million versus the prior year quarter. And the digital license renewal with one of our international partners was $27 million in the prior year quarter. Our physical distribution relationship with BMG has largely rolled off. We expect there to be an unfavorable revenue impact of $15 million to $20 million in Q1. Licensing revenue will reflect the $68 million catalog licensing agreement extension we disclosed in Q1 \u201824. Finally, Artist services revenue will reflect the exit of our owned and operated media properties, which contributed $20 million in the prior year quarter. The music industry remains healthy and we continue to see positive subscriber growth and penetration trends as well as opportunities for wholesale pricing growth. We are excited about the slate this year and look forward to delivering great music. The momentum in the business is strong and we are positioning ourselves for long-term success. Thank you for joining us today. We'll now open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kutgun Maral with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.\nKutgun Maral: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just at a high level one on the broader music industry. Looking at the labels specifically, the industry construct remains very attractive. There's healthy competition for sure, but the big three still drive roughly two-thirds of global Recorded Music revenue and our must-haves for any platform. And structurally, you continue to see improvements with DSP price increases and the shift to artist-centric royalty models. So a very healthy and encouraging backdrop. On the other hand, I think as investors have looked at the other parts of the ecosystem, a lot of value has instead accrued to the DSPs and even certain live entertainment companies in part because of a view that they are at the forefront of capturing a greater share of wallet from consumers and monetizing the growing power of music. I'm not saying that those companies are undeserving of Wall Street's optimism, but it seems like the perceived potential for the labels has lagged despite their crucial role in everything. So I don't know if it's changing the dynamics with the DSPs and ad-supported tiers or a reimagined approach to super fans. But can you share your views on what the biggest opportunities for WMG are over the next few years to better participate in what seems to be a very robust growth profile for the overall music industry? Thanks.\nRobert Kyncl: Sure. Thank you. Thanks for the question. So I see this in two different buckets. Bucket number one is the obvious moves. And in those, I'm focused on two big ones, which is reduction of discounts in family plans and more frequent PSM escalators. So it's very simple. It comes down to these two levers, and they're very obvious moves for the industry for a company like WMG, and they are not a zero-sum move between us and the DSPs, they can actually be in concert with each other. And then the second bucket is in more innovations and that's where sort of a superfan tier like the Music Pro that's been discussed a lot, or other SKUs, some which may include ads and sort of just innovation around SKUs, and audience segmentation. Those are also potential upsides for all of us. My focus is in the order that I described, which is obvious moves first, those two specifically, and then the innovations. And all of these things would be sort of incremental to the glide path that you guys see for the industry.\nKutgun Maral: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Benjamin Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Thanks. Good morning. I guess I had two questions. Robert, you gave us some helpful context around the management changes. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about what is -- what works and is working so well at 10-K, Elliot's label that you guys acquired last year, that is or isn't applicable to the larger business of Atlantic. I'm thinking about things like artist discovery, marketing contracts, anything that you think we should be thinking about as that -- he steps into obviously or has stepped into a much larger, broader, and important role? And how this new structure, flatter structure translates into faster growth for the company, which maybe you're already seeing, but would love to get some more color on all of that. And then, you and Bryan both mentioned opportunities in wholesale pricing in your prepared remarks. So I figured I might as well follow up. I think you're in the midst of your Spotify renewal right now. So I thought maybe you could talk a little bit about your optimism to what seems like a pretty substantial change, maybe not, but seems like a substantial change to the way retail wholesale economics work? Thanks.\nRobert Kyncl: Sounds good. Thank you, Ben. All right. So let me start with -- I think with Elliot. So when you think about the music industry today, there are obviously lots of different independent music companies, many of whom claim to do many things really, really well. I would say you have to take everything with a great grain of salt. But one of those that surely did that was 10-K. I know that's a fact from the numbers that both they had prior and the numbers that they have delivered in the first year under the WMG umbrella, which was a phenomenal growth both on top line and bottom line. The skill set that they bring and it's not just Elliot, it's also his team. The skill set that they bring is being very digitally native. Today, the vast majority of our revenue is coming through streaming. Promotion mostly happens online. You must be digitally native if you want to succeed today and in the future in the music industry. And that is important to the DNA of the company. And they have brought that. The other part that they bring is intensity. When you start a company of that size, you start from scratch, bootstrap it. You have to be incredibly intense about everything that you do. And I love that about that. You also create strong points of view on various decisions. And I can tell you that all of these things, they touch -- developing artists, aspiring artists as well as superstars. Everybody wants to have broad reach, have hits, have loyal type fan bases and obviously they monetize it really well. But if you're somebody who is just starting, you need to build an audience. If you're a superstar, you want to keep the audience, either way, it comes to that. So this digital-first mindset from 10-K has translated really well into the company. And it also goes to their talent development. I named two artists who are, Forrest Frank and Jordan, who are for the first Grammys, and it's amazing to see that. So that's one. At the same time, you have to be really great at working well in a larger organization like WMG, which means you have to have a flexible mindset and work well with others. And Elliot does that incredibly well. So I'm really, really pleased with how things are going. On your wholesale question, I think the way you asked the question was that it's not how normally things work. I actually think that's exactly how things work in wholesale, which is wholesale prices generally go up and it happens in all industries. It may not have been that way in music in the past, but it is how it works in 99% of industries. So we're just trying to align with the way the world works.\nBryan Castellani: And Ben, I would chime in just on the overall subscription streaming growth. Again, the backdrop is healthy. We continue to see those catalysts, whether in subscriber growth, pricing optimization as well as share. And our view is that subscribers, there's been 70 million to 80 million new subs brought into the ecosystem a year of late. We continue to see that being the vast driver. Take that as 70%, if not more with, as Robert said, the glide path on pricing is, I would say, modest. And to the extent wholesale gains are ahead, those would provide upside to that. And then, of course, on share, we're pleased on the progress we've made and we have momentum with '24 releases, and overall roster and catalog and that carrying into '25. So again, encouraged there about all the underlying trends, which we think have upside to the extent pricing optimizes sooner.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Thank you guys. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi. Your line is now open.\nJason Bazinet: Your commentary is helpful and bullish, I guess, in terms of subscriber growth and potential trends on wholesale pricing and potentially market share. I just wanted to ask, how likely do you think it might be that there's a headwind embedded in those three tailwinds you talked about just from geographic mix, meaning the sub-growth comes from more emerging markets as opposed to developed markets? Is that a risk that you think investors should be focused on or do you not really think that could present itself as a headwind? Thanks.\nRobert Kyncl: So I won't answer what you should do. I'll just tell you what I do. And then\u2026\nJason Bazinet: Okay.\nRobert Kyncl: I think you guys extrapolate from that. I -- so, I study the video industry a lot, right, whether it's MVPDs, right TV film, cable, satellite television or subscription video on demand, SVOD, right, because they're extremely adjacent to what we do. And simply studying the penetrations, I kind of like take two markets, two extremely opposite markets, right, United States and India. So one is the largest market in revenue, the other one is the largest market in users in the world, right, and, but low ARPU, obviously. United States, today penetrations are around 30%, but television is around 50% as far as approaching 50%, with lots of different subscription services, obviously, investing and growing. So there is a lot more to grow in the United States for music. And by the way, we're a lower-priced product that gives you everything and it's like extremely fluid and easy. So I view it that way. And then in the -- yeah, I almost don't want to call it emerging markets because they're really high-growth markets. But the penetration there is extremely low today. And obviously, ARPU is low, but what we will see over there is we're betting on countries that have forward -- a, have higher GDPs now, but also have movements in GDPs up in the future, because higher GDP will translate into more ad revenue and it's because that's a function of GDP, and it will translate into better conversion rates in subscriptions. So in India, it's an extremely low number of subscribers today in total, I think, it's about 15 million. And on television, there's more than 100 million households in India. So there's a lot of room to grow. And so, I kind of look at those two book-ends, and then there's obviously gradation in between by market, then we just study each of those markets. So this is what's giving us confidence.\nJason Bazinet: That's super helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Benjamin Black with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nBenjamin Black: Great. Thank you for taking my questions. So, last year, a couple of DSPs moved to an artist-centric model. I'm just curious if you could give us an update on how that impacted your streaming growth. And I guess relatedly, do you think they're doing enough? What else could they do? And what about the other larger DSPs? Why haven't all adopted an artist-centric model at this point? And then, just a follow-up to -- you mentioned a large discount embedded in these offerings. I guess in a similar vein to Ben's earlier question, in your Spotify renewal, is this something that you're addressing -- have you been able to accelerate progress here? Thank you.\nRobert Kyncl: Sure. So let me just quickly comment on the second. I can't comment on any of our discussions with our partners. So that would not be fair to anyone, whether you're on the call or to our partners. So I'll decline that. But on the audio-centric model, we're very consistent from day one even before it started in saying that it is an important initiative. It's -- we're glad that we have a foot in the door on that. And it's something that we obviously have to continually rollout and not keep it static, that it has to keep on evolving with the growing scale of the industry, right? So I don't view this as a one-and-done. I view this as one-and-done isn't put in the door and then you start expanding it. And but doing it together with our partners, obviously, right? So this is a collaborative effort. So I think the -- you will continue to see impact from it every single year that will be increasing. But it's hard to, like forward forecast exactly what that is, right, because it's obviously coordination across multiple different distribution partners at the same time and it's never easy, but it is exactly what we're working on. It is the right thing for artists and songwriters. And they understand it, they appreciate it. And our partners also think it's a good idea. So it's just finding the right balance for all of us.\nBenjamin Black: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Karnovsky with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.\nDavid Karnovsky: Thank you. Just on ad-supported status streaming, wanted to see if you could speak to trends there just stripping out the impact of renewals or items like premium video with Meta. How should we kind of think about this line going forward? And then, Bryan, thanks for the multiyear outlook on margins, just kind of bringing it to '25. I don't know if you can kind of walk through specific drivers or any phasing we could think through the year? Thanks.\nBryan Castellani: Sure. On the ad-supported, the underlying traditional, what I shouldn't say is traditional ad-supported, because again, it's streaming and digital advertising, which is the right sector to be in. That continues to see some of the macro trends you've seen across others. We see that kind of your low mid-single-digits at the moment. The emerging within ad-supported, as we had said it earlier, we are lapping our TikTok deal and also we have done our Meta renewal, which we're pleased with. We were -- that underlying deal continues to grow and expand. As you know, they exited the premium music video licensing. And so, generally, the underlying core advertising there is stable and growing. The second part of your question on margin for '25, we continue to be committed to 100 basis points a year over a multiyear period. There's always going to be quarter-to-quarter timing where whether the timing of releases and marketing, how savings, and when they're redeployed. But generally, we continue to see this opportunity as our business shifts more and more digital and streaming and it's diversified around the world by artists, genres and so forth that, that continues to be a driver of our margin growth.\nDavid Karnovsky: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Devin Brisco with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nDevin Brisco: Superfan tiers have been a hot topic this year, and I think everyone is anxiously awaiting what that product launch will look like. Are there any details you can share about the potential features and monetization avenues you'd like to see introduced in that product launch? Is that tier something you expect all the DSPs to have potentially globally, maybe with slightly different variations? And given that these tiers will likely have a variety of features, how should we think about how you'll get paid? Will it be similar to existing tiers today, sort of a rev split model based on engagement, where there be a la carte revenue streams on top of that? Anything you could share on that would be appreciated?\nBryan Castellani: Sure. Can I just clarify quickly, I -- it cut off a little bit in the beginning. Were you asking about Music Pro?\nDevin Brisco: I was asking about -- sorry, I was asking about superfan tiers and what you'd like to see in that product and the opportunity there. Thanks.\nBryan Castellani: Sure. So I'll -- again, it's a little bit tough for me to answer on behalf of the retailer. It is ultimately their platform and their features. Obviously, we have to work together, but I know they decline to answer it specifically, and so I can't do that on their behalf. But the -- in general, if you think about music today, it is monetized exactly the same way, whether you're a superfan or whether you're not, right, on subscription streaming. So it's, obviously, an undervalued or it's an underexploited opportunity for all of us. And it's -- if you look at the gaming industry, 80% of revenue comes from 20% of users. There are all these obvious dynamics, but that's more of a transactional model, right, rather than a subscription model. So I think adding features that drive engagement, give people higher quality, more interactions, all of that, like learning from the gaming industry is a really good place to go. And I really don't want to comment on behalf of our partners about their features. But we're engaged in all the conversations deeply. We're bullish about it. We think it's a great opportunity both for the retailers, sorry -- for DSPs, as well as for us. And it's yet another one of those catalysts of increased growth that none of us has figured into our business.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Heaney with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nJames Heaney: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Could you just talk about the drivers of the high single-digit growth in subscription streaming on a multiyear basis? What gives you that conviction? And how much of that is coming from ARPU versus subscription? Thank you.\nBryan Castellani: Yeah. I'll go back to those three catalysts that it is subscribers, price and share. And on subscribers, as I said, we continue to see rising penetrations around the world. I think you have roughly maybe a third of penetration in developed markets that projected to go to almost half by the end of the decade. In emerging markets were massive populations, you're in the mid to maybe high-single-digits, going to low to mid-double-digits over the next four or five years. So those continue to be a vast majority of what we see as the growth driver over the multiyear period that subscriber growth. Having said that, there's -- I think, modest assumptions in industry projections for pricing. We see opportunity there on catalysts, whether it is from things like audience segmentation and superfans and raising ARPU across DSPs, as well as wholesale pricing optimization, as Robert talked about the improving on the family plan and multiuser discounts as well as the per subscriber minimums and trying to move the industry more progressively on the wholesale side. And knowing full well that in many of these bundles, music, as we like to say is an anchor tenant driving high engagement. And then on share, again, we -- the changes we have made, we think improve our volume, velocity, diversity of artists development as well as our continuing to scour the market as we always do for bolt-on acquisitions, whether those are IP catalog or can help us on the digital side in terms of quickening our initiatives. So a few things there that give us the optimism over the multiyear period for the high-single-digit subscription growth.\nJames Heaney: That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Batya Levi with UBS. Your line is now open.\nBatya Levi: Great. Thank you. Just following up on the multiyear high-single-digit growth in subscription revenue growth. Can you just maybe talk a little bit more specifically for '25? Should we expect a slower growth in the first-half of the year and maybe improvement in the back half as you lap the price increases? And maybe just cadence on artist releases, do you expect a more linear year similar to last year? Thank you.\nBryan Castellani: Batya, thanks. I think what you'll see is certainly, there's always going to be quarter-to-quarter changes there, but we do expect '25 to be comparable on the subscription side, just given the drivers and yes, we are lapping some of those price increases. So we will see some moderation. But again, we think the overall marketplace and the subscriber growth will continue -- they continue to lift the subscription growth.\nRobert Kyncl: And let me take the answer on the releases. I mean, there's a lot in the hopper from Codeplay, Rose, Linkin Park, Charli XCX, Little Zever, CK, Mary J. Blige, Zach Bryan, [Indiscernible], that could keep going. So there's a lot that we have in the pipeline. Obviously, things can move around across quarters, but one of my big areas of focus is top of the funnel on our pipeline, whether it's deals on the distribution side or releases and making sure that there is enough volume in our pipes to allow for movements back and forth between different quarters. And obviously, when that's combined with creative success on the charts, which we have had it translates into results.\nBatya Levi: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nStephen Laszczyk: Hey. Great. Thank you. Two, if I could. First for Robert, on newer forms of music monetization maybe away from social media or short-form video, I'm curious if you see any opportunity for other categories to come into the picture over the next year or two that might be able to move the needle on emerging revenue, streaming revenue growth? And then for Bryan on free cash flow conversion, just curious if there's any puts or takes worth calling out as we think about operating or free cash flow conversion heading into next year. Thank you.\nRobert Kyncl: Yes. So thanks, Stephen. So one, I'll answer this a little bit more broadly, which is music always -- music is the most widely distributed medium of any kind, more than video, more than text, more than anything. And because of that, it becomes a soundtrack to everyone's lives. And because of that, it deserves -- it always finds a way for next new revenue stream. So your question is 100% spot on. The question is how often those come and how successful they become. I have two to three new revenue streams sketched out, but nothing that I would be prepared to speak about publicly because that would be a little bit premature. But it is exciting to actually see when you look at the engagement of people around the world with music, when you see lots of different distribution partners that we have, when we have a lot of label partners distributing through us, lots of artists, there are many different opportunities to monetize than we do today, but there's nothing that we can offer in terms of specific just yet. But your question is so spot on because it always does happen in music. And so I am allocating some portion of my time to developing these things as well.\nBryan Castellani: And on the free cash flow conversion, we continue to see on a full-year basis, 50% to 60% operating cash flow conversion there. Obviously, there is some seasonality in our year just based on the timing of deals as well as payments. But otherwise, we see it largely consistent year-to-year.\nStephen Laszczyk: Great. Thank you both.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Ehrlich with Bank of America Securities. Your line is now open.\nJessica Reif Ehrlich: Thank you. I guess one follow-up and one question. On the wholesale pricing, obviously, it's a very important piece of the financials. Are you looking for -- I know you're looking for price increases, but I'm not sure I heard you say anything about structural changes. So if you could comment on that. And then also, you've made a lot of tech investments since you've come to the company, Robert. Can you kind of -- can you talk about like-kind of what you've seen from those investments, and what where we'll see it in the results and then what's left to go?\nRobert Kyncl: Sure. Sounds good. So on the first one on the wholesale prices -- so if you think about it, all of the conversations in the past have translated -- have really been done through our retail pricing. So you have wholesalers like us talking about retail pricing, and I just don't think that's right. We're wholesalers, therefore, we should talk about wholesale prices. Whatever happens with retail prices is not what we control, and therefore, like that is not how we should think about the business. So I'm very much focused on the things that we control and we learn from other industries know-how they work. So if you look at the television industry, Jessica, you're obviously extremely familiar with how retail pricing works, and it's obviously similar in many other different industries. So that's why you see us talk about wholesale -- talking about wholesale rather than retail. And on the technology investments, the over the last 12 to 18 months, we focused on fixing a lot of legacy infrastructure issues that we had in the company and we've stabilized and upgraded a lot of our core systems, which were burdened by a significant amount of technology debt. So we focused a lot on things like royalty processing systems for publishing or royalty statements for clients, sync licensing systems that allow us to drive more revenue and look into the black boxes, and obviously, our digital supply and infrastructure. So there's a lot of foundational investments that we made. And now as I said in my opening remarks, now the team is able to start focusing much more offensively on driving growth and efficiencies.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Robert Kyncl for closing remarks.\nRobert Kyncl: All right. So thank you, everyone. Thanks for your engagement, all of your questions, which were great. We are -- I said one thing in my opening remarks that it's really exhilarating to see the creative engines of Warner Records and Atlantic coming at the same time. We are up 10 percentage points in market share in Top 200 on Global Spotify charts, since the time that I started as a company. And it's just great to see this continual improvement in relevance, creating hits, creating stars, and having two large engine -- twin engines of growth in the biggest market in the world coming. And that doesn't mean that we're resting on our laurels. We continue to invest and we continue to look in work, look at further efficiencies so that we can keep on delivering on what we said, which is our margin improvement and at the same time, increasing our growth into the future. So thank you so much for your support, for your attention, and look forward to talking to you in the future.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Robert Kyncl",
            "content": "Thanks, Kareem, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased with our progress, both this quarter and this year, as we've demonstrated our strength and adaptability in a highly competitive market. Today, I'll provide more context on how we're positioning the company for sustained growth and to deliver even greater value for our artists, songwriters, and shareholders. First, let me give you a quick summary of our Q4 results. These are normalized for all previously disclosed non-recurring items. We delivered an 11% jump in Recorded Music subscription streaming revenue, driven by strong releases and assisted by global subscriber growth and price increases. This was our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Total revenue was up 6% with Recorded Music up 6%, and Music Publishing up 5%. And adjusted OIBDA grew 14% with margin increasing 150 basis points. Our robust Q4 results contributed to full-year revenue and adjusted OIBDA growth of 7% and 11%, respectively. The year was highlighted by recorded music subscription streaming growth of 12%. Our strategy is designed to enhance our ability to attract original artists and songwriters at every stage of their development. We help them realize their musical visions, cut through the noise, build sustainable careers, and grow passionate and loyal fan bases. This year, we've reimagined our organization based on the principle that simplicity and focus drive higher intensity and impact. We've done a lot of important work, which has set us up for success today and will help us grow more profitably in the future. We strengthened our presence in the US, the world's largest music market. We've shifted to a simpler and flatter organization structure to create faster and more direct channels for local talent to reach the global stage. And we preorganized key business lines such as catalog and distribution in order to deliver greater global reach. We continue to find ways to strengthen the coordination across our Recorded Music and Music Publishing divisions and we fixed a lot of foundational infrastructure issues that will now enable our technology team to be more offensively focused. I'd like to dive a little deeper into these changes and tell you about some of the further steps we've taken this quarter. In the U.S., we have two flagship record label groups, Atlantic and Warner Records, important twin engines for growth. As part of our structural changes, we elevated Elliot Grainge to lead Atlantic. While this kind of transition is never easy, this was a seamlessly executed handover. The team has delivered first-class results for priority projects while bringing in fresh ideas, onboarding dynamic executives, and attracting exciting new artists. With a digitally native approach, the Atlantic team will expand and diversify our artist roster and increase the volume of releases. While all of this is going on, the label has kicked off our new fiscal year with a bang, APT, the collaboration between Korean Superstar Rose, who we signed just a few months ago, and Bruno Mars immediately shouted to number one on the Spotify and Billboard Global charts. With this absolutely massive headline, Rose is the first female K-pop solo artist to break into Top 10 on Billboard Hot 100. Bruno Mars is the biggest artist in the world. He has the largest reach of anyone with 130 million monthly listeners on Spotify. This week, he holds two top positions on the Billboard Global 200 chart with APT and Die With a Smile, his Grammy-nominated collaboration with Lady Gaga. Other Atlantic successes include Coldplay landing their first number one album in a decade in the US, new albums from Don Toliver and The Marias, both of which continued to build strongly months after their release, and the impactful remix of Charli XCX's BRAT album and her seven Grammy nominations, including Album of the Year and Record of the Year. At the same time, the Atlantic team is bringing through the next generation of talent. Artemas reached 1 billion streams with his smashes I Like the Way You Kiss Me. Forrest Frank and Jordan Adetunji received their first Grammy nominations. Jazz artist Shazil sand songwriter Sam Barber and rapper Honcho are taking off. And competitive new signings include Fash for the World and 1900. Elliot and his team have an impressive ability to discover extraordinary talent across multiple genres and find fresh ways to help both established and emerging artists stand out from the crowd. At Warner Records, the team's commitment to artist development is driving hits and creating superstars. Under the leadership of Aaron Bay-Schuck and Tom Corson, the label's market share hit a new peak this year, reaching the number three position in the U.S. for current releases. They're hoping the likes of Teddy Swims, Benson Boone and Ali Chapa and Zach Bryan have worldwide smashes with real staying power. For example, Teddy's number one single, Loose Control, has spent an impressive 44 weeks in the Top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100. And Ali Chapa's carrier streams crossed the $9 billion mark at the right old age of 22. And it's great to see that label mates Teddy and Benson are up for best new artists at the Grammys. At the same time, Warner Records has been integral to the successful resurgence of icons like Green Day, Cher and Linkin Park, who have triumphantly returned with their first album in seven years. The first since the tragic death of lead singer Chester Bennington. The band's new album, From Zero, had the most in pre-says on WMG history, while the band embarked on a massive global tour. As I've said many times, the power of new releases drives engagement runs artist catalog and vice versa. We created a virtual cycle of consumption that views an uplift across the artists' entire body of work. For example, when Linkin Park's new single The Emptiness Machine dropped in September, and the band's new album was announced, their streams jumped by 0.5 billion compared to the same quarter last year. I cannot stress enough how exhilarating it is to watch the creative success that both Warner Records and Atlantic are having. Through our shift to a flatter organizational structure, we've elevated our regional leadership across Latin America, EMEA and APAC. This has created faster, more direct channels for local talent to access the global stage. This quarter, we continued to take steps that expand our presence in both mature and high-growth markets. In Japan, the second largest music market, we appointed a new leadership duo, CEO, Takeshi Okada; and Chairman, Kenji Kitatani. In Korea, we launched MPLIFY, a new label focused on English language music. In Benelux, we bought a leading India label Cloud 9 Recordings. In Africa, we completed our acquisition of Africori, the region's leading distribution company. And Warner Music Latina joined forces with India label Street Mob Records, an incubator of new Mexican talent. Our focus on bringing a wider array of local talent to stardom is paying off. We have vibrant music from homegrown heroes topping charts in many territories. We've had number one singles and albums by the likes of Soprano in France, Speed in Australia, Ayliva in Germany, Bien in Kenya, [Indiscernible] in Italy, Wu in Vietnam and King in India. We've also helped our global superstars reach new heights around the world. For example, Dua Lipa became the first female artist to have two albums exceed 13 billion streams each on Spotify. Before we move on, I'd like to spotlight the territory we believe has huge global potential. With a population of 1.4 billion, India is more like a continent than a country. It has the 5th largest GDP, but it's still only the 14th largest music market in the world. That gap will continue to close in the coming years. And as it does, India will become an increasingly influential global force in the music business. The country has already seen a significant increase in paid subscribers, which have increased by almost 40% since last year, but it still has less than 2% penetration. A few weeks ago, I visited our offices in India and met with our team, artists and partners, and it was very inspiring. Since launching there in 2020, we partnered with the most important local players as well as buying stakes in, and acquiring outright local music companies such as E-Positive, Divo and Global Music Junction. Earlier this month, we made our latest move on buying a stake in SkillBox, a leading ticketing and live events platform. We're helping Indian stars like Diljit Dosanjh and King reach new audiences, while building loyal Indian fan bases of global talent such as Coldplay and Dua Lipa, for both touring there in the coming months. As a result, we've seen an impressive revenue growth by over 100% in fiscal 2024. And most importantly, everything we're doing means we're well-positioned to keep taking market share as India continues its explosive growth. In our catalog and distribution divisions, we've made changes that better align our expertise and resources with the growing global opportunities for artists where previously, we were operating on a country-by-country basis, now we've globalized our operations. Our dedicated centrally managed global teams enable us to share learnings, leverage best practices, and deploy technology to find efficient ways of having greater worldwide impact. Turning to Music Publishing, the business continues to deliver impressive results. The 14% growth in total revenue on a normalized basis for the full year represents our fourth consecutive year of double-digit revenue growth. This was led by 19% streaming growth on a normalized basis. We're contributing to global hits, strengthening our services and monetizing deeper into our catalog. Here are a few recent high points. Three of the five Grammy nominees for Songwriter of the Year are Warner Chappell writers. Amy Allen, RAYE and Jessi Alexander. Warner Chappell is number two for a second consecutive quarter on Billboard's top radio airplay rankings and rising to number two on the Hot 100 songs chart with 25% market share. And Warner Chappell is number one on the German half-year charts with its writers spending 18 of 26 weeks at number one on the sales chart. Despite all this success, we are investing on our laurels and we've continued to invest into our future growth by forging new partnerships with Analog Metaverse, the company founded by Grammy award-winning producer Salaam Remi, launching a venture with the widely respected British dance label Defected Records, and appointing new leadership in high growth territories such as Lisa Li in China and Sophia Hong in Korea. We're very optimistic about the future at Warner Music Group. We have the right team and strategy to deliver long-term profitable growth in a dynamic and thriving industry. We continue to build strong mutually beneficial relationships with our partners to grow the value of music. With penetration in mature markets expected to increase from approximately 35% today to nearly 50% by 2030, and emerging markets going from single to low double-digits over the same timeframe, music subscriber growth should remain healthy for the years to come. For reference, in the U.S., cable TV penetration is a little over 50%, and the swap penetration is approaching 50%. Highlighting that even in a mature market, music penetration is very low and has plenty of runway ahead. With both subscriber growth and opportunities for wholesale price increases, the formula for streaming growth is strong and there is plenty of room for acceleration. Our focus on efficiency has freed up capital, enabling us to increase our investments in growth opportunities. As we previously promised, we've increased our A&R investment by approximately 11% in fiscal 2024, as we continue to sign new artists and songwriters and acquire IP and catalogs, all while driving our digital transformation. As part of our investment strategy, we will consider bolt-on acquisitions that accelerate our progress, while meeting our return thresholds. In addition to these investment opportunities, I wanted to note that our Board has authorized a share repurchase program of up to $100 million. The program demonstrates our confidence in the value of our company and our optimism for the path ahead. Our confidence is underpinned by the strong momentum we're carrying into 2025 with an exciting release slate that includes projects from Rose, Dua Lipa, Teddy Swims, Jack Harlow, Benson Boone, Myke Towers, David Guetta, Burna Boy, FKA twigs and more. We're excited by the opportunities ahead and look forward to delivering more culture-shaping music in 2025 and beyond. And now over to you, Brian. Sure. Thank you. Thanks for the question. So I see this in two different buckets. Bucket number one is the obvious moves. And in those, I'm focused on two big ones, which is reduction of discounts in family plans and more frequent PSM escalators. So it's very simple. It comes down to these two levers, and they're very obvious moves for the industry for a company like WMG, and they are not a zero-sum move between us and the DSPs, they can actually be in concert with each other. And then the second bucket is in more innovations and that's where sort of a superfan tier like the Music Pro that's been discussed a lot, or other SKUs, some which may include ads and sort of just innovation around SKUs, and audience segmentation. Those are also potential upsides for all of us. My focus is in the order that I described, which is obvious moves first, those two specifically, and then the innovations. And all of these things would be sort of incremental to the glide path that you guys see for the industry. Sounds good. Thank you, Ben. All right. So let me start with -- I think with Elliot. So when you think about the music industry today, there are obviously lots of different independent music companies, many of whom claim to do many things really, really well. I would say you have to take everything with a great grain of salt. But one of those that surely did that was 10-K. I know that's a fact from the numbers that both they had prior and the numbers that they have delivered in the first year under the WMG umbrella, which was a phenomenal growth both on top line and bottom line. The skill set that they bring and it's not just Elliot, it's also his team. The skill set that they bring is being very digitally native. Today, the vast majority of our revenue is coming through streaming. Promotion mostly happens online. You must be digitally native if you want to succeed today and in the future in the music industry. And that is important to the DNA of the company. And they have brought that. The other part that they bring is intensity. When you start a company of that size, you start from scratch, bootstrap it. You have to be incredibly intense about everything that you do. And I love that about that. You also create strong points of view on various decisions. And I can tell you that all of these things, they touch -- developing artists, aspiring artists as well as superstars. Everybody wants to have broad reach, have hits, have loyal type fan bases and obviously they monetize it really well. But if you're somebody who is just starting, you need to build an audience. If you're a superstar, you want to keep the audience, either way, it comes to that. So this digital-first mindset from 10-K has translated really well into the company. And it also goes to their talent development. I named two artists who are, Forrest Frank and Jordan, who are for the first Grammys, and it's amazing to see that. So that's one. At the same time, you have to be really great at working well in a larger organization like WMG, which means you have to have a flexible mindset and work well with others. And Elliot does that incredibly well. So I'm really, really pleased with how things are going. On your wholesale question, I think the way you asked the question was that it's not how normally things work. I actually think that's exactly how things work in wholesale, which is wholesale prices generally go up and it happens in all industries. It may not have been that way in music in the past, but it is how it works in 99% of industries. So we're just trying to align with the way the world works. So I won't answer what you should do. I'll just tell you what I do. And then... I think you guys extrapolate from that. I -- so, I study the video industry a lot, right, whether it's MVPDs, right TV film, cable, satellite television or subscription video on demand, SVOD, right, because they're extremely adjacent to what we do. And simply studying the penetrations, I kind of like take two markets, two extremely opposite markets, right, United States and India. So one is the largest market in revenue, the other one is the largest market in users in the world, right, and, but low ARPU, obviously. United States, today penetrations are around 30%, but television is around 50% as far as approaching 50%, with lots of different subscription services, obviously, investing and growing. So there is a lot more to grow in the United States for music. And by the way, we're a lower-priced product that gives you everything and it's like extremely fluid and easy. So I view it that way. And then in the -- yeah, I almost don't want to call it emerging markets because they're really high-growth markets. But the penetration there is extremely low today. And obviously, ARPU is low, but what we will see over there is we're betting on countries that have forward -- a, have higher GDPs now, but also have movements in GDPs up in the future, because higher GDP will translate into more ad revenue and it's because that's a function of GDP, and it will translate into better conversion rates in subscriptions. So in India, it's an extremely low number of subscribers today in total, I think, it's about 15 million. And on television, there's more than 100 million households in India. So there's a lot of room to grow. And so, I kind of look at those two book-ends, and then there's obviously gradation in between by market, then we just study each of those markets. So this is what's giving us confidence. Sure. So let me just quickly comment on the second. I can't comment on any of our discussions with our partners. So that would not be fair to anyone, whether you're on the call or to our partners. So I'll decline that. But on the audio-centric model, we're very consistent from day one even before it started in saying that it is an important initiative. It's -- we're glad that we have a foot in the door on that. And it's something that we obviously have to continually rollout and not keep it static, that it has to keep on evolving with the growing scale of the industry, right? So I don't view this as a one-and-done. I view this as one-and-done isn't put in the door and then you start expanding it. And but doing it together with our partners, obviously, right? So this is a collaborative effort. So I think the -- you will continue to see impact from it every single year that will be increasing. But it's hard to, like forward forecast exactly what that is, right, because it's obviously coordination across multiple different distribution partners at the same time and it's never easy, but it is exactly what we're working on. It is the right thing for artists and songwriters. And they understand it, they appreciate it. And our partners also think it's a good idea. So it's just finding the right balance for all of us. And let me take the answer on the releases. I mean, there's a lot in the hopper from Codeplay, Rose, Linkin Park, Charli XCX, Little Zever, CK, Mary J. Blige, Zach Bryan, [Indiscernible], that could keep going. So there's a lot that we have in the pipeline. Obviously, things can move around across quarters, but one of my big areas of focus is top of the funnel on our pipeline, whether it's deals on the distribution side or releases and making sure that there is enough volume in our pipes to allow for movements back and forth between different quarters. And obviously, when that's combined with creative success on the charts, which we have had it translates into results. Yes. So thanks, Stephen. So one, I'll answer this a little bit more broadly, which is music always -- music is the most widely distributed medium of any kind, more than video, more than text, more than anything. And because of that, it becomes a soundtrack to everyone's lives. And because of that, it deserves -- it always finds a way for next new revenue stream. So your question is 100% spot on. The question is how often those come and how successful they become. I have two to three new revenue streams sketched out, but nothing that I would be prepared to speak about publicly because that would be a little bit premature. But it is exciting to actually see when you look at the engagement of people around the world with music, when you see lots of different distribution partners that we have, when we have a lot of label partners distributing through us, lots of artists, there are many different opportunities to monetize than we do today, but there's nothing that we can offer in terms of specific just yet. But your question is so spot on because it always does happen in music. And so I am allocating some portion of my time to developing these things as well. Sure. Sounds good. So on the first one on the wholesale prices -- so if you think about it, all of the conversations in the past have translated -- have really been done through our retail pricing. So you have wholesalers like us talking about retail pricing, and I just don't think that's right. We're wholesalers, therefore, we should talk about wholesale prices. Whatever happens with retail prices is not what we control, and therefore, like that is not how we should think about the business. So I'm very much focused on the things that we control and we learn from other industries know-how they work. So if you look at the television industry, Jessica, you're obviously extremely familiar with how retail pricing works, and it's obviously similar in many other different industries. So that's why you see us talk about wholesale -- talking about wholesale rather than retail. And on the technology investments, the over the last 12 to 18 months, we focused on fixing a lot of legacy infrastructure issues that we had in the company and we've stabilized and upgraded a lot of our core systems, which were burdened by a significant amount of technology debt. So we focused a lot on things like royalty processing systems for publishing or royalty statements for clients, sync licensing systems that allow us to drive more revenue and look into the black boxes, and obviously, our digital supply and infrastructure. So there's a lot of foundational investments that we made. And now as I said in my opening remarks, now the team is able to start focusing much more offensively on driving growth and efficiencies. All right. So thank you, everyone. Thanks for your engagement, all of your questions, which were great. We are -- I said one thing in my opening remarks that it's really exhilarating to see the creative engines of Warner Records and Atlantic coming at the same time. We are up 10 percentage points in market share in Top 200 on Global Spotify charts, since the time that I started as a company. And it's just great to see this continual improvement in relevance, creating hits, creating stars, and having two large engine -- twin engines of growth in the biggest market in the world coming. And that doesn't mean that we're resting on our laurels. We continue to invest and we continue to look in work, look at further efficiencies so that we can keep on delivering on what we said, which is our margin improvement and at the same time, increasing our growth into the future. So thank you so much for your support, for your attention, and look forward to talking to you in the future."

            "content": "Thank you, Robert, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into our results, I want to remind everyone that growth rate comparisons will be in constant currency and where appropriate, I will reference normalized growth metrics. There are items throughout the quarter and the year that affect comparability. The details and adjustments relating to these items can be found in our earnings press release. In Q4, total revenue grew 3%, and adjusted OIBDA increased 11% with a margin of 21.7%, an increase of 170 basis points over the prior-year quarter. On a normalized basis, total revenue grew 6%, adjusted OIBDA increased 14%, and margin increased 150 basis points. Recorded Music revenue increased 4%, and grew 6% on a normalized basis, led by subscription streaming, which grew 11%, our fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Ad support streaming declined by 6%, as we lapped last year's TikTok renewal and saw the revenue impact of Meta's exit from premium music videos. Physical revenue increased 5%, driven by strong releases in the U.S. and Japan, while artist services and expanded rights revenue increased 3%, primarily due to higher concert promotion revenue in Japan. Licensing revenue increased 33%, driven by increased revenue from copyright infringement settlements, primarily in the U.S. and growth in broadcast use. Recorded Music adjusted OIBDA increased 13% with a margin of 23.7%, an increase of 200 basis points. On a normalized basis, adjusted OIBDA increased 14%, and margin increased 160 basis points. Our Music Publishing results reflect the $17 million benefit from the CRB rate increase in the prior year quarter, adjusted for that benefit, Music Publishing total revenue increased 5% while Digital increased 6%, and Streaming increased 5%. These growth rates compared against the prior-year quarter, which saw robust streaming growth of 17%, and reflect continued market and catalog growth as well as timing of payments. Sync revenue increased 15%, reflecting an increase in copyright infringement settlements, primarily in the U.S., while performance revenue decreased 2%. Mechanical revenue decreased 12% due to lower physical sales and timing of distributions. Music Publishing adjusted OIBDA grew 11% with a margin of 28.1%, an increase of 290 basis points. On a normalized basis, adjusted OIBDA increased 17% and margin increased 280 basis points. For the full year, total company revenue grew 7%, and adjusted OIBDA grew 16% with a margin of 22.3%, an increase of 180 basis points. On a normalized basis, total revenue grew 7%, and adjusted OIBDA grew 11% with a margin of 21.4%. Adjusted OIBDA margin increased 70 basis points as strong operating performance and savings from our restructuring programs were partially offset by increased investment in A&R as well as revenue mix. Recorded Music revenue increased 6%, and adjusted OIBDA grew 17% with margin expansion of 240 basis points. On a normalized basis, Recorded Music revenue increased 6% with adjusted OIBDA growth of 11%, and margin expansion of 110 basis points. These results reflect streaming revenue growth of 10%, led by strength in subscription streaming, which grew 12%. Music Publishing revenue and adjusted OIBDA both increased 11%. On a normalized basis, Music Publishing revenue increased 14%, and adjusted OIBDA increased 13%. Q4 operating cash flow decreased 10% to $304 million from $338 million in the prior year quarter. The decrease was primarily driven by timing of working capital items, partially offset by the timing of severance payments. Free cash flow decreased 10% to $271 million from $300 million in the prior year quarter. For the full-year, operating cash flow increased 10% to $754 million and free cash flow increased 14% to $638 million. Operating cash flow conversion was 53% of adjusted OIBDA for the full year, in line with our target of 50% to 60% despite increased investment in A&R and shifts in deal timing. As of September 30th, we had a cash balance of $694 million, total debt of $4 billion, and net debt of $3.3 billion. Our weighted average cost of debt was 4.3% and our nearest maturity date remains 2028. We continue to actively manage and improve our capital structure, most recently repricing our term loan in September, which has led to continued improvements in our debt ratings with both S&P and Fitch assigning us investment grade ratings in August and September, respectively. I'd like to reiterate that as a result of actions taken in Q4 to reorganize our Recorded Music business, we now expect our restructuring plan to generate pre-tax cost savings of $260 million and we continue to expect a significant majority of these savings to be achieved by the end of fiscal 2025. Looking ahead, our strong Q4 momentum in 2024 is carrying into 2025. Subscription streaming continues to see healthy underlying trends and we expect high single-digit growth for fiscal 2025 on a multi-year basis. Additionally, our goal remains to deliver margin expansion of 100 basis points and operating cash flow conversion of 50% to 60% of adjusted OIBDA on a multi-year basis. As a reminder, there are a number of previously disclosed items that will impact comparability in Q1. Streaming growth will be impacted by the BMG digital distribution roll-off, the digital license renewal in the prior year, and the lapping of Spotify price increases. Our digital distribution relationship with BMG that was planned to roll off by the end of fiscal '24 will now continue into fiscal '25. The revenue impact in Q1 is approximately $16 million versus the prior year quarter. And the digital license renewal with one of our international partners was $27 million in the prior year quarter. Our physical distribution relationship with BMG has largely rolled off. We expect there to be an unfavorable revenue impact of $15 million to $20 million in Q1. Licensing revenue will reflect the $68 million catalog licensing agreement extension we disclosed in Q1 \u201824. Finally, Artist services revenue will reflect the exit of our owned and operated media properties, which contributed $20 million in the prior year quarter. The music industry remains healthy and we continue to see positive subscriber growth and penetration trends as well as opportunities for wholesale pricing growth. We are excited about the slate this year and look forward to delivering great music. The momentum in the business is strong and we are positioning ourselves for long-term success. Thank you for joining us today. We'll now open the call for questions. And Ben, I would chime in just on the overall subscription streaming growth. Again, the backdrop is healthy. We continue to see those catalysts, whether in subscriber growth, pricing optimization as well as share. And our view is that subscribers, there's been 70 million to 80 million new subs brought into the ecosystem a year of late. We continue to see that being the vast driver. Take that as 70%, if not more with, as Robert said, the glide path on pricing is, I would say, modest. And to the extent wholesale gains are ahead, those would provide upside to that. And then, of course, on share, we're pleased on the progress we've made and we have momentum with '24 releases, and overall roster and catalog and that carrying into '25. So again, encouraged there about all the underlying trends, which we think have upside to the extent pricing optimizes sooner. Sure. On the ad-supported, the underlying traditional, what I shouldn't say is traditional ad-supported, because again, it's streaming and digital advertising, which is the right sector to be in. That continues to see some of the macro trends you've seen across others. We see that kind of your low mid-single-digits at the moment. The emerging within ad-supported, as we had said it earlier, we are lapping our TikTok deal and also we have done our Meta renewal, which we're pleased with. We were -- that underlying deal continues to grow and expand. As you know, they exited the premium music video licensing. And so, generally, the underlying core advertising there is stable and growing. The second part of your question on margin for '25, we continue to be committed to 100 basis points a year over a multiyear period. There's always going to be quarter-to-quarter timing where whether the timing of releases and marketing, how savings, and when they're redeployed. But generally, we continue to see this opportunity as our business shifts more and more digital and streaming and it's diversified around the world by artists, genres and so forth that, that continues to be a driver of our margin growth. Sure. Can I just clarify quickly, I -- it cut off a little bit in the beginning. Were you asking about Music Pro? Sure. So I'll -- again, it's a little bit tough for me to answer on behalf of the retailer. It is ultimately their platform and their features. Obviously, we have to work together, but I know they decline to answer it specifically, and so I can't do that on their behalf. But the -- in general, if you think about music today, it is monetized exactly the same way, whether you're a superfan or whether you're not, right, on subscription streaming. So it's, obviously, an undervalued or it's an underexploited opportunity for all of us. And it's -- if you look at the gaming industry, 80% of revenue comes from 20% of users. There are all these obvious dynamics, but that's more of a transactional model, right, rather than a subscription model. So I think adding features that drive engagement, give people higher quality, more interactions, all of that, like learning from the gaming industry is a really good place to go. And I really don't want to comment on behalf of our partners about their features. But we're engaged in all the conversations deeply. We're bullish about it. We think it's a great opportunity both for the retailers, sorry -- for DSPs, as well as for us. And it's yet another one of those catalysts of increased growth that none of us has figured into our business. Yeah. I'll go back to those three catalysts that it is subscribers, price and share. And on subscribers, as I said, we continue to see rising penetrations around the world. I think you have roughly maybe a third of penetration in developed markets that projected to go to almost half by the end of the decade. In emerging markets were massive populations, you're in the mid to maybe high-single-digits, going to low to mid-double-digits over the next four or five years. So those continue to be a vast majority of what we see as the growth driver over the multiyear period that subscriber growth. Having said that, there's -- I think, modest assumptions in industry projections for pricing. We see opportunity there on catalysts, whether it is from things like audience segmentation and superfans and raising ARPU across DSPs, as well as wholesale pricing optimization, as Robert talked about the improving on the family plan and multiuser discounts as well as the per subscriber minimums and trying to move the industry more progressively on the wholesale side. And knowing full well that in many of these bundles, music, as we like to say is an anchor tenant driving high engagement. And then on share, again, we -- the changes we have made, we think improve our volume, velocity, diversity of artists development as well as our continuing to scour the market as we always do for bolt-on acquisitions, whether those are IP catalog or can help us on the digital side in terms of quickening our initiatives. So a few things there that give us the optimism over the multiyear period for the high-single-digit subscription growth. Batya, thanks. I think what you'll see is certainly, there's always going to be quarter-to-quarter changes there, but we do expect '25 to be comparable on the subscription side, just given the drivers and yes, we are lapping some of those price increases. So we will see some moderation. But again, we think the overall marketplace and the subscriber growth will continue -- they continue to lift the subscription growth. And on the free cash flow conversion, we continue to see on a full-year basis, 50% to 60% operating cash flow conversion there. Obviously, there is some seasonality in our year just based on the timing of deals as well as payments. But otherwise, we see it largely consistent year-to-year."

At the request of Warner Music Group, today's call is being recorded for replay purposes, and if you object, you may disconnect at any time. Now I'd like to turn today's call over to your host, Mr. Kareem Chin, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nKareem Chin: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Warner Music Group's fiscal third quarter earnings conference call. Please note that our earnings press release, earnings snapshot and Form 10-Q are available on our website. On today's call, we have our CEO, Robert Kyncl; and our CFO, Bryan Castellani, who will take you through our results, and then we will answer your questions. Before our prepared remarks, I would like to refer you to the second slide of the earnings snapshot to remind you that this communication involves forward-looking statements that reflect the current views of Warner Music Group about future events and financial performance. We plan to present certain non-GAAP results during this conference call and in our earnings snapshot slides and have provided schedules reconciling these results to our GAAP results in our earnings press release. All of these materials are posted on our website. Also, please note that all revenue figures and comparisons discussed today will be presented in constant currency, unless otherwise noted. References to normalized revenue and adjusted OIBDA are adjusted for items that impact comparability. The details of these can be found in our filings. All forward-looking statements are made as of today, and we disclaim any duty to update such statements. Our expectations, beliefs and projections are expressed in good faith, and we believe there's a reasonable basis for them. However, there can be no assurance that management's expectations, beliefs and projections will result or be achieved. Investors should not rely on forward-looking statements because they are subject to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors that can cause actual results that differ materially from our expectations. Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in our filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll turn it over to Robert.\nRobert Kyncl: Thanks, Kareem. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our commitment to our artists and songwriters has been bearing fruit, and I'm very pleased with the work our team is doing from signing and developing great talent, to strengthening our global presence to improving efficiency to drive the business forward. Let's turn to Q3 results. Subscription streaming was strong accelerating to 14% on a normalized basis, driven by improved performance as well as subscriber growth and price increases. This impressive performance was offset by the effects of a softer ad market and challenging comparisons in both artist services and physical revenue. As a result, Q3 total revenue increased 1%, with recorded music decreasing 1% and music publishing increasing 9%. On a normalized basis, total revenue grew 3% with recorded music up 1% and music publishing up 12%. Total adjusted OIBDA increased 8% with margin growth of 130 basis points. On a normalized basis, total adjusted OIBDA grew 10% with margin increasing 120 basis points. As you may have seen, last week, we announced organizational changes in our recorded music business. Before I go into further detail on this, I'd like to thank Max Lousada for his exceptional contributions to this company over the past two decades, especially for his last seven years as our recorded music CEO. A first-class leader, he's been instrumental in building the WMG of today and creating a strong foundation for our future. He's agreed to stay on until the end of our fiscal year on September 30, and after that, he'll remain an adviser through the end of January. Our reorganization will help us achieve three important things: one, we'll have new flatter structure that will elevate our creative regional leadership, setting up more direct channels between local expertise and global opportunities. We have a deep bench of executives. Going forward, we'll be organized into four major regions in recorded music, each overseen by a talented leader who will report directly to me. Two, we'll be compounding our strength in the United States, the world's biggest music market by organizing our frontline labels into two groups: Warner Records which is on an incredible run with chart-topping orders such as Zach Bryan and Benson Boone will expand its responsibilities to oversee Warner Music Nashville. Atlantic Music Group which already includes Atlantic Records and 300 Elektra Entertainment will now also encompass the recently acquired 10K Projects. At the same time, there will be changes at the top of Atlantic Music Group. Julie Greenwald is beginning a leadership transition. She will take on a new role as Chairman with Elliot Grainge coming in as CEO. We're excited by the prospect of taking Atlantic's culture making capabilities and adding Elliott's digitally native approach into the mix as we grow the label's outstanding reputation. And three, we'll be strengthening our central operations in order to maximize our worldwide impact and provide operating leverage across the entire organization. As a result, the Heads of Global Catalog, Marketing, WMX and ADA will directly report to me. When you take these three things together, I am confident that over time will become both more effective and more efficient in how we serve our artists. Today, music moves at the speed of light. Our new structure better reflects the fast-moving nature of cultural trends. We'll nurture audits through our local expertise while plugging them into a big powerful platform that will amplify their success globally. We're making changes from a position of strength, and I'm happy to say that we're firing on all cylinders across new releases, catalog, distribution and publishing. For decades, one of the hallmarks of WMG's success has been our focus on artist development, building careers from the ground up from Aretha Franklin, Led Zeppelin and Madonna to more recent superstars like Ed Sheeran, Bruno Mars and Dua Lipa. Each of them is a homegrown WMG artist. And this remains true today. So far, in 2024, WMG has more new artists debuting on the Spotify Global Top 10 than any other music company. And many of them are homegrown successes signed very early in their careers. Including Artemas, Benson Boone, Teddy Swims and many others. Meanwhile, our recent successes include blockbuster albums from Megan Thee Stallion and Gunna, who both went #1 in the U.S.; Dua Lipa, who reached #1 in numerous countries, including the U.K., Spain and France, Zach Bryan, who topped multiple billboard charts, including the top streaming album chart and Charlie XCX, when we signed in 2010. Her sixth studio album, Brat has received rave reviews and spawned rap culture. The pop sensation of the summer with many influencers, celebrities and even politicians joining in. Globally, we've had dozens of massive hits across multiple regions, including Capo Plaza, Baby Gang and Rose Villain in Italy, SCH and Soprano in France; Myke Towers in Mexico and Spain and Charlie Xiao [ph] in China and TitoM, Yuppe and Burna Boy in Nigeria. The beauty of streaming is that newly released hits have a halo effect on the rest of an artist catalog. As we help artists develop loyal fan bases, each new hit drives an uptick in their catalog. And when we amplify and extend that halo effect, it builds the stickiness that transforms hits into evergreen deep catalog. As one example, Twenty One Pilots released their latest Album Clancy. It more than doubled the streams across the bands entire body of work that week. We continue to reinvigorate our entire catalog, which extends back over seven decades and includes legendary artists such as the Eagles, Fleetwood Mac, Prince, Joni Mitchell, Ray Charles, The Doors and Tracy Chapman, among many others. Turning to distribution. ADA, which serves independent audits and labels has been generating solid momentum this year. We launched ADA over 30 years ago and in the streaming universe where scale is especially important. It plays a key role in our recorded music ecosystem. Recent developments include a global distribution deal with regional Mexican label, Elegante Records and a partnership with Brazil's Sua M\u00fasica. In Music Publishing, Warner Chappell's impressive run continues and we're seeing an increasing number of artists who want to partner with us across both recorded and publishing rates. There is power in having a unified global team supporting every aspect of their careers and catalogs, and it's true for everyone from legends like David Bowie and Tom Petty to current stars like Teddy Swims and Lizzo. Our amazing songwriters continue to contribute to huge hits, including I Had Some Help by Post Malone, featuring Morgan Wallen and Shaboozey's A Bar Song Tipsy, both of which hit #1 on Billboard Hot 100. Amy Allen is also on a spectacular hot streak as she corrodes Sabrina Carpenter, Summer Smash, Please Please and Espresso. A powerful example of our ecosystem in action is Benson Boone, the breakout star of the year who signed with us for both recorded music and Publishing. Benson was first discovered by Warner Chappell, who work closely with him to hone his songwriter skills. He later joined Warner Records before he had even released a single record, supported by a targeted strategic artist development plan, his Single Beautiful Things, became a global smash, topping the charts in over a dozen countries and holding the #1 spot on the billboard Global 200 Chart 7 weeks. It was also the first record released in 2024 to hit 1 billion streams, keeping it in the top 10 of the billboard half 100 for '24 of the last 27 weeks. Benson, like all of our newer artists and songwriters, is already beginning to grow this catalog of tomorrow, demonstrating how we can help turn dreams into careers and build lasting value in partnership with genuine talent. As we look forward, we're excited about the future of the music industry and our horizon for WMG. I know that investor attention has recently been focused on the dynamics between the labels and the DSPs with some speculating that were adversaries playing a zero-sum game. That's simply not the case. We're actively engaged with our partners around ways to drive growth for all of us. Streaming dynamics remain healthy with plenty of headroom for subscriber growth in both established and emerging markets across multiple partners. Also, price optimization and improvements in the royalty models will provide ongoing opportunities for additional growth. On the AI front, as I told you last quarter, I testified at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in April on the needs for Deepfake legislation. I'm grateful to Senators, Coons, Blackburn, Klobuchar and Tillis for their thoughtful crafting of the NO FAKES Act, which was introduced in the U.S. Senate last week. This act strikes the right balance between propelling the next wave of technology powered creativity while safeguarding every Americans right to control the use of their own image and voice in the age of AI. We're closing the year with great new music coming from Coldplay, David Guetta, Benson Boone, Myke Towers, [indiscernible] and many others. It's been a transformative year for WMG and the entire industry, and there's lots to be optimistic about. Now here is Bryan.\nBryan Castellani: Thank you, Robert, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into details of our Q3 results, I want to remind everyone that growth rate comparisons will be in constant currency and where appropriate, I will reference normalized growth metrics. The items affecting recorded music streaming revenue comparability include the previously disclosed BMG digital revenue roll-off, which was $25 million unfavorable in the quarter and the renewal with one of our international digital partners, which was $3 million unfavorable this quarter. Additionally, the CRB rate increase provided a $7 million benefit to music publishing digital revenue in the prior year quarter. In Q3, total revenue grew 1%, and adjusted OIBDA increased 8% with a margin of 20.3%, an increase of 130 basis points over the prior year quarter. On a normalized basis, total revenue grew 3% and adjusted OIBDA increased 10%. Recorded Music revenue declined 1% and grew 1% on a normalized basis as strength in streaming was offset by lower physical and artist services revenue. On a normalized basis, streaming revenue grew 10%, with subscription streaming growth accelerating to 14% while ad-supported revenue increased 1%. The improvement in subscription growth was driven by subscriber growth and price increases. The deceleration in ad supported revenue was driven by a challenging comparison to the prior year quarter. Physical revenue decreased 4% due to the timing of releases and strong U.S. physical releases in the prior year quarter. Artist Services and Expanded Rights revenue decreased 26% due to lower merchandising revenue, lower concert promotion revenue in Japan and France and foregone revenue related to the previously announced exit from our owned and operated media properties. Licensing revenue decreased 1% driven by increased revenue from copyright infringement settlements in the prior year quarter. Recorded music adjusted OIBDA increased 8% with a margin of 22.5%, an increase of 190 basis points. On a normalized basis, adjusted OIBDA increased 9% and margin increased 160 basis points. Music Publishing continues to deliver strong results with revenue growth of 9% or 12% on a normalized basis, driven by streaming, performance and sync revenue. Digital revenue increased by 7% or 11% on a normalized basis. Streaming revenue increased by 8% or 12% on a normalized basis reflecting continued market growth, continued investment in and the expansion of our catalog and timing of payments. Performance revenue increased by 33% due to an increase in touring activity outside the U.S. and an increase in U.S. radio airplay. Sync revenue increased 2% driven by timing of copyright infringement settlements. Mechanical revenue decreased 19% due to lower physical sales. Music Publishing adjusted OIBDA grew 8% with a margin of 26.2%, an increase of 10 basis points. On a normalized basis, adjusted OIBDA increased 11%, margin increased 20 basis points. Total operating cash flow increased 29% to $188 million from $146 million in the prior year quarter. Operating cash flow conversion was 59% of adjusted OIBDA. We remain on pace to achieve our 50% to 60% multiyear target for the full-year. Free cash flow increased 42% to $160 million from $113 million in the prior year quarter, driven by strong operating performance and timing of working capital. As of June 30, we had a cash balance of $607 million, total debt of $4 billion and net debt of $3.4 billion. Our weighted average cost of debt was 4.5% and our nearest maturity date remain 2028. As we look ahead, we continue to estimate the roll-off from BMG digital distribution will be in the range of $25 million to $30 million in Q4. Looking at Q4, we see continued strength in subscription streaming revenue, while an ad-supported revenue, we expect challenging comparisons to the prior year quarter. As we approach the two-year anniversary of our existing Meta deal, we want to flag that they will no longer be making available premium music videos to their users. This change to Meta's offering will result in a revenue impact of approximately $10 million per quarter across both recorded music and music publishing, which will start to impact us in Q4. We continue to be excited about the portfolio of emerging streaming platforms and expect this category to be a driver of long-term growth. We are focused on delivering a strong close to the year, and I'm pleased that Q4 is off to a solid start. While macro challenges in the ad market persists, the health of the industry remains strong with multiple vectors for growth, and we continue to position ourselves for long-term success. We look forward to delivering exciting new music in the quarters to come. Thank you for joining us today. We'll now open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Kutgun Maral with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nKutgun Maral: Good morning and thank you for taking the questions. Two, if I could. First on subscription streaming. Some of your peers have called out pressure points on the streaming outlook as it relates to a slowdown in subscriber growth at certain DSPs. I know you've touched on a number of opportunities for the industry and WMG and called out continued strength into Q4. But is there any more you can share on the trends you're seeing at recorded music subscription streaming and the outlook ahead? And second, on the recorded music reorg, it's sometimes hard for us on the outside to appreciate the implications of these decisions and how it might impact the business. Robert, you called out a number of items that you hope to achieve to ultimately become more effective and efficient in the ways that you serve artists. I know it's early days, but any thoughts on how these moves might impact the financials over the coming years? Thank you.\nRobert Kyncl: Thank you for the question. I appreciate it and good morning. So first, on the streaming market. The demand side of our business is very resilient and very strong. And I think other industries would wish for that kind of demand to continue. Two, we're not seeing any change in our revenue mix. So I'd like to -- we have always cautioned the financial community to make sure that you don't look to just one company, Spotify namely as the proxy for the entire industry because it's much more diversified and we're not seeing any change in what's been happening and in our revenue mix. And three, I am very encouraged and deeply engaged together, obviously, with our teams, with our DSP partners around four things to drive growth. First one is obviously the continued growth between emerging and established markets and taking different approaches within those. Two on price optimization, which includes family plans and various pricing increases, which you've obviously seen play out over the last year or so, and we'll continue to. Three, the evolution of royalty models, how the pie is divided. And four, we're on the precipice of audience segmentation with adding nonmusic contents to the music offering and through that, improving the underlying subscriber acquisition and retention metrics, which drive the overall business forward, which has obviously played out really well in many other industries. So overall, I'm very bullish on streaming for all of these reasons, and we're leaning into it as hard as we can, together with our DSP partners. On the reorg, I'll repeat the three things, which is flatter organizational structure allows us to really lean into the global nature of the business which has accelerated overall. And there are only a handful of companies in the world that can do what we do, which is have an infrastructure in all these growing emerging markets and international not just emerging in all markets around the world. And unleashed trade routes of content exchange effectively and have the infrastructure to take local stars and make global stars out of them. And that's a very unique and a difficult thing to do and only a handful of companies can execute on that. So our flat organizational structure elevates that local creative leadership team; two, we're compounding our strength in the U.S. by consolidating Warner Records, Warner Nashville into Warner Records and 10K into Atlantic. So simplifying the organization and then three, centralizing several functions for operating leverage. As to the financial impact of it, this is a strategic decision, not a cost-saving exercise. And so therefore, it's far too early to speak to any impact of it, but it's strategic to set us up incredibly well for the future market today.\nBryan Castellani: Kutgun, it's Bryan, and Robert took the words out of my mouth on the second part of that. But on the first part of that, just to reiterate what we believe is the health resiliency and growth of the industry, we continue to see pretty consistent growth across our handful of top DSPs and certainly led by subscriber growth and that rising tide, but as well as price to a lesser extent, and underpinned by, as Robert pointed to a number of new releases and carryover from prior ones that a strong slate gave us momentum in this quarter.\nKutgun Maral: Very helpful. Thank you both.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Cameron Mansson-Perrone with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nCameron Mansson-Perrone: Thanks. Good morning guys. Two if I can. One, just on DSP pricing over time. I think historically, you've talked about wanting to facilitate different strategies and approaches across your distribution partners. But if we start to enter a world where there's a meaningful divergence across DSPs in terms of how well they're monetizing streaming users, how does that impact your approach or mentality. And then obviously, a couple of lawsuits against Suno and Udio. Any update on how you're thinking about the risks and opportunities around those technologies? And maybe just how you see the relationship between content owners and generative or IP owners and generative AI businesses developing over time? Thanks.\nRobert Kyncl: Sounds good. Thanks, Cameron. So on the divergence between approaches between the different ESPs. I think generally diversity is good. I know you're using the word divergence and I use diversity, but it really means the diversity of approaches. And because from that, you learn what works, what doesn't. And when you have strong demand side of the business, for people where something may not work, they adjust and go for the thing that does work as long as there is a strong demands in the industry, because people obviously chase growth. So I'm not worried about that. I will come in and experimentation is good and sometimes you win and sometimes you lose. But you have to focus on the long-term and drive growth and experimentation at all times. On GenAI risks and opportunities. So one, I'll just repeat our -- what I said maybe a year ago or a few quarters ago, I'll repeat sort of our prioritization of how we think about the stakeholders in this space. There are three. One, the platforms where content is consumed. And that's really our current DSP partners, because whatever GenAI content has created somewhere else, we'll end up in the places where people used to listening, YouTube, Spotify, et cetera, all of our partners. Two, then it's the Generative AI engines, right? You mentioned some of them; and then three is the government. I have them in that order because that is the picking order of AI, at least from our standpoint. You have to start with the consumption will take place. And there are some partners who are both in the platform business as well as in the GenAI business. YouTube is a good example of that. Meta is a good example of that, et cetera. So of course, those are the partners where we focus first and foremost, because we can have the most thoughtful approaches on how we solve it for the future. Obviously, we're making great progress with regulation and government. We're not alone. It's obviously entire content industry and they're varying approaches. But you can see a lot more alignment within the music industry, but also within the content industry it's coming to fruition. And so I'm actually quite optimistic about this. And you touched on Suno and Udio. Obviously, we have -- there's a lawsuit that's been filed. There's nothing new to report on that. So we're waiting for the next step on that. But we're very, very focused on this. Well religiously defend our IP, our artists, and songwriters name and likeness and because it is the right thing to do, and it is a good business to do.\nCameron Mansson-Perrone: That's really helpful. Thanks.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Batya Levi with UBS. Your line is open.\nBatya Levi: Great. Thank you. Can you confirm if you had any -- if you lapped any price increases in fiscal 3Q and how we should think about the upcoming roll-offs? And maybe just on the recent price increase that we saw from Spotify for bundled services. Can you talk about if you think you'd be able to participate in some of that increase?\nBryan Castellani: Batya, hey it's Bryan. Thanks. On the price increases, we're at the end of lapping the YouTube. We still have a bit of lapping of Spotify and those are really, I would say the biggest. But there are geographic and certainly tier mixes around the world that can influence it as well?\nRobert Kyncl: Yes. And I'll take the second one. So as you know, there are many different SKUs already in existence between the various family plans and duals, et cetera. And we've never disclosed how we participate in any of those. So we obviously don't plan to change that going forward. But I can tell you that any assumption that key anchor tenants such as us, would not participate is not -- it's not the best assumption to put in mind.\nBatya Levi: Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Stephen Laszczyk with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nStephen Laszczyk: Hey, great. Thanks. Two, if I could. First, maybe on the release slate. Robert, you talked a little bit about your expectations for the upcoming slate into the back half of the year. I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on that. It feels like some artists who are releasing albums later this year might have some deeper catalogs. You might have the potential to move the needle on market share a little bit. Just curious if you would agree with that? And then on emerging streaming, I appreciate the meta deal and the headwinds from premium video, but just curious if you could update us on how you're thinking about the opportunities for incremental growth across some of the emerging streaming IP rights holders just the opportunity there in general of the next year to more broadly? Thank you.\nRobert Kyncl: All right. Thanks, Stephen. So first, I want to say -- I know the question is about new release slate. But I feel that we actually consistently don't do justice to our catalog on the earnings costs that we talked about. We focus on one thing only. Yes, we have an incredibly strong release slate for Q4 and going forward. But I really want to also say that our -- the performance of our catalog is strong and continues to be strong. And obviously, a lot of it is also if it's Shallow Catalog uplifted by the performance of new releases, but it's the strength of our company is on a combination of three cohorts. New releases, Shallow Catalog and Deep Catalog. And it's really -- it's great to see it all firing on all cylinders. To specifically answer your question, we have music coming from Coldplay, David Guetta, Benson Boone, Myke Towers, [indiscernible] and many, many others. So there's a lot, lot coming out. We're incredibly busy and the team is doing a phenomenal job shipping the slate. On the emerging streamers. It's a very -- this is one of the great things about music that we are incredibly relevant to all generations. And one of the reasons is that we're deeply embedded into platforms, whether they have long-form content, short fall content or completely bite-sized content. And all of those markets continue to grow. We're working really hard on our relationships with them and make sure that we're growing with them and that we experiment and do lots of innovative things that help drive the business forward, not just for us but also for them. So I'm excited about it. And every day, I just kind of wake up and say, amazing that music is so relevant across all types of mediums, whether short or long or medium size. And we obviously have to do our job to make sure that we monetize it the right way and bring it all to a robust growth rate on the whole.\nBryan Castellani: Stephen, it's Bryan. I'll add to that, and I called out the Meta in my commentary as we come upon our anniversary of that they have changed their offering and moved away from premium music video licensing. Having said that, our underlying relationship with Meta is strong, growing. There is real and Instagram that also are growing well. And so we remain excited about the category. And like last year, we had our TikTok step-up. So we also have that. But the category continues to be a growth category.\nStephen Laszczyk: Great. Thank you both.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Omar Mejias with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nOmar Mejias: Hey guys. Thank you for taking the question. Maybe first on subscription streaming growth was very strong during the quarter and accelerated sequentially. Can you unpack some of the drivers of the sequential acceleration as it relates to sub growth pricing and more importantly, some internal actions that you guys have taken to drive our catalog. Maybe along those lines on just the overall health of the industry, and based on the underlying trends you guys seen. Are you seeing -- or do you have a changing view to the total addressable market for the industry over the long term?\nRobert Kyncl: All right. Let me -- thank you Omar. So on subscription streaming, let me make sure I understood the question correctly. Was it what were the underlying drivers of that growth? Was that correct? I just wanted to make sure I got it.\nBryan Castellani: So our subscription streaming strengthen it was 14 up a couple of tenths or a few from last quarter. And obviously, that's underpinned by sub growth, which, again, we continue to see pretty consistent across the top DSPs still some impact to a lesser extent on price. And again, our carryover slate last quarter as well as additional releases this quarter help support it. And so that's what really drove it. And then on the health of the industry, I would just say we're at a place where penetration of music subscriptions are still really low. I think they're overall about 15% and there's a lot of headroom there to go from 700 million to 800 million subscriptions today to well over $1 billion over the next five years. And as Robert has talked earlier and we've spoken about, there's still more sophistication and optimization to be done on price as well as audience and product segmentation or innovation. So still optimistic about it, Omar.\nRobert Kyncl: Let me take the catalog optimization question. There's two ways to think about it. One, which is sort of a super high touch marketing campaigns that you do for select titles, right, that have high impact that our team executes on incredibly well. And then the second one is sort of at-scale optimization of the entire catalog and making sure that it's set up correctly on all DSPs to effectively work really well within the algorithms for recommendations, which drive growth. So we have like two different approaches, and we continue to push on both at the same time.\nOmar Mejias: Thank you guys.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. Your line is open.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Thank you. Maybe just drilling into the subscription streaming trends a little bit more. As you're probably aware, when your competitors obviously reported different numbers, and they called out a few headwinds in terms of industry growth between different DSPs diverging to some extent. Maybe you could just talk about what you're seeing broadly across the landscape. I mean it seems like there's a big market share shift towards Spotify away from the others. And if you expect that to impact our growth trends as well going forward. And there's been some commentary again from your peers with respect to maybe some social media platforms looking at their content at least specifically. So if you could talk about what's going on broadly in the landscape and why that convergence that would be the detail. Thank you.\nRobert Kyncl: Thank you. So again, I'll sort of repeat, which is we're not seeing any change from what we've been saying before. We don't have a different -- we don't have a change in our revenue mix. And I would say that's probably our sort of strongest answer on that point. So I'm not -- I can't really comment about our competitors. I don't see inside their business and what the drivers of their performance is. We're pleased with the progress that our DSP partners are making. As I forget, somebody mentioned in the question was there's divergence and approaches, which I view as positive because people are experimenting different ways. And again, sometimes they work out, sometimes they don't, but people adjust and they continue as long as there is a strong demand side of the business, which there is and I think that's underpinned by sort of this interplay between the emerging platforms and the sort of music services, because all of those are effectively elevating the role of music and the relevance of music in today's world, because it is more relevant than it's ever been before. It's more ever present. And it's between both the bite-size consumption within the emerging platforms as well as the full consumption within the streaming platforms. And all of that forms an incredibly strong ecosystem for us to play in. And we obviously have to do our job to grow our share both in catalog and new releases and also grow the overall time together with our DSP partners.\nKannan Venkateshwar: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Tim Nollen with Macquarie. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, this is Ross on for Tim. Robert, some of the industry have expressed dissatisfaction with the ad-supported tier at some DSPs given they don't sufficiently monetize the value of music that artist produced. I'd be interested in getting some of your thoughts on what role you think the ad-supported tier should take. And if windowing should apply, i.e., shouldn't only be available to pre uses after a week or so. How many levers do you have to time in order to influence the optimization of music here? Thanks.\nRobert Kyncl: So one, I don't have an opinion on windowing today. I think that's a very -- it's much more detailed topic to really think through together with our partners. But I do have a strong opinion on advertising in general, which is -- if you think about the advertising market that music effectively plays in, it is the advertising market that you want to be in, i.e., it's addressable, it's on mobile devices, it's on tablets, it's on computers and it's on TV screens. It's not linear advertising that is not effectively targeted. And you see the shift from sort of traditional advertising to, obviously, all the digital platforms that deliver all the things that I mentioned. And that is really where our product is exposed. So I think we are in the correct advertising market. That's number one. Number two, obviously, advertising market fluctuates with GDP. So basically, marketing budgets are a function of GDP. And GDP growth. So they fluctuate with those a little bit more than subscriptions. That's okay. It's just a fact of life. But we're swimming in the right river. So let's start with that. Two, I think your question is, is there too much content in there? And is it impacting subscriptions, et cetera. I think in order to grow subscriptions, it is helpful to have a healthy funnel. Now the question is, what does healthy mean? And these are the experimentations that I was talking about that. If we want to change something in the future, it has to be done in concert together with our DSP partners that would drive the overall growth, like focusing on driving growth and driving ARPU and driving both of those in unison can only be done if you, you can do one without the other, and you cannot do experimentation in subscription only without experimenting in ad-supported and it just has to be done together with our partners. So nothing new to report on that today, but I'm glad we're spending in the right river.\nUnidentified Analyst: Right. Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from Rich Greenfield with LightShed Partners.\nRichard Greenfield: Thanks for taking the question. Robert, given your experience at Google and YouTube, they were really the first to bundle when you think about YouTube Premium, which includes music versus just the YouTube music service. And I'm sort of curious how you think about what that meant for the music business at Google. How we can think about how that translates over time to Spotify as they look to bundle? And then sort of a separate question, but there's a lot of speculation in the marketplace about Apple launching advertising as part of Apple TV Plus. Wondering they've never done an ad-supported music service. Clearly, Spotify has shown the power of that funnel to drive people to sort of go the freemium model. Just curious whether you think Apple might move in that direction, seeing Spotify success and how willing you are to have others in the marketplace using advertising in a freemium-like model? Thanks.\nRobert Kyncl: Thank you, Richard. All right. So [indiscernible] in on my past experience, I really forgot all of it. I'm kidding. It was very helpful, both for YouTube as well as for the music industry. I remember when we started, we had 5 million subscribers I'm like, Oh, how are we going to make it to 20 million, right? And now it's north of 100 million. And it was a big ride, but we created a unique offering in the market that was not replicated by anyone else, and it works for that company, right? And that's -- this is what I talk about when I -- this is what I mean when I say I am happy to see divergence and approaches, because companies should play to their own strengths. What makes them unique and what is the offering that they can do that others can do that drives the business forward. And that's what we did at YouTube and the team over there executed flawlessly. And it was good for the music industry. So it takes me to the second question on Apple. I don't have anything new to share on that. But I am the most willing to experiment and drive the business forward with any of our partners. And in whatever directions as long as it's achieving strong objectives for both of us. And again, it doesn't mean that there aren't failures along the way that always comes with unless you, which unless you fall sometimes, you don't know you're pushing hard enough, but it's most willing to experiment with companies which are small with companies which are big to find all these unique offerings that can drive more growth.\nRichard Greenfield: Thanks. Appreciate it.\nOperator: And I'm not showing any further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Robert for any closing remarks.\nRobert Kyncl: Well, I want to close by saying how excited we are about the momentum that we have, the hits that we have on the board the execution of our teams going through obviously complicated things such as reorganizations and transitions. I once again want to give really heartfelt thanks to Max Lousada for his incredible contributions to the company. And to Julie, who has done an incredible job of creating culture over the last 20 years and great icons in the music industry and I appreciate both of their efforts to have a very smooth transition and making sure that our artists and songwriters are the ones who benefit the most from everything that we do. And I want to welcome Elliott to our -- to Atlantic and challenge him to build upon Julie's incredible legacy and which is -- there are big shoes to fill, and he's got a big job ahead of him. So with that, really excited about the direction of the company and the team that we have and look forward to talking to you guys in 90 days.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Robert Kyncl",
            "content": "Thanks, Kareem. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our commitment to our artists and songwriters has been bearing fruit, and I'm very pleased with the work our team is doing from signing and developing great talent, to strengthening our global presence to improving efficiency to drive the business forward. Let's turn to Q3 results. Subscription streaming was strong accelerating to 14% on a normalized basis, driven by improved performance as well as subscriber growth and price increases. This impressive performance was offset by the effects of a softer ad market and challenging comparisons in both artist services and physical revenue. As a result, Q3 total revenue increased 1%, with recorded music decreasing 1% and music publishing increasing 9%. On a normalized basis, total revenue grew 3% with recorded music up 1% and music publishing up 12%. Total adjusted OIBDA increased 8% with margin growth of 130 basis points. On a normalized basis, total adjusted OIBDA grew 10% with margin increasing 120 basis points. As you may have seen, last week, we announced organizational changes in our recorded music business. Before I go into further detail on this, I'd like to thank Max Lousada for his exceptional contributions to this company over the past two decades, especially for his last seven years as our recorded music CEO. A first-class leader, he's been instrumental in building the WMG of today and creating a strong foundation for our future. He's agreed to stay on until the end of our fiscal year on September 30, and after that, he'll remain an adviser through the end of January. Our reorganization will help us achieve three important things: one, we'll have new flatter structure that will elevate our creative regional leadership, setting up more direct channels between local expertise and global opportunities. We have a deep bench of executives. Going forward, we'll be organized into four major regions in recorded music, each overseen by a talented leader who will report directly to me. Two, we'll be compounding our strength in the United States, the world's biggest music market by organizing our frontline labels into two groups: Warner Records which is on an incredible run with chart-topping orders such as Zach Bryan and Benson Boone will expand its responsibilities to oversee Warner Music Nashville. Atlantic Music Group which already includes Atlantic Records and 300 Elektra Entertainment will now also encompass the recently acquired 10K Projects. At the same time, there will be changes at the top of Atlantic Music Group. Julie Greenwald is beginning a leadership transition. She will take on a new role as Chairman with Elliot Grainge coming in as CEO. We're excited by the prospect of taking Atlantic's culture making capabilities and adding Elliott's digitally native approach into the mix as we grow the label's outstanding reputation. And three, we'll be strengthening our central operations in order to maximize our worldwide impact and provide operating leverage across the entire organization. As a result, the Heads of Global Catalog, Marketing, WMX and ADA will directly report to me. When you take these three things together, I am confident that over time will become both more effective and more efficient in how we serve our artists. Today, music moves at the speed of light. Our new structure better reflects the fast-moving nature of cultural trends. We'll nurture audits through our local expertise while plugging them into a big powerful platform that will amplify their success globally. We're making changes from a position of strength, and I'm happy to say that we're firing on all cylinders across new releases, catalog, distribution and publishing. For decades, one of the hallmarks of WMG's success has been our focus on artist development, building careers from the ground up from Aretha Franklin, Led Zeppelin and Madonna to more recent superstars like Ed Sheeran, Bruno Mars and Dua Lipa. Each of them is a homegrown WMG artist. And this remains true today. So far, in 2024, WMG has more new artists debuting on the Spotify Global Top 10 than any other music company. And many of them are homegrown successes signed very early in their careers. Including Artemas, Benson Boone, Teddy Swims and many others. Meanwhile, our recent successes include blockbuster albums from Megan Thee Stallion and Gunna, who both went #1 in the U.S.; Dua Lipa, who reached #1 in numerous countries, including the U.K., Spain and France, Zach Bryan, who topped multiple billboard charts, including the top streaming album chart and Charlie XCX, when we signed in 2010. Her sixth studio album, Brat has received rave reviews and spawned rap culture. The pop sensation of the summer with many influencers, celebrities and even politicians joining in. Globally, we've had dozens of massive hits across multiple regions, including Capo Plaza, Baby Gang and Rose Villain in Italy, SCH and Soprano in France; Myke Towers in Mexico and Spain and Charlie Xiao [ph] in China and TitoM, Yuppe and Burna Boy in Nigeria. The beauty of streaming is that newly released hits have a halo effect on the rest of an artist catalog. As we help artists develop loyal fan bases, each new hit drives an uptick in their catalog. And when we amplify and extend that halo effect, it builds the stickiness that transforms hits into evergreen deep catalog. As one example, Twenty One Pilots released their latest Album Clancy. It more than doubled the streams across the bands entire body of work that week. We continue to reinvigorate our entire catalog, which extends back over seven decades and includes legendary artists such as the Eagles, Fleetwood Mac, Prince, Joni Mitchell, Ray Charles, The Doors and Tracy Chapman, among many others. Turning to distribution. ADA, which serves independent audits and labels has been generating solid momentum this year. We launched ADA over 30 years ago and in the streaming universe where scale is especially important. It plays a key role in our recorded music ecosystem. Recent developments include a global distribution deal with regional Mexican label, Elegante Records and a partnership with Brazil's Sua Mu\u0301sica. In Music Publishing, Warner Chappell's impressive run continues and we're seeing an increasing number of artists who want to partner with us across both recorded and publishing rates. There is power in having a unified global team supporting every aspect of their careers and catalogs, and it's true for everyone from legends like David Bowie and Tom Petty to current stars like Teddy Swims and Lizzo. Our amazing songwriters continue to contribute to huge hits, including I Had Some Help by Post Malone, featuring Morgan Wallen and Shaboozey's A Bar Song Tipsy, both of which hit #1 on Billboard Hot 100. Amy Allen is also on a spectacular hot streak as she corrodes Sabrina Carpenter, Summer Smash, Please Please and Espresso. A powerful example of our ecosystem in action is Benson Boone, the breakout star of the year who signed with us for both recorded music and Publishing. Benson was first discovered by Warner Chappell, who work closely with him to hone his songwriter skills. He later joined Warner Records before he had even released a single record, supported by a targeted strategic artist development plan, his Single Beautiful Things, became a global smash, topping the charts in over a dozen countries and holding the #1 spot on the billboard Global 200 Chart 7 weeks. It was also the first record released in 2024 to hit 1 billion streams, keeping it in the top 10 of the billboard half 100 for '24 of the last 27 weeks. Benson, like all of our newer artists and songwriters, is already beginning to grow this catalog of tomorrow, demonstrating how we can help turn dreams into careers and build lasting value in partnership with genuine talent. As we look forward, we're excited about the future of the music industry and our horizon for WMG. I know that investor attention has recently been focused on the dynamics between the labels and the DSPs with some speculating that were adversaries playing a zero-sum game. That's simply not the case. We're actively engaged with our partners around ways to drive growth for all of us. Streaming dynamics remain healthy with plenty of headroom for subscriber growth in both established and emerging markets across multiple partners. Also, price optimization and improvements in the royalty models will provide ongoing opportunities for additional growth. On the AI front, as I told you last quarter, I testified at the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in April on the needs for Deepfake legislation. I'm grateful to Senators, Coons, Blackburn, Klobuchar and Tillis for their thoughtful crafting of the NO FAKES Act, which was introduced in the U.S. Senate last week. This act strikes the right balance between propelling the next wave of technology powered creativity while safeguarding every Americans right to control the use of their own image and voice in the age of AI. We're closing the year with great new music coming from Coldplay, David Guetta, Benson Boone, Myke Towers, [indiscernible] and many others. It's been a transformative year for WMG and the entire industry, and there's lots to be optimistic about. Now here is Bryan. Thank you for the question. I appreciate it and good morning. So first, on the streaming market. The demand side of our business is very resilient and very strong. And I think other industries would wish for that kind of demand to continue. Two, we're not seeing any change in our revenue mix. So I'd like to -- we have always cautioned the financial community to make sure that you don't look to just one company, Spotify namely as the proxy for the entire industry because it's much more diversified and we're not seeing any change in what's been happening and in our revenue mix. And three, I am very encouraged and deeply engaged together, obviously, with our teams, with our DSP partners around four things to drive growth. First one is obviously the continued growth between emerging and established markets and taking different approaches within those. Two on price optimization, which includes family plans and various pricing increases, which you've obviously seen play out over the last year or so, and we'll continue to. Three, the evolution of royalty models, how the pie is divided. And four, we're on the precipice of audience segmentation with adding nonmusic contents to the music offering and through that, improving the underlying subscriber acquisition and retention metrics, which drive the overall business forward, which has obviously played out really well in many other industries. So overall, I'm very bullish on streaming for all of these reasons, and we're leaning into it as hard as we can, together with our DSP partners. On the reorg, I'll repeat the three things, which is flatter organizational structure allows us to really lean into the global nature of the business which has accelerated overall. And there are only a handful of companies in the world that can do what we do, which is have an infrastructure in all these growing emerging markets and international not just emerging in all markets around the world. And unleashed trade routes of content exchange effectively and have the infrastructure to take local stars and make global stars out of them. And that's a very unique and a difficult thing to do and only a handful of companies can execute on that. So our flat organizational structure elevates that local creative leadership team; two, we're compounding our strength in the U.S. by consolidating Warner Records, Warner Nashville into Warner Records and 10K into Atlantic. So simplifying the organization and then three, centralizing several functions for operating leverage. As to the financial impact of it, this is a strategic decision, not a cost-saving exercise. And so therefore, it's far too early to speak to any impact of it, but it's strategic to set us up incredibly well for the future market today. Sounds good. Thanks, Cameron. So on the divergence between approaches between the different ESPs. I think generally diversity is good. I know you're using the word divergence and I use diversity, but it really means the diversity of approaches. And because from that, you learn what works, what doesn't. And when you have strong demand side of the business, for people where something may not work, they adjust and go for the thing that does work as long as there is a strong demands in the industry, because people obviously chase growth. So I'm not worried about that. I will come in and experimentation is good and sometimes you win and sometimes you lose. But you have to focus on the long-term and drive growth and experimentation at all times. On GenAI risks and opportunities. So one, I'll just repeat our -- what I said maybe a year ago or a few quarters ago, I'll repeat sort of our prioritization of how we think about the stakeholders in this space. There are three. One, the platforms where content is consumed. And that's really our current DSP partners, because whatever GenAI content has created somewhere else, we'll end up in the places where people used to listening, YouTube, Spotify, et cetera, all of our partners. Two, then it's the Generative AI engines, right? You mentioned some of them; and then three is the government. I have them in that order because that is the picking order of AI, at least from our standpoint. You have to start with the consumption will take place. And there are some partners who are both in the platform business as well as in the GenAI business. YouTube is a good example of that. Meta is a good example of that, et cetera. So of course, those are the partners where we focus first and foremost, because we can have the most thoughtful approaches on how we solve it for the future. Obviously, we're making great progress with regulation and government. We're not alone. It's obviously entire content industry and they're varying approaches. But you can see a lot more alignment within the music industry, but also within the content industry it's coming to fruition. And so I'm actually quite optimistic about this. And you touched on Suno and Udio. Obviously, we have -- there's a lawsuit that's been filed. There's nothing new to report on that. So we're waiting for the next step on that. But we're very, very focused on this. Well religiously defend our IP, our artists, and songwriters name and likeness and because it is the right thing to do, and it is a good business to do. Yes. And I'll take the second one. So as you know, there are many different SKUs already in existence between the various family plans and duals, et cetera. And we've never disclosed how we participate in any of those. So we obviously don't plan to change that going forward. But I can tell you that any assumption that key anchor tenants such as us, would not participate is not -- it's not the best assumption to put in mind. All right. Thanks, Stephen. So first, I want to say -- I know the question is about new release slate. But I feel that we actually consistently don't do justice to our catalog on the earnings costs that we talked about. We focus on one thing only. Yes, we have an incredibly strong release slate for Q4 and going forward. But I really want to also say that our -- the performance of our catalog is strong and continues to be strong. And obviously, a lot of it is also if it's Shallow Catalog uplifted by the performance of new releases, but it's the strength of our company is on a combination of three cohorts. New releases, Shallow Catalog and Deep Catalog. And it's really -- it's great to see it all firing on all cylinders. To specifically answer your question, we have music coming from Coldplay, David Guetta, Benson Boone, Myke Towers, [indiscernible] and many, many others. So there's a lot, lot coming out. We're incredibly busy and the team is doing a phenomenal job shipping the slate. On the emerging streamers. It's a very -- this is one of the great things about music that we are incredibly relevant to all generations. And one of the reasons is that we're deeply embedded into platforms, whether they have long-form content, short fall content or completely bite-sized content. And all of those markets continue to grow. We're working really hard on our relationships with them and make sure that we're growing with them and that we experiment and do lots of innovative things that help drive the business forward, not just for us but also for them. So I'm excited about it. And every day, I just kind of wake up and say, amazing that music is so relevant across all types of mediums, whether short or long or medium size. And we obviously have to do our job to make sure that we monetize it the right way and bring it all to a robust growth rate on the whole. All right. Let me -- thank you Omar. So on subscription streaming, let me make sure I understood the question correctly. Was it what were the underlying drivers of that growth? Was that correct? I just wanted to make sure I got it. Let me take the catalog optimization question. There's two ways to think about it. One, which is sort of a super high touch marketing campaigns that you do for select titles, right, that have high impact that our team executes on incredibly well. And then the second one is sort of at-scale optimization of the entire catalog and making sure that it's set up correctly on all DSPs to effectively work really well within the algorithms for recommendations, which drive growth. So we have like two different approaches, and we continue to push on both at the same time. Thank you. So again, I'll sort of repeat, which is we're not seeing any change from what we've been saying before. We don't have a different -- we don't have a change in our revenue mix. And I would say that's probably our sort of strongest answer on that point. So I'm not -- I can't really comment about our competitors. I don't see inside their business and what the drivers of their performance is. We're pleased with the progress that our DSP partners are making. As I forget, somebody mentioned in the question was there's divergence and approaches, which I view as positive because people are experimenting different ways. And again, sometimes they work out, sometimes they don't, but people adjust and they continue as long as there is a strong demand side of the business, which there is and I think that's underpinned by sort of this interplay between the emerging platforms and the sort of music services, because all of those are effectively elevating the role of music and the relevance of music in today's world, because it is more relevant than it's ever been before. It's more ever present. And it's between both the bite-size consumption within the emerging platforms as well as the full consumption within the streaming platforms. And all of that forms an incredibly strong ecosystem for us to play in. And we obviously have to do our job to grow our share both in catalog and new releases and also grow the overall time together with our DSP partners. So one, I don't have an opinion on windowing today. I think that's a very -- it's much more detailed topic to really think through together with our partners. But I do have a strong opinion on advertising in general, which is -- if you think about the advertising market that music effectively plays in, it is the advertising market that you want to be in, i.e., it's addressable, it's on mobile devices, it's on tablets, it's on computers and it's on TV screens. It's not linear advertising that is not effectively targeted. And you see the shift from sort of traditional advertising to, obviously, all the digital platforms that deliver all the things that I mentioned. And that is really where our product is exposed. So I think we are in the correct advertising market. That's number one. Number two, obviously, advertising market fluctuates with GDP. So basically, marketing budgets are a function of GDP. And GDP growth. So they fluctuate with those a little bit more than subscriptions. That's okay. It's just a fact of life. But we're swimming in the right river. So let's start with that. Two, I think your question is, is there too much content in there? And is it impacting subscriptions, et cetera. I think in order to grow subscriptions, it is helpful to have a healthy funnel. Now the question is, what does healthy mean? And these are the experimentations that I was talking about that. If we want to change something in the future, it has to be done in concert together with our DSP partners that would drive the overall growth, like focusing on driving growth and driving ARPU and driving both of those in unison can only be done if you, you can do one without the other, and you cannot do experimentation in subscription only without experimenting in ad-supported and it just has to be done together with our partners. So nothing new to report on that today, but I'm glad we're spending in the right river. Thank you, Richard. All right. So [indiscernible] in on my past experience, I really forgot all of it. I'm kidding. It was very helpful, both for YouTube as well as for the music industry. I remember when we started, we had 5 million subscribers I'm like, Oh, how are we going to make it to 20 million, right? And now it's north of 100 million. And it was a big ride, but we created a unique offering in the market that was not replicated by anyone else, and it works for that company, right? And that's -- this is what I talk about when I -- this is what I mean when I say I am happy to see divergence and approaches, because companies should play to their own strengths. What makes them unique and what is the offering that they can do that others can do that drives the business forward. And that's what we did at YouTube and the team over there executed flawlessly. And it was good for the music industry. So it takes me to the second question on Apple. I don't have anything new to share on that. But I am the most willing to experiment and drive the business forward with any of our partners. And in whatever directions as long as it's achieving strong objectives for both of us. And again, it doesn't mean that there aren't failures along the way that always comes with unless you, which unless you fall sometimes, you don't know you're pushing hard enough, but it's most willing to experiment with companies which are small with companies which are big to find all these unique offerings that can drive more growth. Well, I want to close by saying how excited we are about the momentum that we have, the hits that we have on the board the execution of our teams going through obviously complicated things such as reorganizations and transitions. I once again want to give really heartfelt thanks to Max Lousada for his incredible contributions to the company. And to Julie, who has done an incredible job of creating culture over the last 20 years and great icons in the music industry and I appreciate both of their efforts to have a very smooth transition and making sure that our artists and songwriters are the ones who benefit the most from everything that we do. And I want to welcome Elliott to our -- to Atlantic and challenge him to build upon Julie's incredible legacy and which is -- there are big shoes to fill, and he's got a big job ahead of him. So with that, really excited about the direction of the company and the team that we have and look forward to talking to you guys in 90 days."

            "content": "Thank you, Robert, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into details of our Q3 results, I want to remind everyone that growth rate comparisons will be in constant currency and where appropriate, I will reference normalized growth metrics. The items affecting recorded music streaming revenue comparability include the previously disclosed BMG digital revenue roll-off, which was $25 million unfavorable in the quarter and the renewal with one of our international digital partners, which was $3 million unfavorable this quarter. Additionally, the CRB rate increase provided a $7 million benefit to music publishing digital revenue in the prior year quarter. In Q3, total revenue grew 1%, and adjusted OIBDA increased 8% with a margin of 20.3%, an increase of 130 basis points over the prior year quarter. On a normalized basis, total revenue grew 3% and adjusted OIBDA increased 10%. Recorded Music revenue declined 1% and grew 1% on a normalized basis as strength in streaming was offset by lower physical and artist services revenue. On a normalized basis, streaming revenue grew 10%, with subscription streaming growth accelerating to 14% while ad-supported revenue increased 1%. The improvement in subscription growth was driven by subscriber growth and price increases. The deceleration in ad supported revenue was driven by a challenging comparison to the prior year quarter. Physical revenue decreased 4% due to the timing of releases and strong U.S. physical releases in the prior year quarter. Artist Services and Expanded Rights revenue decreased 26% due to lower merchandising revenue, lower concert promotion revenue in Japan and France and foregone revenue related to the previously announced exit from our owned and operated media properties. Licensing revenue decreased 1% driven by increased revenue from copyright infringement settlements in the prior year quarter. Recorded music adjusted OIBDA increased 8% with a margin of 22.5%, an increase of 190 basis points. On a normalized basis, adjusted OIBDA increased 9% and margin increased 160 basis points. Music Publishing continues to deliver strong results with revenue growth of 9% or 12% on a normalized basis, driven by streaming, performance and sync revenue. Digital revenue increased by 7% or 11% on a normalized basis. Streaming revenue increased by 8% or 12% on a normalized basis reflecting continued market growth, continued investment in and the expansion of our catalog and timing of payments. Performance revenue increased by 33% due to an increase in touring activity outside the U.S. and an increase in U.S. radio airplay. Sync revenue increased 2% driven by timing of copyright infringement settlements. Mechanical revenue decreased 19% due to lower physical sales. Music Publishing adjusted OIBDA grew 8% with a margin of 26.2%, an increase of 10 basis points. On a normalized basis, adjusted OIBDA increased 11%, margin increased 20 basis points. Total operating cash flow increased 29% to $188 million from $146 million in the prior year quarter. Operating cash flow conversion was 59% of adjusted OIBDA. We remain on pace to achieve our 50% to 60% multiyear target for the full-year. Free cash flow increased 42% to $160 million from $113 million in the prior year quarter, driven by strong operating performance and timing of working capital. As of June 30, we had a cash balance of $607 million, total debt of $4 billion and net debt of $3.4 billion. Our weighted average cost of debt was 4.5% and our nearest maturity date remain 2028. As we look ahead, we continue to estimate the roll-off from BMG digital distribution will be in the range of $25 million to $30 million in Q4. Looking at Q4, we see continued strength in subscription streaming revenue, while an ad-supported revenue, we expect challenging comparisons to the prior year quarter. As we approach the two-year anniversary of our existing Meta deal, we want to flag that they will no longer be making available premium music videos to their users. This change to Meta's offering will result in a revenue impact of approximately $10 million per quarter across both recorded music and music publishing, which will start to impact us in Q4. We continue to be excited about the portfolio of emerging streaming platforms and expect this category to be a driver of long-term growth. We are focused on delivering a strong close to the year, and I'm pleased that Q4 is off to a solid start. While macro challenges in the ad market persists, the health of the industry remains strong with multiple vectors for growth, and we continue to position ourselves for long-term success. We look forward to delivering exciting new music in the quarters to come. Thank you for joining us today. We'll now open the call for questions. Kutgun, it's Bryan, and Robert took the words out of my mouth on the second part of that. But on the first part of that, just to reiterate what we believe is the health resiliency and growth of the industry, we continue to see pretty consistent growth across our handful of top DSPs and certainly led by subscriber growth and that rising tide, but as well as price to a lesser extent, and underpinned by, as Robert pointed to a number of new releases and carryover from prior ones that a strong slate gave us momentum in this quarter. Batya, hey it's Bryan. Thanks. On the price increases, we're at the end of lapping the YouTube. We still have a bit of lapping of Spotify and those are really, I would say the biggest. But there are geographic and certainly tier mixes around the world that can influence it as well? Stephen, it's Bryan. I'll add to that, and I called out the Meta in my commentary as we come upon our anniversary of that they have changed their offering and moved away from premium music video licensing. Having said that, our underlying relationship with Meta is strong, growing. There is real and Instagram that also are growing well. And so we remain excited about the category. And like last year, we had our TikTok step-up. So we also have that. But the category continues to be a growth category. So our subscription streaming strengthen it was 14 up a couple of tenths or a few from last quarter. And obviously, that's underpinned by sub growth, which, again, we continue to see pretty consistent across the top DSPs still some impact to a lesser extent on price. And again, our carryover slate last quarter as well as additional releases this quarter help support it. And so that's what really drove it. And then on the health of the industry, I would just say we're at a place where penetration of music subscriptions are still really low. I think they're overall about 15% and there's a lot of headroom there to go from 700 million to 800 million subscriptions today to well over $1 billion over the next five years. And as Robert has talked earlier and we've spoken about, there's still more sophistication and optimization to be done on price as well as audience and product segmentation or innovation. So still optimistic about it, Omar."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome to Warner Music Group's Second Quarter Earnings Call for the period ended March 31, 2024. At the request of Warner Music Group, today's call is being recorded for replay purposes and if you object, you may disconnect at any time. Now I would like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Kareem Chin. Head of Investor Relations. Please, you may begin. \nKareem Chin: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Warner Music Group's Fiscal Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Please note that our earnings press release, earnings snapshot and Form 10-Q are available on our website. On today's call, we have our CEO, Robert Kyncl; and our CFO, Bryan Castellani, who will take you through our results, and then we will answer your questions.\n Before our prepared remarks, I'd like to refer you to the second slide of the earnings snapshot to remind you that this communication involves forward-looking statements that reflect the current views of Warner Music Group about future events and financial performance. We plan to present certain non-GAAP results during this conference call and in our earnings snapshot slides and have provided schedules reconciling these results to our GAAP results in our earnings press release. All of these materials are posted on our website.\n Also, please note that all revenue figures and comparisons discussed today will be presented in constant currency, unless otherwise noted. Our references to normalized revenue and adjusted OIBDA are adjusted for items that impact comparability. The details of these can be found in our filings. All forward-looking statements are made as of today, and we disclaim any duty to update such statements. Our expectations, beliefs and projections are expressed in good faith, and we believe there is a reasonable basis for them. However, there can be no assurance that management's expectations, beliefs and projections will result or be achieved.\n Investors should not rely on forward-looking statements because they are subject to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors that can cause actual results that differ materially from our expectations. Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements is contained in our filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll turn it over to Robert. \nRobert Kyncl: Thanks, Kareem. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I am pleased with everything our global team is doing to deliver for our artists and songwriters and drive our business forward.\n In Q2, total revenue increased 7% with Recorded Music and Music Publishing increasing 4% and 19%, respectively. On a normalized basis, total revenue grew 9% with Recorded Music up 7%. The Recorded Music streaming revenue increased 11%, led by subscription streaming growth of 13.5%. This was driven by stronger music performance as well as subscriber growth and subscription price increases.\n Total adjusted OIBDA increased 9% or 10% on a normalized basis. In Recorded Music, we continue to break new artists, build global careers and mine our extraordinary catalog. This quarter, we saw massive hits from artists across different genres in all stages of development, exactly the kind of mix we want. Benson Boone and Teddy Swims are standout audit development stories of the year. They are also both signed to Warner Records as recording artists as well as to Warner Chappell as songwriters.\n During the quarter, Benson Boone reached #1 on Spotify global chart, while Teddy Swims and Megan Thee Stallion individually hit #1 on the U.S. Hot 100chart. Benson, Megan and Teddy all spend weeks in the Hot 100 top 10, alongside carryover hits from Jack Harlow and Zach Bryan. Around the world, we also had #1 from Myke Towers, Green Day, Jolie and [Blast].\n We also continue to attract outstanding global talent with recent signings, including India-based Superstar, Nora Fatehi, top Ukrainian rock band, Okean Elzy and legendary multi-Grammy winning icon, Ang\u00e9lique Kidjo. It's encouraging to see our audits creating bodies of work with real staying power.\n These new releases are our catalog of the future. Here are some great examples of how our so-called shallow catalog is contributing to revenue growth. Ed Sheeran's Divide released in 2017 and Dua Lipa's Future Nostalgia released in 2020 are both in our top earning albums for the quarter. Deep catalog releases that are more than 10 years old, also remains an important growth area with meaningful untapped opportunity.\n When we market catalog with the same ingenuity as new releases, they often have a significant impact. For example, at this year's Grammys, our recording artists, Tracy Chapman and Joni Mitchell both performed classic songs that saw a big boost in weekly audio streams of over 180%, respectively.\n Our Music Publishing division, Warner Chappell, continues to perform extremely well. Our songwriters contributed to a range of recent hits from Benson Boone's Beautiful Things, Teddy Swims' Lose Control and Jack Harlow's Lovin' On Me to Ariana Grande's We Can't Be Friends and Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign's Carnival. Top-tier songwriters continue to recognize Warner Chappell's momentum. Recent signings include 5 Grammy nominee Coco Jones and Dua Lipa, who joins other superstars such as Cardi B, Zach Bryan, Madonna and Led Zeppelin, who are represented by our company for both recorded music and music publishing.\n As reported in music and copyright, we outpaced our peers in 2023, growing our global market share in Music Publishing. Simply said, we've executed well on expanding our [song guiding] roster, strengthening our services and finding innovative ways for songs to get heard. Impressively, this growth has largely been achieved organically, not through acquisitions at frothy multiples. Further evidence of our success in identifying world-class songwriters early.\n A great example is the phenomenal success of British Singer-Songwriter Raye. She signed to Warner Chappell 9 years ago. In March, she matched records for the most nominations and wins in a single year at the Brit Awards. In addition to her solo work, she's written hit songs for the likes of Beyonce, Rihanna and John Legend.\n Earlier this year, I laid out three strategic priorities: grow engagement with our music, increase the value of our music and evolve how we work together. We continue to make important progress on all these fronts. First, growing engagement with our music. This is primarily driven by signing and serving ever broadening spectrum of artists and songwriters. Identifying and investing in territories where local music is gaining global appeal and helping our talent break through the noise in a cluttered and fiercely competitive environment.\n Unusual for a company of our scale, most of our biggest stars are homegrown talent who have been with us since the earliest days of their careers. Bruno Mars, Ed Sheeran, Cardi B and Dua Lipa among others. We're building on this legacy by nurturing original artists into the next generation of superstars. A great example is Warner Records who are the hottest label in the U.S. right now due to their focus on genuine talent and long-term artist development.\n In an industry where it's harder than ever to cut through, Warner Records has bucked the trend with success stories like Zach Bryan, Benson Boone and Teddy Swims, and their hot streak shows no sign of slowing down.\n Last September, we announced a joint venture with 10K projects, founded by Elliott Grainge. 10K operates as a stand-alone U.S. label, opening up a whole new channel through which we can bring quality talent to market. From the get-go, this has been a success -- this has been successful for Warner Music Group both commercially and creatively. 10K continues to deliver incredible hits with Artemas' latest single, I Like The Way You Kiss Me going #1 on Spotify global chart.\n As I've mentioned before, we continue to fuel our growth organically and via partnerships and acquisitions. As part of our mission to be a destination for artists and songwriters at every stage of development, we're expanding our lower touch services that many independent artists, labels and songwriters rely on. It's just one recent example. Last month, Warner Chappell partnered with BandLab the social music creation platform. We'll work together to identify and sign emerging songwriters, providing them with access to our comprehensive suite of offerings. We have a clear plan to develop this area of our ecosystem across the company, and we're building solutions in-house, while staying vigilant about our M&A opportunities, which could accelerate our capabilities.\n At the same time, we're expanding our presence in dynamic recorded music markets. We've seen impressive results this past year. In Argentina, the fastest-growing market in 2023, we doubled our year-over-year revenue organically. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the fastest-growing region in 2022 and 2023, we were the only major music company to grow share last year. In India, already the 14th largest market [in climbing pass], we were again the only major to grow share, in 2023. We continue to find ways to turbocharge our growth and strengthen our global platform for local talent.\n Last month, we launched Warner Music South Asia to address a region with 400 million people across Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Turning to our next strategic priority, growing the value of our music.\n There are two aspects to achieving this, growing the pie and growing our participation in the pie. Over the past year, there have been some initial steps in the right direction to growing the pie, including the first price increases at all major DSPs. We will continue to advocate for further increases, as well as more sophisticated price optimization, especially as DSPs improve their offerings to bring in more subscribers.\n We've also seen encouraging early signs in the evolution of royalty models, but are aligning economics with premium content, thus growing our participation in the pie. It's important to note that these shifts to more artist-centric models take time to fully implement, and we don't expect immediate impact on our results. We're making every effort to build alignment with our partners, and it's the best way to ensure that the value that music provides to these platforms is properly recognized.\n Another area where we see great potential to grow the value of music is AI. And like I said before, there are three constituents which play critical roles in the evolution of AI, platforms, models and governments. The concepts of control, monetization, attribution and prominence are the core of our discussions with all parties in order to protect artists, songwriters and right holders.\n Last Tuesday, I testified on the promise and perils of generative AI before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on intellectual property, voicing the shared concerns of the creative community. I urge Congress to act this year and pass a federal law that addresses deep fakes. My central message was that the use of people's likeness and voice requires consent and must be subject to free market negotiations. We should not abide by the appropriation of people's identities and the theft of artist livelihoods.\n I'll briefly highlight one amazing example of the power of AI when done right. Since 2013, Randy Travis had aphasia, a condition that limits its ability to speak and sing. Last week, the Legendary Grammy award-winning country music Hall of Famer was able to release new music for the first time in over a decade, thanks to AI. We played his new song, where that came from on our pre-call hold music, and you should add it to your playlist right now.\n Moving on to my third priority, evolving how we work. On our last earnings call, we announced a restructuring plan, which will enable us to increase our investment in music, technology and new skill sets. We are on track, although the full savings will not be realized until the end of fiscal '25, the majority of the changes have already been implemented. This includes centralizing certain functions and exiting our owned and operated media businesses. Since we last spoke, we have sold the entertainment of websites, UPROXX and HipHopDX.\n We're allowing a strong foundation to accelerate our progress and yield greater value over time. As part of this, we continue to develop our tech capabilities. I'll give you a few examples of some of our projects. We've made improvements to our royalty systems and the tools used to identify unclaimed revenue. We've overhauled our global supply chain, unlocking our ability to scale our third-party distribution business, and we've transformed our proprietary tools that identify fan trends, while building new ways to engage with superfans.\n Our second half includes eagerly anticipated music from Dua Lipa, who dropped her new album Radical Optimism last Friday. And we're excited about our new releases from Twenty One Pilots, Sia, [Gaana], Megan Thee Stallion, David Guetta, Fred Again, Charlie Puth and Maria Bechara. This is an exciting and transformative period for our company and for the music industry. We're looking forward to building incredible careers and creating dynamic new opportunities in the months and years ahead. And with that, I'll turn it over to Bryan. \nBryan Castellani: Thank you, Robert, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into details of our Q2 results, I want to remind everyone that growth rate comparisons will be in constant currency.\n The items affecting recorded music streaming revenue, comparability, include the BMG digital revenue roll-off, which was $22 million unfavorable in the quarter. Additionally, the renewal with one of our international digital partners that resulted in upfront incremental revenue recognition of $27 million last quarter, resulted in an unfavorable impact of $4 million this quarter and will have a similar impact in Q3 and Q4. Details relating to these items can be found in our earnings press release.\n In Q2, total revenue grew 7% and adjusted OIBDA increased 9% with a margin of 20.9% and an increase of 40 basis points over the prior year quarter. On a normalized basis, total revenue grew 9%, and adjusted OIBDA increased 10%.\n Recorded Music revenue grew 4% and 7% on a normalized basis. Streaming revenue grew 11% on a comparable basis with subscription streaming growth accelerating to 13.5%, while ad supported revenue increased 5%. The improvement in subscription growth was driven by stronger DSP sub performance, along with price increases, partially offset by a deceleration in ad supported revenue, driven by platform mix.\n Physical revenue decreased 7%, driven by the timing of releases. Artist services and expanded rights revenue decreased 3% due to lower merchandising revenue, partially offset by higher concert promotion revenue in France and Japan. Licensing revenue grew 5%, primarily due to the timing of legal settlements. Recorded music adjusted OIBDA increased 9% with a margin of 22.9%, an increase of 110 basis points. On a normalized basis, adjusted OIBDA increased 10%.\n Music Publishing continues to deliver impressive results with revenue growth of 19%, driven by streaming and performance revenue. Digital and streaming revenue increased by 27% and 29%, respectively, reflecting the continued growth in streaming and the impact of digital deal renewals. We also benefited from the continued investment in and expansion of our publishing catalog.\n Performance revenue increased by 18% due to strong artist touring activity in Europe, while sync revenue increased 2%, driven by timing of legal settlements. Mechanical revenue decreased 6% due to lower physical sales. Music Publishing adjusted OIBDA grew 8% with a margin of 26.8%, a decrease of 270 basis points due to revenue mix.\n Turning to CapEx, we saw a $9 million decrease from the prior year quarter to $26 million due to the timing of tech investment. Operating cash flow decreased to a use of $31 million from a use of $6 million in the prior year quarter, due to increased ANR investment and timing of working capital items. Free cash flow decreased to a use of $57 million from a use of $41 million in the prior year quarter. Our goal continues to be to deliver operating cash flow conversion of 50% to 60% over a multiyear period, which we expect to achieve for full year 2024.\n As of March 31, we had a cash balance of $587 million, total debt of $4 billion and net debt of $3.4 billion. Our weighted average cost of debt was 4.5% and our nearest maturity date remains 2028. In February, we announced a plan to deliver $200 million of annualized run rate cost savings by the end of fiscal 2025. The plan is proceeding according to schedule. We achieved modest cost savings in the quarter, the majority of which were reinvested into tech.\n Regarding BMG, we estimate the revenue impact to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million in both Q3 and Q4, eventually rolling off completely in fiscal 2025. As a reminder, BMG's physical distribution will roll off in fiscal 2025. As we look ahead, Q3 is off to a solid start. As Robert mentioned, we are excited about our upcoming releases. The momentum in music in the business is strong, and we continue to position ourselves for long-term success, including to deliver on our goals of healthy top line growth, margin expansion and strong cash flow conversion on a consistent basis. Thank you to everyone for joining us today. We'll now open the call for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Benjamin Black of Deutsche Bank. \nBenjamin Black: I have two. So Robert, last quarter, you're obviously contemplating a bid, formal bid for [Believe]. You've obviously since withdrawn your interest. So I'd be curious to hear sort of why that deal fell apart. And also it would be good to hear sort of where strategic M&A fits into your capital allocation hierarchy right now?\n And then secondly, there appears to be quite a few developments on the pricing front. Spotify is currently in the early innings of introducing a tiered structure, with what at least appears to us, to be a potential surcharge for audio books. So I guess the question is, will Warner potentially benefit from that incremental surcharge? Or is it more of a carve-out? And relatedly, with their bundled offering, by your knowledge, at least qualify for lower mechanical rates as dictated by the CRB in the U.S.? \nRobert Kyncl: All right. Thank you. So on Believe.  As I've mentioned on, I think, several earnings calls, we have a clear strategy in expanding our offerings to serve more audits across wider array of their careers. And obviously, we are building against that. So we have our team working really hard, building all the right features that we need.\n But as any other steward of our business, we always look at ways to accelerate and because all of this work takes time. And anytime there's an option in the market that allows us to accelerate our road maps we will look at it. We pursue that with belief. This was a very unique situation because the timing was out of our control, the public nature of it with part of our control, and the extremely short time frame for diligence was out of our control.\n So obviously, played out publicly. We decided to -- not to pursue it for a variety of reasons, that I really can't go into. And -- but our strategy is to continue to look for opportunities that can augment our built strategy, and we continue to do that.\n On pricing and evolution of evolution of pricing and especially as it relates to bundling. So first, what I would say is that bundling is generally good for subscription business because it achieves two things. One, it tends to lower subscriber acquisition cost and it tends to lower churn rate. So for platforms, it becomes a strong growth driver. And we've obviously had 50 years of very healthy television market through bundling, and if you look at many different sectors, you can see that.\n The job of wholesalers like the music companies like ourselves is to ensure that the sanctity of our pricing across the different services, whether individual subscriptions, stand-alone subscriptions or bundled offerings are in line with each other. So you can expect us to pursue that strategy.\n As it relates to what you were referring to, the CRB, which is a U.S. specific issue. I don't see it as something that will persist in the long term. I believe in sort of global solutions. We're in a global business, all of us and sort of individual carve-outs in any markets. I don't think play out well amongst parties that are tied at the hip and partners for the future. So I have a confident point of view on that. \nBryan Castellani: And Ben, it's Bryan. And just to echo what Robert said on the capital allocation hierarchy, there's really no change there as we've articulated before, and we've walked you through our cascade. We continue to see plenty of runway on organic investment, which you continue to see in our artist signings and ANR investment as well as we continue to expand our publishing and catalog rights. Last year, we acquired 10K, which was a smaller inorganic acquisition. And of course, we also continue to return capital via the dividend to shareholders.\n As Robert said, it's our job to survey the market. And if there's inorganic opportunities that will accelerate our initiatives, we'll take those. But I think we've always demonstrated to be good stewards financially, and we will continue to do that. And I think our interest in Believe was well founded in looking through our capital allocation hierarchy, if it could accelerate it. But again, the unique nature of it led to the outcome. But no change there on capital allocation. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley. \nUnknown Analyst: This is Cameron on for Ben. You guys have previously described this year as a second half weighted year from a release slate perspective. Is that still your expectation as we look through the remainder of the year? And does that translate into accelerating organic streaming growth over the next couple of quarters?\n And then another one, if I can. What, to the extent you can share with us, drove the [indiscernible] sale and add an emerging platform organic growth from last quarter to this quarter? I know you called out platform mix, but anything in addition to that, that you could provide would be helpful. \nRobert Kyncl: All right. I'll take the first, and Bryan will take the second. Thank you, Ben. So we remain excited about our new music. We have lots of great content coming from the likes of Dua Lipa. She just released her album. Twenty One Pilots, Sia, Gaana and so on and on and on. At the same time, we're also having a great real-time success, which is amazing to see with Teddy Swim, Benson Boone and Artemas.\n So that's -- so we've been doing well on new music. The one thing that you should keep in mind is that we've now seen the full impact of the Spotify price increases in our results. And in the second half, we'll be lapping last year's price increases with the other DSPs, namely Apple and YouTube. So -- but we're continually encouraged by the subscriber growth as well. \nBryan Castellani: Cameron, it's Bryan. Just to maybe break down the quarter a bit, and the overall Recorded Music streaming of 11% on a normalized basis. Within that, I would say 2 or 3 pieces accelerated. You saw subscription at 13.5% versus 12% in the prior quarter. And then while ad supported and emerging combined decelerated, we did see growth and accelerating trend there in the traditional ad supported. Emerging can have some lumpiness based on deal timing, content delivery as well as mix of platforms.\n But again, the underlying strength there in the core subscription streaming and the traditional ad supported and overall, I think you got to look at emerging, while there may be some lumpiness, we still believe it's a growing category. And so it -- over the long term, we expect it to continue to grow. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Batya Levi of UBS. \nBatya Levi: Can you talk a little bit more about the initiatives to monetize super [fans]? I think you had plans launch an app. How are you approaching the partnership with DSPs versus going direct in that initiative? \nBryan Castellani: Sure. Thank you. Yes. So we've been working on i,. and it's well progressed, but nothing new to announce on that. On partnership with DSPs, the way we think about this partnerships versus doing it ourselves. The one, I think, unique insight with music is that unlike other forms of creation, it's incredibly ubiquitous. If you're an artist, you want your content to be distributed as widely as possible across as many touch points.\n And therefore, it's very hard to optimize for any individual platform, and try to anchor a superfans relationship in one place because your superfans are across many, many different platforms, which means I think we're naturally set up to be the right place to do this and do it cross-platform. And then we can always partner with the DSPs, but through the offering that we have. But I just think it's the absolutely ubiquitous nature of music. And finding super fans across all of those, but you can't optimize for any single place, any single platform. Therefore, it has to be a controlled solution. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kutgun Maral of Evercore ISI.\n Our next question comes from the line of Michael Morris of Guggenheim Securities. \nMichael Morris: I had two topics, if I can. The first I wanted to follow up on the question about pricing changes at Spotify, in particular. As you see the pricing changes that they have announced right now and the structure of those price changes, do you expect to participate in the incremental revenue that's being generated from the new pricing plans? Or do you see it as all specifically earmarked for their audio book product, that is part of a pool that you don't participate in?\n And also, do you think that this change by Spotify is sort of representative of another leg of the cycle of pricing, Robert, that you've spoken about in the past is helping to close that gap between the intrinsic value of music and the current price point?\n And then second, I wanted to ask about the lower touch services that you referenced developing. How do you -- I don't know if you could expand on this a little bit, but how do you ensure that this creates a pipeline to sort of deeper artist relationships that you can progress on, as opposed to offering a service that just kind of sustainably meets artist needs in kind of a less revenue or less profit-generating manner? \nRobert Kyncl: Okay. So on the first one. So first, what I would say is that we had 15 years of no price action by anyone, including myself, and [when I was on YouTube]. And so it is amazing to see that, a, we have price increases, that we actually can, on an earnings call, say words like we're now lapping 1 year anniversary of a price increase. I mean I just want to make sure it doesn't go unnoticed, because it has not existed for 15 years. So amazing, and now it's happening.\n Two, I think as services are growing and thinking through their pricing strategies. Obviously, this indicates that they're thinking about it super hard. They're coming with all kinds of different solutions, and bundled solutions are part of that suite. So I think all of that is a good news.\n The -- what -- as I mentioned before, I think we, the music companies have to make sure that the sanctity of our pricing is upheld correctly and that, that pricing also keeps on moving up all the time, as [I'm talking about] all the time. But the appropriate steps -- but it doesn't mean that there wouldn't be higher-priced bundled offerings that are allocated for those additional content providers. But that also benefits us because now there is a bundled offering.\n Now there is a single offering. And as long as we price it correctly, ourselves, we will benefit. So I think all of this is the right direction, right things that our partners are focused on. There may be bumps in the road along the way, obviously, right, it's playing out with the CRB thing. But this is good news, in my opinion, to push forward.\n On the second question, the lower touch, lower touch services. I think it's important to realize that there are artists who are getting started. At many different stages of their career, somebody has no following and [ over ] somebody has a big one. And it's important for us to effectively widen the net in which we can work with artists and find great talent. So it's really -- it's basically about the deal flow, if you really put it in business terms.\n And I think the thing that we're focused on is to make sure that we don't simply just follow the model where we have more shops in the goal, but the same sort of -- I'm going to mix two sports analogies, but same batting average. But -- but then we also actually are making money from the shots on the goal, that we actually run the business more profitably across these offerings. And so I think that's what your question was getting at. And that is exactly the intent.\n We want to make sure that we're building things in a way that it's technology dependent, that is providing operating leverage and then not only we get more shots on the goal, but also improve our outs overall and have a profitable relationship and mutually beneficial relationship with all of the artists in the system. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Karnovsky of JPMorgan. \nDavid Karnovsky: Robert, you noted in the quarter, the contribution from shallow and deep catalog results. Maybe a follow-up on this. [Absent] an artist, putting out a new album, what are some tools you have to kind of drive increased engagement with your older content? And then separately, looking at Universal and TikTok's announcement, there's a lot of lip service paid to potential protections around AI and then also co-development of tools to enable creativity. I just wanted to follow up here. Does this agreement anything incremental for WMG and kind of your ability to make the imports front? \nRobert Kyncl: I ask you to repeat the first question, I couldn't really capture it. \nDavid Karnovsky: Sure. It was just a follow-up on your comments around shallow and deep catalog and what tools you have in your disposal, absent an artist putting out a new album to drive more engagement with older content. \nRobert Kyncl: All right. So on the first one, this has actually been an area of focus for us for quite some time. And the best way to think about this is that, obviously, catalog is a tremendous wealth that we have. It's a -- it's something that continues to grow, pay dividends. And it's just an incredible resource for us. And -- the -- when you think about where a vast majority of the revenue is coming from, it's digital distribution.\n Therefore, if we want to increase the performance of catalog, we have to make sure that we optimize all of our titles, across all of our main DSPs. And now this sounds very, very simple said that way. But when you think about the size and scale of our catalog, it's a very, very difficult task. And it's one that you can't only do with people because the number of SKUs is simply too high.\n So we have a project on this across our technology team and our business team to basically move down through the entire catalog and make sure it's properly optimized for streaming in on every single large DSP. So it's a very sort of methodical approach. And all of this augments our marketing campaigns against catalog, which we have done in the past, which we continue to do, and we're applying more and more frontline like focus on catalog titles, and that's also yielding results. So it's kind of like a 2-pronged approach, one, which is very, very scaled. And then the other one, which is very high touch where we select what we push.\n On the second part on UMG [ pick dock], obviously, I have no details about their business. So I can't really comment on it at all other than what I can say is that I'm pleased that they reached an agreement. And as I said, that the Morgan Stanley conference, I think, on stage with Ben Swinburne. And I think Lucian also said the same thing recently, which is this category is still very much in the early stage of evolution. And we need to stay vigilant to make sure that it's driving accretive growth to our companies. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Laszczyk of Goldman Sachs. \nStephen Laszczyk: Bryan, on margins, I was curious if there's any help you could give us on the expected pace of margin expansion this year, just as we see some of the cost efficiencies to flow through the income statement and how that's comparing versus the rate at which you can reinvest. Any help there would be great. And then maybe just on the market for music rights. Would be curious if you could give us an update on what you're seeing in that market. It feels like there was hope at the bid ask will get closer as rates came down, but that appears that might not be the case at this point. Just curious what you're hearing on that front. \nBryan Castellani: Stephen, thanks, Bryan. On margin, and as we say, we remain focused on our three goals of healthy top line, margin expansion, cash flow conversion. We did call out and reiterate the cash flow conversion this quarter, just knowing that Q2 is seasonally a timing -- a quarter where with timing of receivables and payments and deal timing that we do have low cash conversion. And on margin, again, we're -- as we look out over the year, and I think you got to look at that over the course of the year, rather than quarter-to-quarter. There will be lumpiness in margin, again, based on timing slate deals, as well as just internal efficiencies. So we remain focused on it. We don't guide quarter-to-quarter, but I think you can look over the long term and now we're focused on it. \nRobert Kyncl: And then -- and on the content rights market, -- as we -- I think, first, the second question was around capital allocation and M&A, et cetera, and Bryan answered and saying, look, we're looking at lots of different content rights, as well as technology solutions that augment our built in-house road map. And on the content rights piece, there's a lot of opportunities, the pipelines of deals that we're maintaining ARPU significant. It is more than we can even afford today.\n And therefore, we're very diligent about what we go after and the returns that we can yield from that and it's all around the world. So there are a lot of different opportunities, and we expect those to continue and perhaps even increase, because there have been many buyers in the past who may need to make changes in their portfolios. \nBryan Castellani: Yes. And Stephen, I would just add to that. I mean there's a bit of a double-edged sword there in terms of higher rates, making it more rigorous. I think you're also seeing a maturation or rationalization across buyers in the market, but also that the interest and the pricing, just speaks to the value of music, and I think it's just an attractive space. And so as Robert said, we still see runway there and our ability to invest. \nRobert Kyncl: Okay. So I think that's it for -- with all the questions. I really appreciate your time. Thank you for all your questions. And please do you not forget to go to your favorite DSP and listen to Randy Travis and his song, where that came from which was generated with AI, with Randy's permission with his producer, from his entire life, and it's just a wonderful collaboration an example of what is possible with AI. Thank you. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Robert Kyncl",
            "content": "Thanks, Kareem. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I am pleased with everything our global team is doing to deliver for our artists and songwriters and drive our business forward.\n In Q2, total revenue increased 7% with Recorded Music and Music Publishing increasing 4% and 19%, respectively. On a normalized basis, total revenue grew 9% with Recorded Music up 7%. The Recorded Music streaming revenue increased 11%, led by subscription streaming growth of 13.5%. This was driven by stronger music performance as well as subscriber growth and subscription price increases.\n Total adjusted OIBDA increased 9% or 10% on a normalized basis. In Recorded Music, we continue to break new artists, build global careers and mine our extraordinary catalog. This quarter, we saw massive hits from artists across different genres in all stages of development, exactly the kind of mix we want. Benson Boone and Teddy Swims are standout audit development stories of the year. They are also both signed to Warner Records as recording artists as well as to Warner Chappell as songwriters.\n During the quarter, Benson Boone reached #1 on Spotify global chart, while Teddy Swims and Megan Thee Stallion individually hit #1 on the U.S. Hot 100chart. Benson, Megan and Teddy all spend weeks in the Hot 100 top 10, alongside carryover hits from Jack Harlow and Zach Bryan. Around the world, we also had #1 from Myke Towers, Green Day, Jolie and [Blast].\n We also continue to attract outstanding global talent with recent signings, including India-based Superstar, Nora Fatehi, top Ukrainian rock band, Okean Elzy and legendary multi-Grammy winning icon, Ange\u0301lique Kidjo. It's encouraging to see our audits creating bodies of work with real staying power.\n These new releases are our catalog of the future. Here are some great examples of how our so-called shallow catalog is contributing to revenue growth. Ed Sheeran's Divide released in 2017 and Dua Lipa's Future Nostalgia released in 2020 are both in our top earning albums for the quarter. Deep catalog releases that are more than 10 years old, also remains an important growth area with meaningful untapped opportunity.\n When we market catalog with the same ingenuity as new releases, they often have a significant impact. For example, at this year's Grammys, our recording artists, Tracy Chapman and Joni Mitchell both performed classic songs that saw a big boost in weekly audio streams of over 180%, respectively.\n Our Music Publishing division, Warner Chappell, continues to perform extremely well. Our songwriters contributed to a range of recent hits from Benson Boone's Beautiful Things, Teddy Swims' Lose Control and Jack Harlow's Lovin' On Me to Ariana Grande's We Can't Be Friends and Kanye West and Ty Dolla $ign's Carnival. Top-tier songwriters continue to recognize Warner Chappell's momentum. Recent signings include 5 Grammy nominee Coco Jones and Dua Lipa, who joins other superstars such as Cardi B, Zach Bryan, Madonna and Led Zeppelin, who are represented by our company for both recorded music and music publishing.\n As reported in music and copyright, we outpaced our peers in 2023, growing our global market share in Music Publishing. Simply said, we've executed well on expanding our [song guiding] roster, strengthening our services and finding innovative ways for songs to get heard. Impressively, this growth has largely been achieved organically, not through acquisitions at frothy multiples. Further evidence of our success in identifying world-class songwriters early.\n A great example is the phenomenal success of British Singer-Songwriter Raye. She signed to Warner Chappell 9 years ago. In March, she matched records for the most nominations and wins in a single year at the Brit Awards. In addition to her solo work, she's written hit songs for the likes of Beyonce, Rihanna and John Legend.\n Earlier this year, I laid out three strategic priorities: grow engagement with our music, increase the value of our music and evolve how we work together. We continue to make important progress on all these fronts. First, growing engagement with our music. This is primarily driven by signing and serving ever broadening spectrum of artists and songwriters. Identifying and investing in territories where local music is gaining global appeal and helping our talent break through the noise in a cluttered and fiercely competitive environment.\n Unusual for a company of our scale, most of our biggest stars are homegrown talent who have been with us since the earliest days of their careers. Bruno Mars, Ed Sheeran, Cardi B and Dua Lipa among others. We're building on this legacy by nurturing original artists into the next generation of superstars. A great example is Warner Records who are the hottest label in the U.S. right now due to their focus on genuine talent and long-term artist development.\n In an industry where it's harder than ever to cut through, Warner Records has bucked the trend with success stories like Zach Bryan, Benson Boone and Teddy Swims, and their hot streak shows no sign of slowing down.\n Last September, we announced a joint venture with 10K projects, founded by Elliott Grainge. 10K operates as a stand-alone U.S. label, opening up a whole new channel through which we can bring quality talent to market. From the get-go, this has been a success -- this has been successful for Warner Music Group both commercially and creatively. 10K continues to deliver incredible hits with Artemas' latest single, I Like The Way You Kiss Me going #1 on Spotify global chart.\n As I've mentioned before, we continue to fuel our growth organically and via partnerships and acquisitions. As part of our mission to be a destination for artists and songwriters at every stage of development, we're expanding our lower touch services that many independent artists, labels and songwriters rely on. It's just one recent example. Last month, Warner Chappell partnered with BandLab the social music creation platform. We'll work together to identify and sign emerging songwriters, providing them with access to our comprehensive suite of offerings. We have a clear plan to develop this area of our ecosystem across the company, and we're building solutions in-house, while staying vigilant about our M&A opportunities, which could accelerate our capabilities.\n At the same time, we're expanding our presence in dynamic recorded music markets. We've seen impressive results this past year. In Argentina, the fastest-growing market in 2023, we doubled our year-over-year revenue organically. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the fastest-growing region in 2022 and 2023, we were the only major music company to grow share last year. In India, already the 14th largest market [in climbing pass], we were again the only major to grow share, in 2023. We continue to find ways to turbocharge our growth and strengthen our global platform for local talent.\n Last month, we launched Warner Music South Asia to address a region with 400 million people across Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Turning to our next strategic priority, growing the value of our music.\n There are two aspects to achieving this, growing the pie and growing our participation in the pie. Over the past year, there have been some initial steps in the right direction to growing the pie, including the first price increases at all major DSPs. We will continue to advocate for further increases, as well as more sophisticated price optimization, especially as DSPs improve their offerings to bring in more subscribers.\n We've also seen encouraging early signs in the evolution of royalty models, but are aligning economics with premium content, thus growing our participation in the pie. It's important to note that these shifts to more artist-centric models take time to fully implement, and we don't expect immediate impact on our results. We're making every effort to build alignment with our partners, and it's the best way to ensure that the value that music provides to these platforms is properly recognized.\n Another area where we see great potential to grow the value of music is AI. And like I said before, there are three constituents which play critical roles in the evolution of AI, platforms, models and governments. The concepts of control, monetization, attribution and prominence are the core of our discussions with all parties in order to protect artists, songwriters and right holders.\n Last Tuesday, I testified on the promise and perils of generative AI before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on intellectual property, voicing the shared concerns of the creative community. I urge Congress to act this year and pass a federal law that addresses deep fakes. My central message was that the use of people's likeness and voice requires consent and must be subject to free market negotiations. We should not abide by the appropriation of people's identities and the theft of artist livelihoods.\n I'll briefly highlight one amazing example of the power of AI when done right. Since 2013, Randy Travis had aphasia, a condition that limits its ability to speak and sing. Last week, the Legendary Grammy award-winning country music Hall of Famer was able to release new music for the first time in over a decade, thanks to AI. We played his new song, where that came from on our pre-call hold music, and you should add it to your playlist right now.\n Moving on to my third priority, evolving how we work. On our last earnings call, we announced a restructuring plan, which will enable us to increase our investment in music, technology and new skill sets. We are on track, although the full savings will not be realized until the end of fiscal '25, the majority of the changes have already been implemented. This includes centralizing certain functions and exiting our owned and operated media businesses. Since we last spoke, we have sold the entertainment of websites, UPROXX and HipHopDX.\n We're allowing a strong foundation to accelerate our progress and yield greater value over time. As part of this, we continue to develop our tech capabilities. I'll give you a few examples of some of our projects. We've made improvements to our royalty systems and the tools used to identify unclaimed revenue. We've overhauled our global supply chain, unlocking our ability to scale our third-party distribution business, and we've transformed our proprietary tools that identify fan trends, while building new ways to engage with superfans.\n Our second half includes eagerly anticipated music from Dua Lipa, who dropped her new album Radical Optimism last Friday. And we're excited about our new releases from Twenty One Pilots, Sia, [Gaana], Megan Thee Stallion, David Guetta, Fred Again, Charlie Puth and Maria Bechara. This is an exciting and transformative period for our company and for the music industry. We're looking forward to building incredible careers and creating dynamic new opportunities in the months and years ahead. And with that, I'll turn it over to Bryan. All right. Thank you. So on Believe.  As I've mentioned on, I think, several earnings calls, we have a clear strategy in expanding our offerings to serve more audits across wider array of their careers. And obviously, we are building against that. So we have our team working really hard, building all the right features that we need.\n But as any other steward of our business, we always look at ways to accelerate and because all of this work takes time. And anytime there's an option in the market that allows us to accelerate our road maps we will look at it. We pursue that with belief. This was a very unique situation because the timing was out of our control, the public nature of it with part of our control, and the extremely short time frame for diligence was out of our control.\n So obviously, played out publicly. We decided to -- not to pursue it for a variety of reasons, that I really can't go into. And -- but our strategy is to continue to look for opportunities that can augment our built strategy, and we continue to do that.\n On pricing and evolution of evolution of pricing and especially as it relates to bundling. So first, what I would say is that bundling is generally good for subscription business because it achieves two things. One, it tends to lower subscriber acquisition cost and it tends to lower churn rate. So for platforms, it becomes a strong growth driver. And we've obviously had 50 years of very healthy television market through bundling, and if you look at many different sectors, you can see that.\n The job of wholesalers like the music companies like ourselves is to ensure that the sanctity of our pricing across the different services, whether individual subscriptions, stand-alone subscriptions or bundled offerings are in line with each other. So you can expect us to pursue that strategy.\n As it relates to what you were referring to, the CRB, which is a U.S. specific issue. I don't see it as something that will persist in the long term. I believe in sort of global solutions. We're in a global business, all of us and sort of individual carve-outs in any markets. I don't think play out well amongst parties that are tied at the hip and partners for the future. So I have a confident point of view on that. All right. I'll take the first, and Bryan will take the second. Thank you, Ben. So we remain excited about our new music. We have lots of great content coming from the likes of Dua Lipa. She just released her album. Twenty One Pilots, Sia, Gaana and so on and on and on. At the same time, we're also having a great real-time success, which is amazing to see with Teddy Swim, Benson Boone and Artemas.\n So that's -- so we've been doing well on new music. The one thing that you should keep in mind is that we've now seen the full impact of the Spotify price increases in our results. And in the second half, we'll be lapping last year's price increases with the other DSPs, namely Apple and YouTube. So -- but we're continually encouraged by the subscriber growth as well. Okay. So on the first one. So first, what I would say is that we had 15 years of no price action by anyone, including myself, and [when I was on YouTube]. And so it is amazing to see that, a, we have price increases, that we actually can, on an earnings call, say words like we're now lapping 1 year anniversary of a price increase. I mean I just want to make sure it doesn't go unnoticed, because it has not existed for 15 years. So amazing, and now it's happening.\n Two, I think as services are growing and thinking through their pricing strategies. Obviously, this indicates that they're thinking about it super hard. They're coming with all kinds of different solutions, and bundled solutions are part of that suite. So I think all of that is a good news.\n The -- what -- as I mentioned before, I think we, the music companies have to make sure that the sanctity of our pricing is upheld correctly and that, that pricing also keeps on moving up all the time, as [I'm talking about] all the time. But the appropriate steps -- but it doesn't mean that there wouldn't be higher-priced bundled offerings that are allocated for those additional content providers. But that also benefits us because now there is a bundled offering.\n Now there is a single offering. And as long as we price it correctly, ourselves, we will benefit. So I think all of this is the right direction, right things that our partners are focused on. There may be bumps in the road along the way, obviously, right, it's playing out with the CRB thing. But this is good news, in my opinion, to push forward.\n On the second question, the lower touch, lower touch services. I think it's important to realize that there are artists who are getting started. At many different stages of their career, somebody has no following and [ over ] somebody has a big one. And it's important for us to effectively widen the net in which we can work with artists and find great talent. So it's really -- it's basically about the deal flow, if you really put it in business terms.\n And I think the thing that we're focused on is to make sure that we don't simply just follow the model where we have more shops in the goal, but the same sort of -- I'm going to mix two sports analogies, but same batting average. But -- but then we also actually are making money from the shots on the goal, that we actually run the business more profitably across these offerings. And so I think that's what your question was getting at. And that is exactly the intent.\n We want to make sure that we're building things in a way that it's technology dependent, that is providing operating leverage and then not only we get more shots on the goal, but also improve our outs overall and have a profitable relationship and mutually beneficial relationship with all of the artists in the system. I ask you to repeat the first question, I couldn't really capture it. All right. So on the first one, this has actually been an area of focus for us for quite some time. And the best way to think about this is that, obviously, catalog is a tremendous wealth that we have. It's a -- it's something that continues to grow, pay dividends. And it's just an incredible resource for us. And -- the -- when you think about where a vast majority of the revenue is coming from, it's digital distribution.\n Therefore, if we want to increase the performance of catalog, we have to make sure that we optimize all of our titles, across all of our main DSPs. And now this sounds very, very simple said that way. But when you think about the size and scale of our catalog, it's a very, very difficult task. And it's one that you can't only do with people because the number of SKUs is simply too high.\n So we have a project on this across our technology team and our business team to basically move down through the entire catalog and make sure it's properly optimized for streaming in on every single large DSP. So it's a very sort of methodical approach. And all of this augments our marketing campaigns against catalog, which we have done in the past, which we continue to do, and we're applying more and more frontline like focus on catalog titles, and that's also yielding results. So it's kind of like a 2-pronged approach, one, which is very, very scaled. And then the other one, which is very high touch where we select what we push.\n On the second part on UMG [ pick dock], obviously, I have no details about their business. So I can't really comment on it at all other than what I can say is that I'm pleased that they reached an agreement. And as I said, that the Morgan Stanley conference, I think, on stage with Ben Swinburne. And I think Lucian also said the same thing recently, which is this category is still very much in the early stage of evolution. And we need to stay vigilant to make sure that it's driving accretive growth to our companies. And then -- and on the content rights market, -- as we -- I think, first, the second question was around capital allocation and M&A, et cetera, and Bryan answered and saying, look, we're looking at lots of different content rights, as well as technology solutions that augment our built in-house road map. And on the content rights piece, there's a lot of opportunities, the pipelines of deals that we're maintaining ARPU significant. It is more than we can even afford today.\n And therefore, we're very diligent about what we go after and the returns that we can yield from that and it's all around the world. So there are a lot of different opportunities, and we expect those to continue and perhaps even increase, because there have been many buyers in the past who may need to make changes in their portfolios. Okay. So I think that's it for -- with all the questions. I really appreciate your time. Thank you for all your questions. And please do you not forget to go to your favorite DSP and listen to Randy Travis and his song, where that came from which was generated with AI, with Randy's permission with his producer, from his entire life, and it's just a wonderful collaboration an example of what is possible with AI. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Robert, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into details of our Q2 results, I want to remind everyone that growth rate comparisons will be in constant currency.\n The items affecting recorded music streaming revenue, comparability, include the BMG digital revenue roll-off, which was $22 million unfavorable in the quarter. Additionally, the renewal with one of our international digital partners that resulted in upfront incremental revenue recognition of $27 million last quarter, resulted in an unfavorable impact of $4 million this quarter and will have a similar impact in Q3 and Q4. Details relating to these items can be found in our earnings press release.\n In Q2, total revenue grew 7% and adjusted OIBDA increased 9% with a margin of 20.9% and an increase of 40 basis points over the prior year quarter. On a normalized basis, total revenue grew 9%, and adjusted OIBDA increased 10%.\n Recorded Music revenue grew 4% and 7% on a normalized basis. Streaming revenue grew 11% on a comparable basis with subscription streaming growth accelerating to 13.5%, while ad supported revenue increased 5%. The improvement in subscription growth was driven by stronger DSP sub performance, along with price increases, partially offset by a deceleration in ad supported revenue, driven by platform mix.\n Physical revenue decreased 7%, driven by the timing of releases. Artist services and expanded rights revenue decreased 3% due to lower merchandising revenue, partially offset by higher concert promotion revenue in France and Japan. Licensing revenue grew 5%, primarily due to the timing of legal settlements. Recorded music adjusted OIBDA increased 9% with a margin of 22.9%, an increase of 110 basis points. On a normalized basis, adjusted OIBDA increased 10%.\n Music Publishing continues to deliver impressive results with revenue growth of 19%, driven by streaming and performance revenue. Digital and streaming revenue increased by 27% and 29%, respectively, reflecting the continued growth in streaming and the impact of digital deal renewals. We also benefited from the continued investment in and expansion of our publishing catalog.\n Performance revenue increased by 18% due to strong artist touring activity in Europe, while sync revenue increased 2%, driven by timing of legal settlements. Mechanical revenue decreased 6% due to lower physical sales. Music Publishing adjusted OIBDA grew 8% with a margin of 26.8%, a decrease of 270 basis points due to revenue mix.\n Turning to CapEx, we saw a $9 million decrease from the prior year quarter to $26 million due to the timing of tech investment. Operating cash flow decreased to a use of $31 million from a use of $6 million in the prior year quarter, due to increased ANR investment and timing of working capital items. Free cash flow decreased to a use of $57 million from a use of $41 million in the prior year quarter. Our goal continues to be to deliver operating cash flow conversion of 50% to 60% over a multiyear period, which we expect to achieve for full year 2024.\n As of March 31, we had a cash balance of $587 million, total debt of $4 billion and net debt of $3.4 billion. Our weighted average cost of debt was 4.5% and our nearest maturity date remains 2028. In February, we announced a plan to deliver $200 million of annualized run rate cost savings by the end of fiscal 2025. The plan is proceeding according to schedule. We achieved modest cost savings in the quarter, the majority of which were reinvested into tech.\n Regarding BMG, we estimate the revenue impact to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million in both Q3 and Q4, eventually rolling off completely in fiscal 2025. As a reminder, BMG's physical distribution will roll off in fiscal 2025. As we look ahead, Q3 is off to a solid start. As Robert mentioned, we are excited about our upcoming releases. The momentum in music in the business is strong, and we continue to position ourselves for long-term success, including to deliver on our goals of healthy top line growth, margin expansion and strong cash flow conversion on a consistent basis. Thank you to everyone for joining us today. We'll now open the call for questions. And Ben, it's Bryan. And just to echo what Robert said on the capital allocation hierarchy, there's really no change there as we've articulated before, and we've walked you through our cascade. We continue to see plenty of runway on organic investment, which you continue to see in our artist signings and ANR investment as well as we continue to expand our publishing and catalog rights. Last year, we acquired 10K, which was a smaller inorganic acquisition. And of course, we also continue to return capital via the dividend to shareholders.\n As Robert said, it's our job to survey the market. And if there's inorganic opportunities that will accelerate our initiatives, we'll take those. But I think we've always demonstrated to be good stewards financially, and we will continue to do that. And I think our interest in Believe was well founded in looking through our capital allocation hierarchy, if it could accelerate it. But again, the unique nature of it led to the outcome. But no change there on capital allocation. Cameron, it's Bryan. Just to maybe break down the quarter a bit, and the overall Recorded Music streaming of 11% on a normalized basis. Within that, I would say 2 or 3 pieces accelerated. You saw subscription at 13.5% versus 12% in the prior quarter. And then while ad supported and emerging combined decelerated, we did see growth and accelerating trend there in the traditional ad supported. Emerging can have some lumpiness based on deal timing, content delivery as well as mix of platforms.\n But again, the underlying strength there in the core subscription streaming and the traditional ad supported and overall, I think you got to look at emerging, while there may be some lumpiness, we still believe it's a growing category. And so it -- over the long term, we expect it to continue to grow. Sure. Thank you. Yes. So we've been working on i,. and it's well progressed, but nothing new to announce on that. On partnership with DSPs, the way we think about this partnerships versus doing it ourselves. The one, I think, unique insight with music is that unlike other forms of creation, it's incredibly ubiquitous. If you're an artist, you want your content to be distributed as widely as possible across as many touch points.\n And therefore, it's very hard to optimize for any individual platform, and try to anchor a superfans relationship in one place because your superfans are across many, many different platforms, which means I think we're naturally set up to be the right place to do this and do it cross-platform. And then we can always partner with the DSPs, but through the offering that we have. But I just think it's the absolutely ubiquitous nature of music. And finding super fans across all of those, but you can't optimize for any single place, any single platform. Therefore, it has to be a controlled solution. Stephen, thanks, Bryan. On margin, and as we say, we remain focused on our three goals of healthy top line, margin expansion, cash flow conversion. We did call out and reiterate the cash flow conversion this quarter, just knowing that Q2 is seasonally a timing -- a quarter where with timing of receivables and payments and deal timing that we do have low cash conversion. And on margin, again, we're -- as we look out over the year, and I think you got to look at that over the course of the year, rather than quarter-to-quarter. There will be lumpiness in margin, again, based on timing slate deals, as well as just internal efficiencies. So we remain focused on it. We don't guide quarter-to-quarter, but I think you can look over the long term and now we're focused on it. Yes. And Stephen, I would just add to that. I mean there's a bit of a double-edged sword there in terms of higher rates, making it more rigorous. I think you're also seeing a maturation or rationalization across buyers in the market, but also that the interest and the pricing, just speaks to the value of music, and I think it's just an attractive space. And so as Robert said, we still see runway there and our ability to invest."

At the request of Warner Music Group, today's call is being recorded for replay purposes. And if you object, you may disconnect at any time. Now I would like to turn today's call over to your host, Mr. Kareem Chin, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin.\nKareem Chin: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Warner Music Group's fiscal first quarter earnings conference call. Please note that our earnings press release, earnings snapshot, and the Form 10-Q are on our website. On today's call, we have our CEO, Robert Kyncl and our CFO, Bryan Castellani who will take you through our results and then will answer your questions.

Information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements contained in our filings with the SEC. And with that, I'll turn it over to Robert.\nRobert Kyncl: Thank you, Karim. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We're moving at velocity to seek the growth opportunities that exist in the music industry today and we see in the future. I'll talk about how the industry is transforming, the unique opportunities here at WMG, and how we're laying the groundwork to propel our growth for the next decade. But first, I'll start with Q1 results. My references to year-over-year growth rates will be in constant currency, and references to normalized revenue and Adjusted OIBDA are adjusted for items that impact comparability. The details of these can be found in our filings and Bryan will provide commentary as well. I'm happy to report that the momentum we saw in the second half of 2023 has not only continued, but accelerated into Q1 with both our recorded music and music publishing segments generating record high quarterly revenue. Total revenue increased 16% and on a normalized basis 11%. Recorded music revenue accelerated to 15% and on a normalized basis revenue grew 9%, streaming grew 11% and subscription streaming increased 12%. These results reflect solid new release and catalog performance, which were supported by DSP price increases. Music publishing continued to deliver impressive results, with revenue growth of 20%, driven by streaming growth of 30%. Total adjusted OIBDA increased 33% or 10% on a normalized basis. I am thrilled with the momentum we're building with recorded music, driven by our ability to deliver great hits across multiple labels and geographies. Recent artist successes and developments include Atlantic's, Jack Harlow, who topped Billboard Hot 100 with his single, Lovin on Me, Warner Records' Kenya Grace, who climbed to number one in the UK. CHER, whose album Christmas debuted at number one on the Billboard Top Holiday Albums chart. Myke Towers, whose recent album went to number one on Spotify's Top Albums Debut for both Global and USA charts. Korean Group Fifty Fifty who had the biggest hit of the year on TikTok with Cupid and King who had the most streamed track of 2023 in India. We are firing on all cylinders across many territories around the globe. We had number one hits by C Gambino in Sweden, Bennett in Denmark, Viktor Sheen in Czech Republic, Cira in Germany, and Smolasty and Doda in Poland, just to name a few. In music publishing, our strong performance and momentum continued with the fifth consecutive quarter of accelerating year-on-year growth. Warner Chappell was named number one Hot 100 publisher on Billboard year-end charts, with its songwriters [indiscernible] number ones on the Hot 100 Hot R&B and Hip-Hop songs and Hot Country Songs charts to name a few. Our songwriters contributed to massive songs, including I Remember Everything by Zach Ryan and Kacey Musgraves and Miley Cyrus' Flowers, which both won Grammys, and First Person Shooter by Drake featuring J. Cole. We're always expanding our publishing roster. Earlier this week we signed a deal with country superstar Morgan Whalen. We recently signed deals with Kenya Grace and with Swedish band BOLAGET, both Warner Music recording artists. We also enter into agreements with GABITO BALLESTEROS, one of the most in-demand Mexican music stars, and with Boef, the most streamed artist in Netherlands in 2023 for Spotify Wrapped. We are in a very unique asset class of our own. The short form nature of music means it's well aligned with the day's discovery and consumption trends, which are driven by the algorithms of the large platforms and user sharing playlists with each other. Music has the highest repeat consumption of any medium. Music is evergreen. You'll still want to go back to your favorite songs 30, 40 years later. And music is easy for fans to create with. Users of the world's largest social media platforms love using music to soundtrack their own content, further increasing the reach, virality, and popularity of our catalog. And as the music business has grown larger, faster, noisier, and more complex, with the marketized distribution creating a flood of content on platforms, the role of large music companies is growing exponentially more relevant. It's harder than ever for anyone artist to break through the clutter. And that's where we come in. We collect and process large volumes of data and make it usable and actionable, driving repeatable results, a task that is very difficult for any individual artist or a small business, because of the resources and skill sets it requires. Our global marketing footprint and expertise, combined with deep technical capabilities to build systems and data insights, enable us to differentiate ourselves in this regard. In fact, looking at the last quarter, songs from the major music label groups represented 94% of the songs on Billboard Hot 100. Additionally, our ability to aggregate large volumes of rights across recorded music and publishing provides individual artists and songwriters with more collective bargaining power when dealing with complex existing and new distributors and technologies. This will be even more crucial in the age of AI, because everyone wants the most popular music of today and an iconic catalog. WMG is a thriving company in a unique and growing industry. We're in a position of strength at a pivotal moment in the music business. And that's the smart time to change, innovate, and lead. Yesterday, we announced the plan to free up more funds to invest in music and accelerate our growth for the next decade. To do that, we have to make thoughtful choices about where we put our people, resources, and capital. We will realize approximately $200 million in annualized cost savings by the end of September 2025, the majority of which will be reinvested into our recorded music and publishing businesses. Our plan includes a reduction of our workforce by 600 employees, or roughly 10%, most of which will relate to our owned and operated media properties, as well as corporate and various support functions. Yesterday, we began exiting these media properties as well as our in-house ad [sales] (ph) function as they operate outside our core responsibilities to our roster. We're in an exclusive process for the potential sale of the news and entertainment websites, Uproxx and HipHopDX, with more to say on that soon. After a thorough exploration of alternatives, we have decided to wind down the podcasting brand Interworld Presents and the social media publisher IMGN. Brian will provide more details on the financial implications of the plan. But I'd like to tell you a little bit more about it and how we'll be using these cost savings to deliver on our three strategic priorities, which are: to grow engagement with music; to increase the value of music; and evolve how we work together. To grow engagement with music, we're signing and developing the most talented artists and songwriters, sharpening our focus on high-growth geographies and vibrant genres, and using our data and insights to help original talents stand out. Look at the great artists that often success stories like Dua Lipa, Jack Harlow, and Zach Bryan. We're also thinking a more holistic approach to the management of our deep and shallow catalog. We're doing the detailed work of priming our entire catalog so it achieves maximum impact on the DSPs. At the same time, we're identifying select albums for targeted campaigns, similar to those we run by Frontline Repertoire. Resetting samples of successful catalog projects include 30th anniversary of Green Day's, Dookie and the 40th anniversary of [Darking] (ph) had stopped making sense, which drove 33% jump in annual revenue across the band's entire catalog. We're expanding our distribution and administration by building scaled and effective infrastructure to efficiently cater to larger and larger volumes of aspiring artists and songwriters. You've heard me say many times that music remains significantly undervalued, especially when compared to video. The most recent step in the right direction came from Spotify. We're pleased they're introducing a new royalty model, which better aligns economics with the quality content that drives engagement. We view this as just the beginning, and we're continually engaged with our partners to drive faster growth. Another lever to increase the value of music is by strengthening our artists' direct relationships with their superfans. We'll accelerate the building of our new products and experiences as it's an area that's relatively untapped and under monetized. Everything we do is in service of our artists and songwriters. And we're evolving how our company is structured in order to maximize our impact on their behalf. In today's global economy, where scale and speed matter, shared services are often the best way to pool our resources and promote best practices. We already made moves in this direction by centralizing our technology, finance, and business development themes last year. At the same time, in a creative industry like ours, instincts, relationships, and subject matter expertise can make all the difference. So we're working hard to find the right balance so that we'll become more efficient, increase operating leverage, and free up more funds to invest in music and tech, which, in turn, will drive further sustainable growth. Above all, we're positioning ourselves to be: first, to be different; and to be exceptional. We look forward to keeping you updated as we make progress. Our amazing roster of artists and songwriters, combined with our strategy to stay several steps ahead of our fast-evolving industry, will enable us to thrive. Q2 is already off to a strong start, and it was great to celebrate all of our wins at the Grammys this past weekend. Fresh off of signing a new deal with Megan Thee Stallion, she skyrocketed to number one on the Billboard Hot 100. This week, we have five of the top 10 artists on the chart, including Jack Harlow, Teddy Swims, Zach Ryan, and Benson Boone. We also have some massive artists dropping later this year, including releases from Cardi B, Coldplay, Sia, Charlie XCX, Gunna and Benson Boone. We're incredibly optimistic about the future of the music industry in general and the Warner Music Group in particular. With a refreshed leadership team that is gelling incredibly well and our significantly upgraded tech capabilities that are starting to drive results, we're laying the building blocks for future success. The music ecosystem is healthy and growing, and we're excited about the industry's continued progress in realizing the true value of music. Now, here's Bryan to walk you through our financial results.\nBryan Castellani: Thank you, Robert, and good morning, everyone. In Q1, we returned a healthy double-digit growth on a recorded and normalized basis, that was underpinned by strength across both recorded music and music publishing. Before I get into details, I want to remind everyone that our references to normalize will adjust for items that impacted year-over-year comparability. The previously disclosed items affecting comparability include the BMG digital revenue roll-off, which was $13 million unfavorable in the quarter, and a catalog licensing agreement extension, which had a favorable impact to recorded music licensing revenue and adjusted OIBDA of $68 million and $67 million, respectively. In addition, there was a renewal with one of our international digital partners that resulted in upfront incremental revenue recognition of $27 million in the quarter. This favorably impacted recorded music streaming revenue. The adjusted OIBDA associated with this renewal was approximately $10 million. The details relating to these items can be found in our earnings press release. In Q1, total revenue grew 16% and adjusted OIBDA increased 33% with a margin of 25.8%, an increase of 330 basis points over the prior year quarter. On a normalized basis, revenue grew 11% and adjusted OIBDA increased 10% with a margin of 22.6%, which was in line with the prior year quarter. Recorded music revenue grew 15% and 9% on a normalized basis. Additionally, streaming revenue grew 11.4% on a normalized basis, an improvement from the 9% we reported last quarter. Subscription streaming revenue grew 14% or 12% on a normalized basis, supported by DSP price increases. Ad-supported revenue increased by 10%, reflecting sequential improvement from traditional formats as well as the impact of the TikTok renewal, which went into effect last quarter. Physical revenue increased 13%, driven by strong releases in the U.S., Japan, and UK, including releases from Prince, Kiyosuke Himuro, and [Share] (ph). Artist services and expanded-rights revenue decreased 4% due to lower merchandising revenue, partially offset by higher concert promotion revenue in France and Japan. Licensing revenue grew by 81%, primarily due to the aforementioned catalog licensing agreement extension, as well as the timing of new licensing deals primarily in the U.S. Recorded music adjusted OIBDA increased 36% with a margin of 28.5%, an increased to 440 basis points. On a normalized basis, adjusted OIBDA increase by 11% with a margin of 24.8%, an increase of 50 basis points. Music publishing continues to deliver strong results with revenue growth of 20%, driven by strength in streaming and performance. Digital revenue and streaming revenue increased by 30% reflecting the continued growth in streaming and the impact of digital deal renewals. Performance revenue increased by 11% due to strong artist touring activity in Europe, while mechanical and sync revenue were flat. Music publishing adjusted OIBDA increased 18% with a margin of 28.3%. Turning to CapEx, we saw an $8 million increase from the prior year quarter to $29 million, due to increased spend in technology. Operating cash flow increased 40% to $293 million from $209 million in the prior year quarter. Operating cash flow conversion was 65% of adjusted OIBDA. Free cash flow increased 40% to $264 million from $188 million in the prior year quarter. The increase in operating cash flow and free cash flow was primarily driven by strong operating performance and timing of a DSP renewal. As of December 31st quarter end, we had a cash balance of $754 million, total debt of $4 billion, and net debt of $3.3 billion. At the end of the quarter, our weighted average cost of debt was 4.6% and our nearest maturity date was 2028. We always look to take advantage of market conditions to optimize our capital structure. To that end, on January 24th, we repriced our term loan, extending its maturity date to 2031 and lowering our go-forward average cost by 25 basis points. As Robert mentioned, we just announced a plan that will enable us to sharpen our focus on core areas of our business and accelerate our go-forward strategy. I will provide an overview of the financial impacts, and you can also refer to the 8-K we filed yesterday for further details. The plan will deliver $200 million of annualized run rate cost savings by the end of fiscal 2025, including benefits associated with our previously disclosed financial transformation initiative. We will allocate a majority of the cost savings to increase investment in our core businesses, as well as new skill sets and tech capabilities. The plan will result in a pre-tax charge of approximately $140 million, which is composed of $85 million in severance costs and a $55 million non-cash impairment charge related to the businesses we are exiting. The net after-tax charge is estimated to be $105 million. For the remainder of fiscal year 2024, the foregone revenue impact to recorded music artist services and expanded rights is estimated to be approximately $45 million, with negligible impact to adjusted OIBDA. Approximately $120 million of the pre-tax charge will be incurred by the end of fiscal 2024, of which, $55 million relates to the previously mentioned non-cash impairment charge. The remaining $65 million will be related to severance costs, which based on the timing of payments, will have a cash impact of $35 million in this fiscal 2024. We believe that our plan will position us to focus on mission-critical areas, bringing up more capital to deploy at the highest return opportunities, ultimately driving shareholder value. As we look ahead and as Robert said, Q2 is off to a solid start. Our Q2 release slate will feature new music from Dua Lipa, Megan Thee Stallion, Sia, Green Day, Benson Boone, Gabby Barrett, Peter Fox, and the Black Keys, among many others. We are excited about albums that we have planned from some of our superstar artists scheduled for later this year as well. Regarding the BMG roll-off, we expect the revenue impact to increase to approximately $25 million in fiscal Q2. This amount will increase to a quarterly run rate of approximately $35 million by Q4, fully rolling off by the end of fiscal 2024 as BMG gradually brings other digital partners in-house. As a reminder, this continuation of BMG's physical distribution will occur by the end of October 2024. In closing, our goal remains to deliver healthy top-line growth, margin expansion, and strong cash flow conversion on a consistent basis. Both the strategic actions we're taking, as well as our stronger release slate will position us favorably to deliver on these objectives in 2024 as well as for the long term. Thank you to everyone for joining us today. We'll now open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kannan Venkateshwar with Barclays. You may proceed.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Thank you. So Rob and Bryan, one for both of you, if you could. If you could help us understand what you would do differently as a result of the new plan you announced? And also you mentioned an increase in music investment. Could you help us scale that and also what that really involves in terms of things that you might change? I mean, does it mean A&R steps up or you invest in over a longer term in different assets? And along the same lines, how should we measure success of the plan? If you could outline that, that would be helpful. Thank you.\nRobert Kyncl: All right, thank you. So, what we're doing is, we're creating a flywheel that starts with efficiency and operating leverage that's helping us grow efficiently and free up more money all along the way. The use of the money is really in two areas, predominantly in music and a little bit in tech to support all of that. In music today, if you look at our deal pipelines, we have quite a lot of opportunities that we can fully materialize, because how we manage our balance sheet, our dividends, we're operating responsibly, and we have a lot more opportunities that today we can effectively afford. So looking at that combined with an investment framework that we've developed which allows us to be even more selective about those opportunities. This is a framework that we developed based on the data that we're collecting from third party -- third parties, our first party data and real time trends, et cetera. And we're being really thoughtful and intentional about where we want to invest. So all of this work is giving us a lot more dry powder to put that in place. And obviously with tech, it's really important that tech is supporting efficient growth of the company and introducing as much automation as possible into our systems and processes, both on the recorded site as well as on the publishing site. It also helps us monetize our entire catalog. I'll give you one small example, which is, when you manage millions of copyrights, that's a lot of metadata, that's a lot of thumbnails on whole bunch of DSPs and freshness of thumbnails or motion art things of that nature help streams, which helps revenue. But it's really difficult to do that manually across such large volume of content. So we developed an AI tool that helps us update it, create new one, et cetera. So there are lots of tricks of this trade that we can deploy with technology to help drive revenue as well. And then there are other new monetization opportunities that we can lean into. So in combination, both of those -- that helps us to be more efficient. And music, we believe, has lots of opportunities, and we're much more intentional about them based on the framework that we develop.\nBryan Castellani: And Kanan, it's Bryan. I would just add, as Robert said, that the charge here is that these efficiencies will add operating leverage and help us drive that flywheel. For 2024, you should expect the impacts to be fairly muted. It will take some time for us to implement and start to ramp the savings. And it's similar on the investment side, that, as Robert said, we'll continue to drive our pipeline of not M&A necessarily, but also A&R and acquisition of catalogs, as well as license of artists. And those take time as well. And those investments, I think, you will start to see in our results. And we'll continue to update on that. But the overriding benefit of this is to add confidence and flexibility to our long-term goals for healthy top line and margin expansion on a consistent basis. And so, I think you'll start to see this ramp in 2025.\nKannan Venkateshwar: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Benjamin Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Thanks. Good morning. Robert, two questions for you, one about sort of the industry and one about your company. On the industry front, over the last year, particularly when you first started, you talked a lot about better aligning incentives between streamers and labels and artists. It feels like a lot happened positively last year in 2023 in that direction, but knowing you, I'm sure you think just getting started. So just wanted to get sort of an update on where your focus areas are in terms of continuing to move that alignment forward to the betterment of the whole industry. And then on the company, there's a lot of change happening at Warner Music, a lot of technology that seems to be getting implemented, particularly in the hands of your creative executives, how is the system handling that? Any stress that has popped up, or do you think there's sort of alignment across the organization as you sort of bring technology and creativity together internally? Thanks a lot.\nRobert Kyncl: Thanks, Ben. So, your first question on the industry and how we're aligning. You're right, a year ago we were just talking about things and today we've got a full round of price increases by all the important DSPs and we have new artist focused models around the actual remuneration of the initial stages as you pointed out. So it's incredible to actually see the progress and what I would say in a fairly short amount of time, because these things are complex and people compete with each other. So it's not easy to orchestrate all of that. And so, I think what you will see is continued progress on that on both sides. I am very focused on this. In my opening remarks, I mentioned that this is one of our three priorities. And for me, it's personally a very, very high priority. I spent a lot of time thinking about it, a lot of time working on it with the team, and a lot of time working on it with our DSP partners. It is important, I think this is one of our very large opportunities, pricing overall is a very, very large opportunity for the industry. And we just need to do it responsibly so that we maintain growth together with our DSP partners, but at the same time, focus on ARPU and expand it. And the way I talk about it is, we should be not only hunting, but we should also be harvesting. And the industry obviously has focused on growth over the last 15 years and was only hunting, and we just need to do both of those things in different markets and be much more intentional about that. The second thing on the company, Ben, you asked about how -- obviously I've refreshed quite a lot of the leadership team. There's lots of other people who joined the company, lots of people left the company and were integrating two cultures, right? Obviously music culture rooted in media and creativity and technology culture rooted in coding and they're quite different. What I can tell you is that, I thought it was going to be a lot harder than it has been for us. And I think -- but the credit for that doesn't go to me, it goes to Max Lousada, Ariel Bardin, the leadership team has really embraced this. And I think generally people speak about -- people from the music industry unfairly in this regard because everybody wants technology to help them. And when you have it at your disposal, it's wonderful. You make smarter decisions, you have better tools for frequency and reach in terms of marketing. You can push through more content through our systems, through our supply chain. And so, if you can have it, you want it. And the team has done an incredible job over the last 10 years, having far less of it. And they still did a great job, but they want the help. So the leadership team has really kicked in, It\u2019s gelling. We have great new processes around all of this. And I'm very, very confident that what I set out to do is already happening. And it will just accrue with each quarter and each year. So, yes, very confident.\nBenjamin Swinburne: Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Michael Morris with Guggenheim Securities. You may proceed.\nMichael Morris: Thank you. Good morning, guys. Two questions, one about your content slate and one about your TikTok relationship. So on the first one, can you talk about how much of the revenue momentum that you saw, particularly in recorded music streaming, was fueled by that improved content performance as opposed to some of the underlying trends like price increases in the industry? And as we look at the fiscal second quarter, should we expect further acceleration in the rate of streaming growth given that you have this robust slate and the comparisons ease a bit? So that's my first question. And then second, on the TikTok relationship, you guys reached an agreement with TikTok. There's a very high profile dispute in the market with one of your peers having taken their content off of the service and not reaching an agreement. So I understand you can't speak about somebody else's deal, but maybe in light of what we're seeing in the market, what gives you confidence that the TikTok deal you did was right for you and your artists, and how is it contributing to your growth at this point? Thank you.\nBryan Castellani: Hey, Michael, it's Brian. I'll take the first part of that just on the acceleration, particularly in recorded music streaming in the quarter. And as you know, there's a lot that goes into that, but certainly price increases contributed, and I think we called that out, but also the stronger slate, particularly year-over-year, came out of Q4 with momentum, some launches in Q1, and as we sit here today, as Robert alluded to, the slate is strong coming into Q2 and we're excited about the back half of the year. So as we've said and it has been a focus for Robert, Max, and the team is consistent pipeline of releases. And that has been showing up in the results. And so we are expecting for that to continue.\nRobert Kyncl: And I guess I'll take the TikTok one. So, yes, as you said, obviously, I don't know the details of their dispute. What I can tell you is, I have a pretty unique experience in this. Obviously, I haven't been on the other side, and having gone through these types of disputes where we have -- where content has come down. And so, I know exactly what both [indiscernible] are feeling. I've gone through all of those feelings multiple times. And it is not great for either side, obviously, because I think everybody wants to consummate a deal. Whatever you read in the press, don't believe it, because you don't know the definitions of any of the words that are there and that is where all the disputes begin. And the thing that I can tell you is that I know both really well and I'm confident that they will at some point find an agreement, because from the YouTube experience, music is incredibly helpful to virality of content, right? People when they're creating content, they love trends, they love music. That's what helps it significantly, makes it better if they soundtrack it. So obviously, that's valuable to a platform. And conversely, TikTok, YouTube, Reels, all of those platforms are obviously helpful to making music popular. We all love that on the music side. And user engagement is great. I spoke about it in my opening, that this is also what makes music great and different from all other forms of media. So there are mutual benefits here and it's just about what is the right fair value exchange. And sometimes you have to go through the price discovery [indiscernible] and that's okay too, because people find out exactly what it is and what it means to them. Obviously, I have an interest in them working it out. I want them to work it out. And I think they're both reasonable people that will find a compromise. But as far as our deal, I'm always very confident in the deals that we do. We don't follow other companies. We don't do carbon copies of other deals. We do our own, which is why we did the one last year. Again, I've had sort of unique experience from both sides to bridge our dissonance. It wasn't easy with TikTok. I think it was very difficult, too. But we got there. And for us, it was fair. But it was a year ago. It was also a different time. So I don't know what is driving Universal's positions. But there's any way we can help them, we will, all of us. And I'm confident they'll sort it out.\nBryan Castellani: And Michael, just to add, I mean, Robert said we're obviously wishing for a collaborative resolution there. But TikTok, as you see our ad-supported revenue growth at 10% in a quarter, TikTok and the deal we executed last quarter certainly contributed to that. So we like our TikTok deal and it continues to be a driver of growth.\nMichael Morris: Thank you, Rob. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Benjamin Black with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.\nBenjamin Black: Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, Robert, could you give us an update on some sort of your thoughts around, perhaps, or maybe the discussion you're having with some of your larger DSPs and their respective moves to more of an artist-centric model? It sounds like you're optimistic for some incremental positive change in near to medium terms, so it'd be great to hear your thoughts on that. And then secondly, on the publishing side of the business, it just continues to outperform. So I'd be curious if you could unpack what's going on there from operational standpoint and how sustainable or durable are the current trends there? Thank you very much.\nRobert Kyncl: Thank you. So, on the DSPs, so our discussions are in early stages, because we first had to develop our frameworks and how we think about the world developing from here. This is one of the reasons also I brought Carletta Higginson into the company. She's a very strong innovator of deal structures, both across publishing and recorded music and doing so in a very collaborative manner, but she knows how to drive significant change. And so, we've been we've been developing this strategy and started to talk to DSPs about it. There are multiple different ways to look at it. Once there are options that provide zero disruption to users and there are some that provide mild ones, and then there are some that provide more radical ones. And the work that we need to do is figure out how we explore them across the spectrum. And what is the best way to roll it out and how to do it in a way that continues to drive growth. Subscribers, more and more people in the [indiscernible] experience, but at the same time optimizes it. And - so none of this should be interpreted as we want to increase pricing dramatically, but then slow down the growth at the same time which is what happened to some other companies. That is not it. Again, I have an experience from the other side to drive growth and I want to maintain that. So I think being thoughtful about what also drives the DSPs is really, really important and that is how we get there. So that's one. So I joined business plans together with them to reach higher levels of growth for both of us. On the publishing side, publishing is an incredible business. It's like -- when you see it from the [indiscernible] outside, when you see it from the inside, it's truly an incredible business and it's really -- it's -- obviously there's the creative component of it, which we do incredibly well. But there's also the administration component of it, which is very tedious, very operational, very scaled and it's finding pennies all around the world and every couch around the world. It's the biggest thing you have to do. And that is also where we can deploy technology to do it better, with higher return, and more skill. And I think Guy and Carianne are dividing their duties incredibly well, an excellent team, leading Warner Chappell, and they've been very, very operational for a long time. So the results are showing up based on that. So I'm confident in their continued performance.\nBenjamin Black: Great. Thank you. Very helpful.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Rich Greenfield with LightShed Partners. You may proceed.\nRich Greenfield: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Robert, part of the TikTok dispute, seems like it's focused around AI. And essentially not -- there's obviously the obvious problem of third-party AI content from outside of things like TikTok being put onto TikTok. But part of this dispute seems to be TikTok actually creating tools and enabling the creation of AI music that would count sort of as part of how they value or decide who gets what payments. And I'm just curious, as you think about your relationship with TikTok, could you just give us your view on sort of how you're dealing with them on AI music and sort of that broader of like, how Warner gets paid relative to the creation of AI music within their platform, if that makes sense?\nRobert Kyncl: So I would actually expand your question a little bit because the issue is not just TikTok. It's TikTok, YouTube, Meta\u2026\nRich Greenfield: Totally fair, totally fair.\nRobert Kyncl: Yes, Correct. It's a -- you're asking question that is obviously -- it's very relevant across all of the platforms, because the reason -- I can't recall which quarter it was, but I basically, at some point I spoke about my prioritization of partners for AI, starting with the platforms. Then the secondary focus would be the generative AI engines, and the third is governments and regulation in that order, because the platforms not only have the GenAI engines, but they are really the place where the content ends up. Like those platforms that I mentioned is where no matter what the engine is, the people will want the views, streams, that's where it's going to end up. So our work is focused on making sure that the rules of the road on those platforms respects copyright. And we have a lot of copyright. Universal has a lot of copyright. Sony has a lot of copyright, and many others, Disney, etc. So it's really important to have clear rules of the road, not only for the first-party content that they're creating with their tools, but even more importantly, for content that's created with other tools that end up there. And I think that's generally the forgotten thing. That is really important, so it has to govern all of that. So that is why there are squarely all of them in my site. And this is something that we have been working on. I can't share any details on this, but it is a very top area of priority. This goes into my second bucket on increase in the value of music. Like this is because copyright has to be respected. The outputs and training on our copyright has to be respected. And eventually the laws will reflect it, but the platforms will run ahead of the laws and it's important that they do the right thing and I think they will. We just need to make sure it's also aligned across all of them, not just one and not the others because then we'll just advantage them. So I can -- there's disputes between, let's say, Universal and TikTok over that, because these are fast-evolving technologies and the ground is shifting.\nRich Greenfield: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Batya Levi with UBS. You may proceed.\nBatya Levi: Great, thank you. A follow-up on the streaming revenue growth side, can you talk about if you have already started to see any change in trends since Spotify implemented the policy change in the beginning of the year. And on ad-supported, how should we think about revenue growth going forward? Are there any changes in the royalty structure that could impact that trend? Thank you.\nBryan Castellani: Batya, thanks. It's Brian. I think you're referring to Spotify's reallocation of roughly the $200 million over five years. Too soon to say. I think that's also going to take some time to wrap up. So we have not seen an impact with that yet. On the ad-supported side, again, you saw we broke it out versus subscription streaming, and it includes the emerging platforms like TikTok. And we continue to see favorable stabilization there in the core ad-supporter piece, excluding the emerging platforms. And so that does tie more closely to the overall marketplace where coming off I think easy weaker comps year-over-year, so we're seeing continued growth of stabilization there as well.\nBatya Levi: Got it. Thank you. one more follow-up if I may. On the pacing of margin expansion through the year, how should we think about that this year as you approach the 100-bibs expansion target? Thank you.\nBryan Castellani: As we had called out earlier in last quarter, our back half, just given the release slate, stronger release slate, we will see our margin expansion tick up through the course of the year in Q3 and Q4.\nBatya Levi: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Sebastiano Petti with JP Morgan. You may proceed.\nSebastiano Petti: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I think Robert, just stepping back for a second, high level multi-year, I guess your thoughts on a multi-year basis, thinking about some of the initiatives you're driving. I think you talked about catalog again today seems to be a priority for you. Some of the changes or the approach to distribution for independence seems like a longer term kind of priority for you as well. How long does that take to manifest itself perhaps in the recorded music streaming metrics? Maybe just how you're thinking about the pacing of that, is there additional implementation or changes from an investment perspective that need to go into that? And then also again, Robert, another one I guess, the hunt and harvest, how are you thinking about the timeline perhaps of maybe some of the segmentation changes perhaps that may occur at the DSP level? Is that going to be bifurcated to some extent between developed markets, emerging markets, and maybe just how you're thinking about that evolving over time. Thank you.\nRobert Kyncl: Perfect. Thank you. So on some of the initiatives, Yes, there are quite a few. They're in flight already. So this is not like something that we're just planning. Like one of the reasons that we decided to step on the pedal and accelerate is because we already started to work on our growth levers months back, and a clear vision on what we need to accomplish. And our teams have started to gel, and this goes actually back to one of the earlier questions to how the team is gelling well together. We have work stream, growth streams across technology and the business and we're focused on those and some of them I think will start yielding results this year already. But think of all of this as continued incremental improvements. That is my goal. That every year from all of these initiatives, we just drive incremental improvement and just stay and forever. But you'll start seeing that this year. And I would say on the distribution front, as you discussed, obviously, first we're focused on efficiencies with our own supply chain. But then, really, distribution is how we externalize that to third parties. So it's the right sequencing of that. And I would say you'll start seeing the results of that over the course of, I don't know, next one to two years. Obviously, on the supply chain internally, that will start to be much faster. And then on the distribution side, it will be on the time frame that I just mentioned. On the DSP hunt and harvest process, so changes like this, if you do them responsibly, usually take nine months, a year to figure out together with partners. And so this is not something where you go and strong arm somebody. You have to work together collaboratively, do lots of analysis, figure out what the business plan is, and that is the right approach. And we've done that several times when I was on the other side. So that is how I think about it. And you have to do it with multiple partners, you have to coordinate. So that is the responsible way to approach it. And I think when you think about the different markets, it is very obvious that dual approach makes sense or discerning approach based on the properties of the market. And I'm glad that some of our partners are already seeing it that way as well, because it is in our mutual interest. So we're just going to do it right and we're going to do it together, and be very methodical and analytical about it together.\nSebastiano Petti: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Kutgun Maral with Evercore ISI. You may proceed.\nKutgun Maral: Great. Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up on the outlook for recorded music ad-supported trends. I think growth accelerated from low single digits two quarters ago to 7% last quarter to now 10%. So clearly encouraging trends. Bryan, you just talked about some continued stabilization in your answer to Batya's question regarding core ad trends. Can we see that improving further given some of your key partners like YouTube are seeing fairly notable improving trends. And on the emerging side, can we still expect to see some benefits from renewals with those partners later this year? Thank you.\nBryan Castellani: Thanks, Kutgun, for the question. On the renewals, we don't necessarily comment on our negotiations with partners. And it's a promising growing platform with the emerging partners, and we'll continue to work with them collaboratively to grow the space. On the ad-supported, again, there, YouTube, Spotify continuing to see favorable trends there in core ad supported. And we would expect that to flow through over time. It does take time and I think we're all seeing a stabilization there, although choppy in places across the ad marketplace, but that stabilization we continue to see and based on their results we would look to see that coming in future quarters as well. Thanks for the question.\nKutgun Maral: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Robert Kyncl for any closing remarks.\nRobert Kyncl: All right. Thank you. Well, what I'd like to say is that, being a year on the job, I feel we're in a very strong position. It's incredible to see the amount of work that we've done preparing ourselves for it. We have a refreshed team. We know what we need to do. We're confident to put it out there publicly and we're going after it. And all of this is truly underpinned by having the right leadership team that gels together really well and amazing teams that we've been in investing into all around or delivering results seeing us having success on the charts with great talent that we signed just a few years ago. It's incredible. So I'm very confident about our continued performance and I have great belief in the team that's here with me, so thank you very much, and we'll talk to you in the quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Robert Kyncl",
            "content": "Thank you, Karim. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We're moving at velocity to seek the growth opportunities that exist in the music industry today and we see in the future. I'll talk about how the industry is transforming, the unique opportunities here at WMG, and how we're laying the groundwork to propel our growth for the next decade. But first, I'll start with Q1 results. My references to year-over-year growth rates will be in constant currency, and references to normalized revenue and Adjusted OIBDA are adjusted for items that impact comparability. The details of these can be found in our filings and Bryan will provide commentary as well. I'm happy to report that the momentum we saw in the second half of 2023 has not only continued, but accelerated into Q1 with both our recorded music and music publishing segments generating record high quarterly revenue. Total revenue increased 16% and on a normalized basis 11%. Recorded music revenue accelerated to 15% and on a normalized basis revenue grew 9%, streaming grew 11% and subscription streaming increased 12%. These results reflect solid new release and catalog performance, which were supported by DSP price increases. Music publishing continued to deliver impressive results, with revenue growth of 20%, driven by streaming growth of 30%. Total adjusted OIBDA increased 33% or 10% on a normalized basis. I am thrilled with the momentum we're building with recorded music, driven by our ability to deliver great hits across multiple labels and geographies. Recent artist successes and developments include Atlantic's, Jack Harlow, who topped Billboard Hot 100 with his single, Lovin on Me, Warner Records' Kenya Grace, who climbed to number one in the UK. CHER, whose album Christmas debuted at number one on the Billboard Top Holiday Albums chart. Myke Towers, whose recent album went to number one on Spotify's Top Albums Debut for both Global and USA charts. Korean Group Fifty Fifty who had the biggest hit of the year on TikTok with Cupid and King who had the most streamed track of 2023 in India. We are firing on all cylinders across many territories around the globe. We had number one hits by C Gambino in Sweden, Bennett in Denmark, Viktor Sheen in Czech Republic, Cira in Germany, and Smolasty and Doda in Poland, just to name a few. In music publishing, our strong performance and momentum continued with the fifth consecutive quarter of accelerating year-on-year growth. Warner Chappell was named number one Hot 100 publisher on Billboard year-end charts, with its songwriters [indiscernible] number ones on the Hot 100 Hot R&B and Hip-Hop songs and Hot Country Songs charts to name a few. Our songwriters contributed to massive songs, including I Remember Everything by Zach Ryan and Kacey Musgraves and Miley Cyrus' Flowers, which both won Grammys, and First Person Shooter by Drake featuring J. Cole. We're always expanding our publishing roster. Earlier this week we signed a deal with country superstar Morgan Whalen. We recently signed deals with Kenya Grace and with Swedish band BOLAGET, both Warner Music recording artists. We also enter into agreements with GABITO BALLESTEROS, one of the most in-demand Mexican music stars, and with Boef, the most streamed artist in Netherlands in 2023 for Spotify Wrapped. We are in a very unique asset class of our own. The short form nature of music means it's well aligned with the day's discovery and consumption trends, which are driven by the algorithms of the large platforms and user sharing playlists with each other. Music has the highest repeat consumption of any medium. Music is evergreen. You'll still want to go back to your favorite songs 30, 40 years later. And music is easy for fans to create with. Users of the world's largest social media platforms love using music to soundtrack their own content, further increasing the reach, virality, and popularity of our catalog. And as the music business has grown larger, faster, noisier, and more complex, with the marketized distribution creating a flood of content on platforms, the role of large music companies is growing exponentially more relevant. It's harder than ever for anyone artist to break through the clutter. And that's where we come in. We collect and process large volumes of data and make it usable and actionable, driving repeatable results, a task that is very difficult for any individual artist or a small business, because of the resources and skill sets it requires. Our global marketing footprint and expertise, combined with deep technical capabilities to build systems and data insights, enable us to differentiate ourselves in this regard. In fact, looking at the last quarter, songs from the major music label groups represented 94% of the songs on Billboard Hot 100. Additionally, our ability to aggregate large volumes of rights across recorded music and publishing provides individual artists and songwriters with more collective bargaining power when dealing with complex existing and new distributors and technologies. This will be even more crucial in the age of AI, because everyone wants the most popular music of today and an iconic catalog. WMG is a thriving company in a unique and growing industry. We're in a position of strength at a pivotal moment in the music business. And that's the smart time to change, innovate, and lead. Yesterday, we announced the plan to free up more funds to invest in music and accelerate our growth for the next decade. To do that, we have to make thoughtful choices about where we put our people, resources, and capital. We will realize approximately $200 million in annualized cost savings by the end of September 2025, the majority of which will be reinvested into our recorded music and publishing businesses. Our plan includes a reduction of our workforce by 600 employees, or roughly 10%, most of which will relate to our owned and operated media properties, as well as corporate and various support functions. Yesterday, we began exiting these media properties as well as our in-house ad [sales] (ph) function as they operate outside our core responsibilities to our roster. We're in an exclusive process for the potential sale of the news and entertainment websites, Uproxx and HipHopDX, with more to say on that soon. After a thorough exploration of alternatives, we have decided to wind down the podcasting brand Interworld Presents and the social media publisher IMGN. Brian will provide more details on the financial implications of the plan. But I'd like to tell you a little bit more about it and how we'll be using these cost savings to deliver on our three strategic priorities, which are: to grow engagement with music; to increase the value of music; and evolve how we work together. To grow engagement with music, we're signing and developing the most talented artists and songwriters, sharpening our focus on high-growth geographies and vibrant genres, and using our data and insights to help original talents stand out. Look at the great artists that often success stories like Dua Lipa, Jack Harlow, and Zach Bryan. We're also thinking a more holistic approach to the management of our deep and shallow catalog. We're doing the detailed work of priming our entire catalog so it achieves maximum impact on the DSPs. At the same time, we're identifying select albums for targeted campaigns, similar to those we run by Frontline Repertoire. Resetting samples of successful catalog projects include 30th anniversary of Green Day's, Dookie and the 40th anniversary of [Darking] (ph) had stopped making sense, which drove 33% jump in annual revenue across the band's entire catalog. We're expanding our distribution and administration by building scaled and effective infrastructure to efficiently cater to larger and larger volumes of aspiring artists and songwriters. You've heard me say many times that music remains significantly undervalued, especially when compared to video. The most recent step in the right direction came from Spotify. We're pleased they're introducing a new royalty model, which better aligns economics with the quality content that drives engagement. We view this as just the beginning, and we're continually engaged with our partners to drive faster growth. Another lever to increase the value of music is by strengthening our artists' direct relationships with their superfans. We'll accelerate the building of our new products and experiences as it's an area that's relatively untapped and under monetized. Everything we do is in service of our artists and songwriters. And we're evolving how our company is structured in order to maximize our impact on their behalf. In today's global economy, where scale and speed matter, shared services are often the best way to pool our resources and promote best practices. We already made moves in this direction by centralizing our technology, finance, and business development themes last year. At the same time, in a creative industry like ours, instincts, relationships, and subject matter expertise can make all the difference. So we're working hard to find the right balance so that we'll become more efficient, increase operating leverage, and free up more funds to invest in music and tech, which, in turn, will drive further sustainable growth. Above all, we're positioning ourselves to be: first, to be different; and to be exceptional. We look forward to keeping you updated as we make progress. Our amazing roster of artists and songwriters, combined with our strategy to stay several steps ahead of our fast-evolving industry, will enable us to thrive. Q2 is already off to a strong start, and it was great to celebrate all of our wins at the Grammys this past weekend. Fresh off of signing a new deal with Megan Thee Stallion, she skyrocketed to number one on the Billboard Hot 100. This week, we have five of the top 10 artists on the chart, including Jack Harlow, Teddy Swims, Zach Ryan, and Benson Boone. We also have some massive artists dropping later this year, including releases from Cardi B, Coldplay, Sia, Charlie XCX, Gunna and Benson Boone. We're incredibly optimistic about the future of the music industry in general and the Warner Music Group in particular. With a refreshed leadership team that is gelling incredibly well and our significantly upgraded tech capabilities that are starting to drive results, we're laying the building blocks for future success. The music ecosystem is healthy and growing, and we're excited about the industry's continued progress in realizing the true value of music. Now, here's Bryan to walk you through our financial results. All right, thank you. So, what we're doing is, we're creating a flywheel that starts with efficiency and operating leverage that's helping us grow efficiently and free up more money all along the way. The use of the money is really in two areas, predominantly in music and a little bit in tech to support all of that. In music today, if you look at our deal pipelines, we have quite a lot of opportunities that we can fully materialize, because how we manage our balance sheet, our dividends, we're operating responsibly, and we have a lot more opportunities that today we can effectively afford. So looking at that combined with an investment framework that we've developed which allows us to be even more selective about those opportunities. This is a framework that we developed based on the data that we're collecting from third party -- third parties, our first party data and real time trends, et cetera. And we're being really thoughtful and intentional about where we want to invest. So all of this work is giving us a lot more dry powder to put that in place. And obviously with tech, it's really important that tech is supporting efficient growth of the company and introducing as much automation as possible into our systems and processes, both on the recorded site as well as on the publishing site. It also helps us monetize our entire catalog. I'll give you one small example, which is, when you manage millions of copyrights, that's a lot of metadata, that's a lot of thumbnails on whole bunch of DSPs and freshness of thumbnails or motion art things of that nature help streams, which helps revenue. But it's really difficult to do that manually across such large volume of content. So we developed an AI tool that helps us update it, create new one, et cetera. So there are lots of tricks of this trade that we can deploy with technology to help drive revenue as well. And then there are other new monetization opportunities that we can lean into. So in combination, both of those -- that helps us to be more efficient. And music, we believe, has lots of opportunities, and we're much more intentional about them based on the framework that we develop. Thanks, Ben. So, your first question on the industry and how we're aligning. You're right, a year ago we were just talking about things and today we've got a full round of price increases by all the important DSPs and we have new artist focused models around the actual remuneration of the initial stages as you pointed out. So it's incredible to actually see the progress and what I would say in a fairly short amount of time, because these things are complex and people compete with each other. So it's not easy to orchestrate all of that. And so, I think what you will see is continued progress on that on both sides. I am very focused on this. In my opening remarks, I mentioned that this is one of our three priorities. And for me, it's personally a very, very high priority. I spent a lot of time thinking about it, a lot of time working on it with the team, and a lot of time working on it with our DSP partners. It is important, I think this is one of our very large opportunities, pricing overall is a very, very large opportunity for the industry. And we just need to do it responsibly so that we maintain growth together with our DSP partners, but at the same time, focus on ARPU and expand it. And the way I talk about it is, we should be not only hunting, but we should also be harvesting. And the industry obviously has focused on growth over the last 15 years and was only hunting, and we just need to do both of those things in different markets and be much more intentional about that. The second thing on the company, Ben, you asked about how -- obviously I've refreshed quite a lot of the leadership team. There's lots of other people who joined the company, lots of people left the company and were integrating two cultures, right? Obviously music culture rooted in media and creativity and technology culture rooted in coding and they're quite different. What I can tell you is that, I thought it was going to be a lot harder than it has been for us. And I think -- but the credit for that doesn't go to me, it goes to Max Lousada, Ariel Bardin, the leadership team has really embraced this. And I think generally people speak about -- people from the music industry unfairly in this regard because everybody wants technology to help them. And when you have it at your disposal, it's wonderful. You make smarter decisions, you have better tools for frequency and reach in terms of marketing. You can push through more content through our systems, through our supply chain. And so, if you can have it, you want it. And the team has done an incredible job over the last 10 years, having far less of it. And they still did a great job, but they want the help. So the leadership team has really kicked in, It's gelling. We have great new processes around all of this. And I'm very, very confident that what I set out to do is already happening. And it will just accrue with each quarter and each year. So, yes, very confident. And I guess I'll take the TikTok one. So, yes, as you said, obviously, I don't know the details of their dispute. What I can tell you is, I have a pretty unique experience in this. Obviously, I haven't been on the other side, and having gone through these types of disputes where we have -- where content has come down. And so, I know exactly what both [indiscernible] are feeling. I've gone through all of those feelings multiple times. And it is not great for either side, obviously, because I think everybody wants to consummate a deal. Whatever you read in the press, don't believe it, because you don't know the definitions of any of the words that are there and that is where all the disputes begin. And the thing that I can tell you is that I know both really well and I'm confident that they will at some point find an agreement, because from the YouTube experience, music is incredibly helpful to virality of content, right? People when they're creating content, they love trends, they love music. That's what helps it significantly, makes it better if they soundtrack it. So obviously, that's valuable to a platform. And conversely, TikTok, YouTube, Reels, all of those platforms are obviously helpful to making music popular. We all love that on the music side. And user engagement is great. I spoke about it in my opening, that this is also what makes music great and different from all other forms of media. So there are mutual benefits here and it's just about what is the right fair value exchange. And sometimes you have to go through the price discovery [indiscernible] and that's okay too, because people find out exactly what it is and what it means to them. Obviously, I have an interest in them working it out. I want them to work it out. And I think they're both reasonable people that will find a compromise. But as far as our deal, I'm always very confident in the deals that we do. We don't follow other companies. We don't do carbon copies of other deals. We do our own, which is why we did the one last year. Again, I've had sort of unique experience from both sides to bridge our dissonance. It wasn't easy with TikTok. I think it was very difficult, too. But we got there. And for us, it was fair. But it was a year ago. It was also a different time. So I don't know what is driving Universal's positions. But there's any way we can help them, we will, all of us. And I'm confident they'll sort it out. Thank you. So, on the DSPs, so our discussions are in early stages, because we first had to develop our frameworks and how we think about the world developing from here. This is one of the reasons also I brought Carletta Higginson into the company. She's a very strong innovator of deal structures, both across publishing and recorded music and doing so in a very collaborative manner, but she knows how to drive significant change. And so, we've been we've been developing this strategy and started to talk to DSPs about it. There are multiple different ways to look at it. Once there are options that provide zero disruption to users and there are some that provide mild ones, and then there are some that provide more radical ones. And the work that we need to do is figure out how we explore them across the spectrum. And what is the best way to roll it out and how to do it in a way that continues to drive growth. Subscribers, more and more people in the [indiscernible] experience, but at the same time optimizes it. And - so none of this should be interpreted as we want to increase pricing dramatically, but then slow down the growth at the same time which is what happened to some other companies. That is not it. Again, I have an experience from the other side to drive growth and I want to maintain that. So I think being thoughtful about what also drives the DSPs is really, really important and that is how we get there. So that's one. So I joined business plans together with them to reach higher levels of growth for both of us. On the publishing side, publishing is an incredible business. It's like -- when you see it from the [indiscernible] outside, when you see it from the inside, it's truly an incredible business and it's really -- it's -- obviously there's the creative component of it, which we do incredibly well. But there's also the administration component of it, which is very tedious, very operational, very scaled and it's finding pennies all around the world and every couch around the world. It's the biggest thing you have to do. And that is also where we can deploy technology to do it better, with higher return, and more skill. And I think Guy and Carianne are dividing their duties incredibly well, an excellent team, leading Warner Chappell, and they've been very, very operational for a long time. So the results are showing up based on that. So I'm confident in their continued performance. So I would actually expand your question a little bit because the issue is not just TikTok. It's TikTok, YouTube, Meta... Yes, Correct. It's a -- you're asking question that is obviously -- it's very relevant across all of the platforms, because the reason -- I can't recall which quarter it was, but I basically, at some point I spoke about my prioritization of partners for AI, starting with the platforms. Then the secondary focus would be the generative AI engines, and the third is governments and regulation in that order, because the platforms not only have the GenAI engines, but they are really the place where the content ends up. Like those platforms that I mentioned is where no matter what the engine is, the people will want the views, streams, that's where it's going to end up. So our work is focused on making sure that the rules of the road on those platforms respects copyright. And we have a lot of copyright. Universal has a lot of copyright. Sony has a lot of copyright, and many others, Disney, etc. So it's really important to have clear rules of the road, not only for the first-party content that they're creating with their tools, but even more importantly, for content that's created with other tools that end up there. And I think that's generally the forgotten thing. That is really important, so it has to govern all of that. So that is why there are squarely all of them in my site. And this is something that we have been working on. I can't share any details on this, but it is a very top area of priority. This goes into my second bucket on increase in the value of music. Like this is because copyright has to be respected. The outputs and training on our copyright has to be respected. And eventually the laws will reflect it, but the platforms will run ahead of the laws and it's important that they do the right thing and I think they will. We just need to make sure it's also aligned across all of them, not just one and not the others because then we'll just advantage them. So I can -- there's disputes between, let's say, Universal and TikTok over that, because these are fast-evolving technologies and the ground is shifting. Perfect. Thank you. So on some of the initiatives, Yes, there are quite a few. They're in flight already. So this is not like something that we're just planning. Like one of the reasons that we decided to step on the pedal and accelerate is because we already started to work on our growth levers months back, and a clear vision on what we need to accomplish. And our teams have started to gel, and this goes actually back to one of the earlier questions to how the team is gelling well together. We have work stream, growth streams across technology and the business and we're focused on those and some of them I think will start yielding results this year already. But think of all of this as continued incremental improvements. That is my goal. That every year from all of these initiatives, we just drive incremental improvement and just stay and forever. But you'll start seeing that this year. And I would say on the distribution front, as you discussed, obviously, first we're focused on efficiencies with our own supply chain. But then, really, distribution is how we externalize that to third parties. So it's the right sequencing of that. And I would say you'll start seeing the results of that over the course of, I don't know, next one to two years. Obviously, on the supply chain internally, that will start to be much faster. And then on the distribution side, it will be on the time frame that I just mentioned. On the DSP hunt and harvest process, so changes like this, if you do them responsibly, usually take nine months, a year to figure out together with partners. And so this is not something where you go and strong arm somebody. You have to work together collaboratively, do lots of analysis, figure out what the business plan is, and that is the right approach. And we've done that several times when I was on the other side. So that is how I think about it. And you have to do it with multiple partners, you have to coordinate. So that is the responsible way to approach it. And I think when you think about the different markets, it is very obvious that dual approach makes sense or discerning approach based on the properties of the market. And I'm glad that some of our partners are already seeing it that way as well, because it is in our mutual interest. So we're just going to do it right and we're going to do it together, and be very methodical and analytical about it together. All right. Thank you. Well, what I'd like to say is that, being a year on the job, I feel we're in a very strong position. It's incredible to see the amount of work that we've done preparing ourselves for it. We have a refreshed team. We know what we need to do. We're confident to put it out there publicly and we're going after it. And all of this is truly underpinned by having the right leadership team that gels together really well and amazing teams that we've been in investing into all around or delivering results seeing us having success on the charts with great talent that we signed just a few years ago. It's incredible. So I'm very confident about our continued performance and I have great belief in the team that's here with me, so thank you very much, and we'll talk to you in the quarter."

            "name": "Bryan Castellani",
            "content": "Thank you, Robert, and good morning, everyone. In Q1, we returned a healthy double-digit growth on a recorded and normalized basis, that was underpinned by strength across both recorded music and music publishing. Before I get into details, I want to remind everyone that our references to normalize will adjust for items that impacted year-over-year comparability. The previously disclosed items affecting comparability include the BMG digital revenue roll-off, which was $13 million unfavorable in the quarter, and a catalog licensing agreement extension, which had a favorable impact to recorded music licensing revenue and adjusted OIBDA of $68 million and $67 million, respectively. In addition, there was a renewal with one of our international digital partners that resulted in upfront incremental revenue recognition of $27 million in the quarter. This favorably impacted recorded music streaming revenue. The adjusted OIBDA associated with this renewal was approximately $10 million. The details relating to these items can be found in our earnings press release. In Q1, total revenue grew 16% and adjusted OIBDA increased 33% with a margin of 25.8%, an increase of 330 basis points over the prior year quarter. On a normalized basis, revenue grew 11% and adjusted OIBDA increased 10% with a margin of 22.6%, which was in line with the prior year quarter. Recorded music revenue grew 15% and 9% on a normalized basis. Additionally, streaming revenue grew 11.4% on a normalized basis, an improvement from the 9% we reported last quarter. Subscription streaming revenue grew 14% or 12% on a normalized basis, supported by DSP price increases. Ad-supported revenue increased by 10%, reflecting sequential improvement from traditional formats as well as the impact of the TikTok renewal, which went into effect last quarter. Physical revenue increased 13%, driven by strong releases in the U.S., Japan, and UK, including releases from Prince, Kiyosuke Himuro, and [Share] (ph). Artist services and expanded-rights revenue decreased 4% due to lower merchandising revenue, partially offset by higher concert promotion revenue in France and Japan. Licensing revenue grew by 81%, primarily due to the aforementioned catalog licensing agreement extension, as well as the timing of new licensing deals primarily in the U.S. Recorded music adjusted OIBDA increased 36% with a margin of 28.5%, an increased to 440 basis points. On a normalized basis, adjusted OIBDA increase by 11% with a margin of 24.8%, an increase of 50 basis points. Music publishing continues to deliver strong results with revenue growth of 20%, driven by strength in streaming and performance. Digital revenue and streaming revenue increased by 30% reflecting the continued growth in streaming and the impact of digital deal renewals. Performance revenue increased by 11% due to strong artist touring activity in Europe, while mechanical and sync revenue were flat. Music publishing adjusted OIBDA increased 18% with a margin of 28.3%. Turning to CapEx, we saw an $8 million increase from the prior year quarter to $29 million, due to increased spend in technology. Operating cash flow increased 40% to $293 million from $209 million in the prior year quarter. Operating cash flow conversion was 65% of adjusted OIBDA. Free cash flow increased 40% to $264 million from $188 million in the prior year quarter. The increase in operating cash flow and free cash flow was primarily driven by strong operating performance and timing of a DSP renewal. As of December 31st quarter end, we had a cash balance of $754 million, total debt of $4 billion, and net debt of $3.3 billion. At the end of the quarter, our weighted average cost of debt was 4.6% and our nearest maturity date was 2028. We always look to take advantage of market conditions to optimize our capital structure. To that end, on January 24th, we repriced our term loan, extending its maturity date to 2031 and lowering our go-forward average cost by 25 basis points. As Robert mentioned, we just announced a plan that will enable us to sharpen our focus on core areas of our business and accelerate our go-forward strategy. I will provide an overview of the financial impacts, and you can also refer to the 8-K we filed yesterday for further details. The plan will deliver $200 million of annualized run rate cost savings by the end of fiscal 2025, including benefits associated with our previously disclosed financial transformation initiative. We will allocate a majority of the cost savings to increase investment in our core businesses, as well as new skill sets and tech capabilities. The plan will result in a pre-tax charge of approximately $140 million, which is composed of $85 million in severance costs and a $55 million non-cash impairment charge related to the businesses we are exiting. The net after-tax charge is estimated to be $105 million. For the remainder of fiscal year 2024, the foregone revenue impact to recorded music artist services and expanded rights is estimated to be approximately $45 million, with negligible impact to adjusted OIBDA. Approximately $120 million of the pre-tax charge will be incurred by the end of fiscal 2024, of which, $55 million relates to the previously mentioned non-cash impairment charge. The remaining $65 million will be related to severance costs, which based on the timing of payments, will have a cash impact of $35 million in this fiscal 2024. We believe that our plan will position us to focus on mission-critical areas, bringing up more capital to deploy at the highest return opportunities, ultimately driving shareholder value. As we look ahead and as Robert said, Q2 is off to a solid start. Our Q2 release slate will feature new music from Dua Lipa, Megan Thee Stallion, Sia, Green Day, Benson Boone, Gabby Barrett, Peter Fox, and the Black Keys, among many others. We are excited about albums that we have planned from some of our superstar artists scheduled for later this year as well. Regarding the BMG roll-off, we expect the revenue impact to increase to approximately $25 million in fiscal Q2. This amount will increase to a quarterly run rate of approximately $35 million by Q4, fully rolling off by the end of fiscal 2024 as BMG gradually brings other digital partners in-house. As a reminder, this continuation of BMG's physical distribution will occur by the end of October 2024. In closing, our goal remains to deliver healthy top-line growth, margin expansion, and strong cash flow conversion on a consistent basis. Both the strategic actions we're taking, as well as our stronger release slate will position us favorably to deliver on these objectives in 2024 as well as for the long term. Thank you to everyone for joining us today. We'll now open the call for questions. And Kanan, it's Bryan. I would just add, as Robert said, that the charge here is that these efficiencies will add operating leverage and help us drive that flywheel. For 2024, you should expect the impacts to be fairly muted. It will take some time for us to implement and start to ramp the savings. And it's similar on the investment side, that, as Robert said, we'll continue to drive our pipeline of not M&A necessarily, but also A&R and acquisition of catalogs, as well as license of artists. And those take time as well. And those investments, I think, you will start to see in our results. And we'll continue to update on that. But the overriding benefit of this is to add confidence and flexibility to our long-term goals for healthy top line and margin expansion on a consistent basis. And so, I think you'll start to see this ramp in 2025. Hey, Michael, it's Brian. I'll take the first part of that just on the acceleration, particularly in recorded music streaming in the quarter. And as you know, there's a lot that goes into that, but certainly price increases contributed, and I think we called that out, but also the stronger slate, particularly year-over-year, came out of Q4 with momentum, some launches in Q1, and as we sit here today, as Robert alluded to, the slate is strong coming into Q2 and we're excited about the back half of the year. So as we've said and it has been a focus for Robert, Max, and the team is consistent pipeline of releases. And that has been showing up in the results. And so we are expecting for that to continue. And Michael, just to add, I mean, Robert said we're obviously wishing for a collaborative resolution there. But TikTok, as you see our ad-supported revenue growth at 10% in a quarter, TikTok and the deal we executed last quarter certainly contributed to that. So we like our TikTok deal and it continues to be a driver of growth. Batya, thanks. It's Brian. I think you're referring to Spotify's reallocation of roughly the $200 million over five years. Too soon to say. I think that's also going to take some time to wrap up. So we have not seen an impact with that yet. On the ad-supported side, again, you saw we broke it out versus subscription streaming, and it includes the emerging platforms like TikTok. And we continue to see favorable stabilization there in the core ad-supporter piece, excluding the emerging platforms. And so that does tie more closely to the overall marketplace where coming off I think easy weaker comps year-over-year, so we're seeing continued growth of stabilization there as well. As we had called out earlier in last quarter, our back half, just given the release slate, stronger release slate, we will see our margin expansion tick up through the course of the year in Q3 and Q4. Thanks, Kutgun, for the question. On the renewals, we don't necessarily comment on our negotiations with partners. And it's a promising growing platform with the emerging partners, and we'll continue to work with them collaboratively to grow the space. On the ad-supported, again, there, YouTube, Spotify continuing to see favorable trends there in core ad supported. And we would expect that to flow through over time. It does take time and I think we're all seeing a stabilization there, although choppy in places across the ad marketplace, but that stabilization we continue to see and based on their results we would look to see that coming in future quarters as well. Thanks for the question."
