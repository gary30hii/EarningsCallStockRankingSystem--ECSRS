For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Rainey Mancini.\nRainey Mancini: Hello. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and other reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges and adjustments disclosed in our press release. All net sales growth numbers are in constant currency. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investors section of our Web site. For clarity, I would like to remind you that references to online sales include sales of our products from our online channel, including Brand.com and third party platforms, as well as estimated sales of our products through our retailer\u2019s websites. During the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question so that we can respond to all of you within the time scheduled for this call. And now I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio.\nFabrizio Freda: Thank you, Rainey and Hello, everyone. Fiscal Year 2020 was truly a year without parallel as we delivered one of our strongest first half on record and navigated with agility through a unprecedented pandemic in the second half. In both of these dramatically different halves, our employees lead with the extraordinary passion, creativity and resiliency. Our hearts continue to be with everyone impacted by COVID-19 and we remain focused on the safety and well being of our employees, their families and consumers. The second half of our fiscal year also marked a period of profound paid, strategic events in the United States highlighted the systemic racial injustice that has plagued our society for far too long. In June, we announced a comprehensive set of commitments to act with urgency on achieving racial equity. We stand in solidarity with our black employees, black consumers and black communities and certainly know black lives matter. Among our many commitments, we are listening and learning to foster stronger internal culture and advocacy and inclusion. We are focusing on talent and opportunity to ensure that we are providing more equitable access to professional development and advancement for our black employees. We are ensuring that the end-to-end creative process accurately and consistently represents the black experience and engages black professionals. We are investing for change through a three year $10 million pledge for the company, our brands, our foundation, employee matching gifts and the Lauder family to support nonprofits and are in the process of making the initial $5 million donation. Since announcing our commitments, we have held 30 town halls with our employees and began to identify gaps in our professional development and advancement opportunity for our existing black talent. We have also engaged a diversity focused recruitment firm and created new diversity recruitment resources. We have commitment to doing more as a live in our company and in our communities. In the last few months, the company and our employees have also made donations and pledges to organization around the world to help limit the spread of COVID-19 and eased the related hardship phase by the communities in which we live and work. We made hand sanitizer for frontline workers, high risk individuals and our employees. The production continues in this date at our facilities in the United States, the United Kingdom, Belgium and Switzerland. Our brands have found meaningful ways to offer support, and Aveda is a shining example, it\u2019s initiative for salon owners and stylists serve to connect the educate, as well as to provide financial and business assistance. By offering a standard payments term, online sales, reopening toolkits and over 1,000 hours of virtual education, Aveda actively assisted its network during this challenging period of salon closures. Turning now to the year's performance. In the first half of fiscal year 2020, sales rose 14% and adjusted EPS climbed to 20%. Our continued outperformance yielded strong global prestige due to share gains. In fact, our gains accelerated in calendar 2019. We were well on our way to a third fiscal year double digit sales and adjusted EPS growth. Despite extensive temporary store closures worldwide in the second half as COVID-19 pandemic took hold, sales fell only 20% and we were profitable as we quickly pivoted to online to capture consumption and adjust our cost structure. Our multiple engines of growth strategy, which has powered our success for over decade, continues to be highly effectively. The company diversified prestige beauty portfolio give us many levers to drive the business. Our robust global skincare portfolio, vibrant online business, a broad exposure to Asia-Pacific are the engines of this moment. And then we enjoyed both strong and growing prestige beauty share and profitability. Across these engines, the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand's performance was magnificent in fiscal year 2020, as it achieved its third consecutive year of double digit sales growth. Impressively, the brand hero franchises of Advanced Night Repair, Revitalizing Supreme, Perfectionist, Re-Nutriv and Micro Essence, all contributed meaningfully to growth. For the fiscal year, skincare performed exceptionally well, Est\u00e9e Lauder, La Mer, Tom Ford, Origins, Darphin and Le Labo drove growth organically, while the category also benefit from the acquisition of Dr. Jart. We delivered excellent performance across subcategories, owning to strong repeat purchase rates, data analytics driven marketing, new social selling strategies developed during COVID-19 and highly desirable innovation. Among the subcategories, demand for watery lotions is soaring as a hydrating step before serums and moisturizers in the new era of self care. Est\u00e9e Lauder Macro Essence, La Mer, The Treatment Lotion, Origins, Dr. Weil Mega Mushroom Treatment Lotion, delivered outstanding growth for the fiscal year and we expect to continue our ability in this compelling subcategory. Beyond watery lotions, our serums in high care subcategories are prospering. For serums, cherished heroes like Est\u00e9e Lauder Advanced Night Repair and innovation from clinic even better line and Est\u00e9e Lauder Perfectionist and the Re-Nutriv franchise bolstered growth in fiscal year 2020. La Mer new Eye Concentrate launched a few months ago has been highly sold as consumers are embracing its lighter texture and new claims. In EMEA, the product was the best seller on La Mer.com in the fourth quarter. Trusted brands like Clinique, flourished online when brick and mortar closed. In the fourth quarter, Clinique US prestige beauty share rose on retailer.com solidifying its number one rank. Sales on Clinique.com were the largest across all our brand sites in the quarter, driven by heroes\u2019 dramatically different moisturizing lotion and moisture surge. Clinique promise to deliver products that are simple, safe and effective for skin is resonating largely online. Our online business surged worldwide in fiscal 2020. It delivered nearly triple digit organic sales growth in the fourth quarter, which is a testament to the capabilities and scale we had built, each our Brand.com, brand boutiques and platforms, such as Tmall and retailer.com doors, contributed meaningfully. On our brand sites, in particular, we deliver nearly 90% organic sales growth globally in the fourth quarter as we increased investments to offer the best high-touch services. We quickly evolved our live chat capability to offer detail. We also announced our virtual try-on to include more categories. We rapidly deployed live streaming first in mainland China and then globally, engaging make up artists, as well as brand ambassadors for tutorials. Our live streams are shoppable, meaning that consumers can make purchases within the event. Across the brands, traffic grew significantly in the fourth quarter and conversion rates rose dramatically. Encouragingly, we saw strong growth in engagement and repeat purchase behaviors. both new and existing consumers shopped our brand sites more frequently, as for example, with Origins and Est\u00e9e Lauder in the United States, reinforcing the great work we are doing to cultivate and retain consumer through this moment. Consumer had discovered new shopping habits online that are enduring and this is true of all ages. Clinique\u2019s live streaming series designed to both entertain and educate led consumer to return more frequently, spend four times longer on site and convert at far higher levels. The brand drew live streaming event with Clinique global ambassador, Emilia Clarke, surpassed the newly elevated conversion levels. Bobbi Brown launched its artistry like never before program in May, offering consumers one-on-one and small group video consultations with national make up artists. These engaging sections range from 15 to 60 minutes with the 30 minute makeup bag makeover sessions is the most popular. Conversion rates are incredibly strong with the high level of units per transaction. Bobbi Brown continues to scale this program globally to meet the increasing demand. This is just one example of the many ways our brands are building community through this challenging moment, and we see this as an exciting evolution of the shopping experience for the future. Aveda, which led our brands by first launching its ingredient glossary earlier in the year is seeing guests we engage with a glossary spend three times more time on avida.com than average. Rather acting on our commitment to ingredient transparency, Clinique, La Mer and Origins, launched the ingredient glossaries in the fourth quarter, and we have more to come in fiscal year 2021. We maintained our strategy focused on key online shopping events throughout the year. Our advanced planning for these events delivered outstanding results. For the 618 midyear shopping festival, the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand sales on Tmall tripled and its sales ranked second among all prestige beauty brands. Our Asia Pacific region delivered superior sales growth in fiscal year 2020. Every category in the region expanded, led by accelerating growth in skincare. Fragrance also accelerated as consumer desire in the region for our portfolio of luxury and artisanal fragrance build. Mainland China performed exceptionally with its sales rising roughly 60% organically in the fourth quarter. Korea and several other markets also grew for the year and for quarter, driving prestige beauty share gains for both periods. In Mainland China, the premium and luxury segments of prestige skincare are booming. In fact, luxury is the primary growth driver for the total category. For this, La Mer is ideally positioned with its heritage, iconic ingredients and superior quality. La Mer is helping to grow the category and the brand shares of prestige skincare is expanding significantly, which is the idea of combination. Desire for our luxury and artisanal fragrances is strong in the region, and we continue to see the growth. In the fourth quarter, we launched Kilian and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle in Mainland China with great initial interest from consumers. In Korea, our fragrance sales soared as Jo Malone London and Tom Ford, grew with our launches of Kilian and Le Labo were also highly sold, collectively driving prestige share gains in the category. With air travels still largely curtailed, we are focused on meeting demand locally across the brick-and-mortar and online channels, as well as in localized destinations of travel retail. Hainan, in particular is prospering as tourists gradually resumes, which partially offset the decline of travel retail in the fourth quarter. As of July, duty-free shopping allowances in Hainan have increased more than three fold, which is further boosting consumption. We continue to strengthen our leadership in the travel retail channel. Innovation is fundamental to our strategy. And even in this unique year, it once a year represented over 25% of sales. It will play a vital role in fiscal year 2021, powering the engines of the moment and the engines of the future. Already out these months are two big launches in skincare. La Mer launched its new concentrate as a potent barrier serum newly advanced with antioxidant power to be a double source of strength against environmental stressors and their aging effects. Est\u00e9e Lauder introduced the breakthrough new generation of its brand icon, Advanced Night Repair. This powerhouse serum still has all the benefits and texture loyal consumers know and love, and now feature innovative new technology. Tested on women of all skin tones, ethnicities, and ages, it now offer the fast growing highly desired benefits of firmness, pore minimization and eight hour antioxidant power on top of its existing wrinkle and uneven skin tone benefits to recruit a younger consumer, while retaining our loyal users globally. Its package is being modernized into a luxurious, recyclable glass bottle that supports our sustainability initiatives. We have excited launches to come from MAC and Clinique in makeup as we anticipate trends on the horizon. Our pipeline in fragrances and hair care is also robust with newness from Jo Malone London and Aveda, among others. Looking ahead, we are confident that we can return to our long-term growth algorithm of 6% to 8% sales growth, 50 basis points of operating margin expansion and double digit earnings per share growth in constant currency after a period of normalization as the impacts of COVID-19 subside. Our citizenship and sustainability goals remains on track. We are also implementing sustainable office practices in mainland China and exploring green energy solutions there. For fiscal year 2021, we are investing in several strategic priorities intended to drive our long-term sustainable growth. Among the priorities are enhancing manufacturing capabilities, expanding online fulfillment capabilities and further funding growth opportunity in Asia Pacific, including our new state-of-art innovation center in Shanghai. While the world continues to confront many unknowns related to the pandemic, certain realities have emerged that have accelerated our strategy. As online has quickly grown, we need to more aggressively adjust our brick-and-mortar footprint and more closely align with how and where the consumer wants to shop. The post COVID business acceleration program we announced to-date is designed to rapidly relocate our resources, enabling us to invest in the greatest opportunities for long-term sustainable growth, like online, skincare, or China. Importantly, this program would also improve the productivity and sustainability of our brand building brick-and-mortar footprint and better position us to make it experiential and omnichannel. Tracey will discuss the program in more detail. In closing, we confidentially bring the strength of the first half and the learnings from the second half with us into a new fiscal year. I want to thank all our employees for your exceptional contributions across the year and most especially the second half, you navigated through an unprecedented period with grace and made us a better company. Now, I will turn the call over to Tracey.\nTracey Travis: Thank you, Fabrizio, and hello everyone. As Fabrizio said, fiscal 2020 was an extreme tale of two halves. At the end of December, we delivered our best half year performance on record. And by the time we closed the year on June 30th, COVID-19 had created the backdrop for our worst second half [performance]. Navigating through this year has certainly been one of the most significant challenges we have faced. Same time we are proud to recognize the incredible compassion and resilience of our employees who continue to support their communities and each other as they also work to both mitigate the business impact of COVID-19 and also drive the recovery of our growth. As a reminder, my commentary today is adjusted for the items that Rainey mentioned at the beginning of the call, and that sales growth numbers are in constant currency. And now for the quarter results. Net sales for the fourth quarter fell 31%, as the majority of our brick and mortar distribution throughout the world was closed for much of the quarter. We rapidly accelerated programs to capture additional growth globally online, resulting in nearly double our online sales year-over-year. As a result, online sales including Retailer.com represented more than 40% of our total sales in the quarter. The December acquisition of Dr. Jart added approximately 3 points to net sales growth. Regarding our regional performance, net sales in Asia-Pacific rose 16%, driven primarily by very strong double digit growth in skincare. Mainland China returned to previous levels of robust double digit growth as brick and mortar retail reopened and online more than doubled on strong 618 midyear shopping festival programs. Nearly every brand and channel rose strong double digits in China. Korea rose mid-single digits while other markets in the region have been slower to recover. Net sales in our Europe, the Middle East and Africa regions fell 39% with all markets declining. Global travel retail, which is primarily reported in EMEA, was hard hit by the 97% drop in international passenger traffic but still managed to decline less than 30% for the quarter supported by strong local tourism within China. Net sales in the Americas declined 54%, reflecting a very difficult environment throughout the region. From a category standpoint, skincare was the most resilient. Net sales grew 3%, driven by continued strong increases from the Est\u00e9e Lauder and La Mer brands in Asia. Skincare sales also benefited from the acquisition of the Dr. Jart brand. Net sales in makeup fell 61%, reflecting the greatest impact of COVID-19 work from home and social distancing guidelines on consumer preferences, particularly in Western markets where makeup is the largest category. Fragrance net sales declined 56%, reflecting the impact of store closures and a shift in consumer preferences from personal colognes to hand wash and home fragrances. Our hair care net sales fell 35%. Most stores and salons were shuttered during the quarter. Our gross margin decreased 840 basis points compared to the fourth quarter last year as we expected. A number of factors contributed to the decline and most were triggered by the impact of COVID-19 on our sales and on our manufacturing locations. Increased obsolescence contributed more than half of the decline as demand for all products, particularly makeup was sharply curtailed by COVID-19. Inefficiencies caused by the temporary shutdown in some of our manufacturing locations and the implementation of social distancing measures reduced capacity and triggered a requirement to recognize these manufacturing costs in the current period rather than when the product is sold. This contributed approximately 210 basis points to the decline. The inventory step up related to the Dr. Jart acquisition increased tariffs and other supply chain impacts made up the remainder of the decline. Operating expenses declined 22%, reflecting the $550 million in cost actions we implemented during the quarter. However, the sudden and dramatic sales decline and the gross margin impacts I just mentioned, resulted in a $228 million operating loss for the quarter. The diluted loss per share of $0.53, including $0.03 of unfavorable currency translation and $0.06 dilution from the acquisition of Dr. Jart. Let me now discuss a few elements of our full year results. Net sales declined 3% in constant currency, reflecting the record performance in the first half, followed by the impact of COVID-19 on the second half. Our distribution mix shift continue to evolve, accelerated by COVID-19. Online sales growth accelerated during the year and continue to outpace other channels. Online, including retailer.com, represented 22% of our total sales during fiscal 2020, a 7 point increase compared to last year. Travel retail delivered strong performance despite the sharp downturn in the second half, and grew high single digits for the year, ending fiscal 2020 at 25% of sales. Department stores globally, including their retailer.com business, represented 31% of fiscal 2020 sales. And North America department stores were 9% of our global sales mix. Our gross margin fell 220 basis points to 75.2%, driven largely by the factors I just described in the fourth quarter. For the full year, the increase in obsolescence comprised about half of the decline. The COVID related manufacturing efficiencies were approximately 50 basis points, and the Dr. Jart acquisition increased tariffs and other supply chain impacts caused the remainder of the decrease. Operating expenses declined $240 million or 3% for the year, reflecting savings from Leading Beauty Forward and our ongoing costs initiatives, as well as the cost containment actions we took in response to COVID-19 in the second half of the fiscal year. Our full year operating margin fell 280 basis points to 14.7%, primarily reflecting the gross margin decline, 40 basis points dilution from the inclusion of Dr. Jart and the deleveraging effect of lower sales. The capabilities we built during this time and the actions we took and are taking should help position us to emerge strongly when the recovery is in full swing. Our effective tax rate for the year was 23.2%, an increase of 200 basis points over the prior year, primarily driven by the geographic mix of earnings. Net earnings declined 24% to $1.5 billion and diluted EPS fell 23% to $4.12. Earnings per share was negatively impacted by $0.04 from currency translation and $0.11 dilution from the acquisition of Dr. Jart. We recorded $1.2 billion after tax or $3.31 per share of impairment charges, primarily related to our makeup brands that were initially challenged by a general slowdown in the overall makeup category and along with certain freestanding retail stores have been further challenged by the impact of COVID-19 on consumer demand. In fiscal 2020, we recorded approximately $68 million after-tax, or $0.19 per share in restructuring and other charges for our Leading Beauty Forward initiative. We remain on track to substantially complete initiatives under the program by the end of fiscal 2021, and we continue to expect annual net benefits of approximately $475 million before taxes. These charges were partially offset by the gain on our minority interest in Dr. Jart and favorable changes in the fair value of contingent consideration. As you have heard, COVID-19 has created a number of disruptions to our business, including accelerating changes in our distribution mix that had been expected to occur over a longer period of time. The post-COVID business acceleration program that we announced today reflects the need to accelerate additional organizational changes during fiscal 2021 to operate more effectively in the post-COVID reality. We expect to close select department store counters and between 10% to 15% of freestanding retail stores, primarily in Europe and North America, while also further supporting the accelerating consumer shift to online shopping. This necessitates commensurate changes in our commercial organizations that will reduce the number of employees by a net range of 1,500 to 2,000, primarily point of sale and support personnel related to those retail locations. While some positions will necessarily be eliminated, we also plan to increase investment in online talent and capabilities, including online consultation by sales associates. We also intend to reinvest a portion of the savings from the program to further build out our online technical capabilities, including accelerating omnichannel capabilities linked to our retail stores and to increase digital media to reach both new and existing consumers. The program is beginning now and we expect to realize results fairly quickly, mostly in the coming two years. We expect to take charges of between $400 million and $500 million through fiscal 2022 and generate savings of $300 million to $400 million before tax by fiscal 2023, a portion of which will be reinvested to drive growth. Moving on to cash flows. Cash generated from operations was slightly below last year at $2.3 billion, reflecting lower net sales, partially offset by call to actions and favorable working capital. We utilized $623 million for capital improvements, primarily supporting our ecommerce capabilities, supply chain improvements and information technology. We eliminated or deferred approximately one third of our planned CapEx, mostly related to retail stores and office space upgrades. We also used $1.04 billion net of cash required to purchase the remaining ownership interest in Dr. Jart. During the year, we borrowed $2.7 billion net of repayments to both fund the acquisition of Dr. Jart and to provide liquidity and flexibility as the COVID-19 impact spread during the second half of the year. We ended the year with $5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $6.1 billion in short and long term debt. Even with these liquidity actions and with lower earnings, we returned $1.4 billion in cash to stockholders during the year via dividends and share repurchase activity. In August, we repaid the remaining outstanding $750 million drawn on our revolver. In the near-term, while we are encouraged by the gradual reopening of markets around the world, it remains difficult to predict the duration of the pandemic, the timing and trajectory of the recovery and the corresponding impact on our business, even while online remains a significant bright spot. Where stores are open, we are seeing traffic return slowly. We are also mindful of the risk of the global recession and a likely slow recovery in employment, as some businesses in Western markets remain closed and many government support measures taper off. Therefore, we are not providing explicit sales and EPS guidance for the full year. However, we can provide you with some underlying assumptions to help at least frame some of your expectations for the year. We do expect to see progressive quarterly sales and profit improvement as retail doors reopen and traffic and travel gradually resumes, assuming no significant second wave occurs. Given this expectation, for the first half of the fiscal year, comparisons to our record performance in the prior first half will be difficult with sales and profit below prior year levels. While online is expected to perform strongly, the momentum for recovery in brick-and-mortar and travel retail will not be realized until later in the second half. Conversely, we expect sales and profit to grow significantly in the second half of the year against a period of considerable COVID impact, particularly in the fourth quarter. The inclusion of six months of incremental sales from the acquisition of Dr. Jart should add about 1 to 2 percentage points to sales growth for the fiscal year. Pricing is expected to add another 2 points of growth. Our manufacturing capacity is back to near normal levels and we expect our gross margin to recover accordingly. We expect to realize the full benefit from Leading Beauty Forward in fiscal 2021, and we will continue to maintain some of the COVID-19 cost controls as we progress through the first half of the year. These savings are expected to give us the flexibility to invest more in digital marketing and advertising to support innovation, recruit new consumers and drive brand awareness, while also supporting our operating margin recovery. Our full year effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23% and net interest expense is expected to be approximately $170 million. Capital expenditures are planned at approximately $900 million as we continue to invest in additional manufacturing and distribution capacity, technology and data analytics, research capabilities and ecommerce to support future growth. And as you saw in press release today, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.48 per share. We also expect to reinstate share repurchases sometime during the year as we gain comfort that the recovery is more sustained. As we are all already halfway through our first quarter, we are more comfortable providing guidance for this quarter. At this time, we expect sales to decline 11% to 12% in constant currency. Sales declines peaked in April and have been gradually improving each month as retail markets around the world reopened for business. The incremental sales from Dr. Jart are expected to add about 2.5 points to growth and currency is expected to be dilutive by approximately 1 point. We expect first quarter EPS of $0.80 to $0.85, reflecting the sales outlook, continued cost containment measures and investment in key growth areas like online, innovation and China. Currency is expect to dilute EPS by $0.01 and Dr. Jart is forecast to dilute EPS by $0.06. We look forward to leveraging the tremendous strengths of our business and driving a strong recovery in the new fiscal year as the market accommodates. Protecting our agility to invest appropriately for both the near term recovery and the long-term opportunities inherent in global prestige beauty is paramount to the strategic actions we are taking to continue to support long-term sustainable growth. On behalf of Fabrizio and The Est\u00e9e Lauder Company's leadership team, we give thanks to all of our employees around the world for their extraordinary efforts to manage during this unprecedented period. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time.\nOperator: The floor is now open for questions [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of Erinn Murphy with Piper Sandler.\nErinn Murphy: I guess my question is for Fabrizio. You've had a lot of success in digital that was really expounded upon this quarter. Have you changed your views on how you view Amazon as a potential beauty partner? And then secondly, as stores are starting to reopen. Can you just talk about how consumers are interacting with stores? Thank you.\nFabrizio Freda: So, not yet. We have not changed our point of view at this point of time on Amazon. We see such a huge long-term sustainable evolution of our online that we want to focus on that. And specifically, I want to explain what's happening online. Our last quarter, our online business was growing at double digits and these included 90% growth on our brand.com. Great work on Retail.com in the 80% plus and also triple digit in our platforms are likely more. This increase, particularly the Brand.com and the platforms is increasing our direct to consumer business, which means increasing our data availability of consumers and increasing our ability to market these consumers. The other thing we are seeing is a dramatic increase in consumer engagement in the world of online. And because of these better engagements, we are driving loyalty and repeat of our hero products like never before. And finally, we really see an increase of exclusivity, meaning the consumers that were really there are buying more exclusively our brands and our brands online. And we see the arrival of new consumers across all age groups, which was not the case in the past where the younger age group was ahead. And now we see really an increase across all ages group. This is a tremendous opportunity and we will stay focused on leveraging this opportunity in the future. The other thing we are doing is investing in creating better omnichannel capability, which brings you -- bridge to your second part of the question, which is what we see in store. We see that brick-and-mortar stores are and will remain very important. But they will need to be linked more whenever possible in omnichannel ways to the online, the consumer expect the full experience and the brick-and-mortar store will need to become even more experiential to attract the right traffic on top of being omnichannel. And so we expect brick-and-mortar to be very important, continue being brand building, but we need as we explained in the prepared remarks to rationalize it, because we need to increase productivity. We need to bring back the productivity level that have been diminished by the COVID situation. And bringing back the productivity will make the brick-and-mortar more sustainable for the long-term and we continue to be an essential part of brand building.\nOperator: The next question will come from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: I was hoping we could talk a little bit about North America and sort of underlying brand\u2019s performance and takeaway, if you will, there. So I think anything you could share I guess one in terms of brand.com performance and then two, the degree to which existing retail inventory, so retail inventory at department stores, as an example and specialty multi, which are redirected to fulfill online orders, such that maybe the shipment numbers that you're recording don't really give us like a full read of how the brands were actually performing during the quarter? Thanks.\nFabrizio Freda: Yes. So, first of all, your first part of the equation in North America our online business has been exceptionally strong, and our brand.com business has been really exceptionally strong. And the penetration of the online business has increased dramatically up to the 40% and so that\u2019s changed. Now a lot of this will be sustainable for the reason I was explaining before. Meaning that retail.com is increasing and there are reason why it would be sustainable, the engagement of the consumers there is increasing. Our brand.com increase in the 90% is sustainable, because we see it from the consumer engagement for the amount of time people spend on our brand.com just to give you a sense, a few data points that the virtual try on that we have added, or the chat with consultants that we have added, or the entertainment activities that we have added in the story explanation of innovation, all of these brought in some brands, and Est\u00e9e Lauder as an example. We have consumer that spent 26 minutes of our site interacting with us. So we see real time of interaction, the time of engagement going-up. So this is -- will make this very sustainable growth over the long-term. And joined with our new technologies will make it probably one of the best consumer experiences overtime in luxury consumer experience, full of experience and our omnichannel capabilities. So that's what's happened now. To be clear, this was in our plans. This was part of our compass. But the COVID-19 has anticipated these trends and the speed of marching of these trends of at least two three years that\u2019s what we have seen. Now, the impact of COVID-19 outbreak, however, is also expected to disrupt the brick and mortar in the near term, is in fact include the store closure in the parent stores, which are happening obviously in the quarter -- last quarter they were closed. In many, many cases, the closure directed by us will also be added in the future as we explained in the post COVID-19 acceleration program. And then we are conscious of the highest level of unemployment and that is affecting consumer sentiment, in total, in general. And we see also these affecting particularly for the time being the make up category. We are managing through this, pivoting towards the online business as I explained, supporting also -- supported by our new understand -- granual understanding of consumer and the biggest availability to data that we can drive and in our post-COVID business acceleration program will, however, accelerate the increased productivity in our freestanding store, in our department stores and should work really to rapidly bring productivity back in the future. Fewer brick and mortar location, which is what's happening there. Now in the short term but also will continue in the medium term will reduce our fixed cost and should have also making the region becoming more profitable with the different mix between online and brick and mortar.\nTracey Travis: And the only thing I'll add Lauren is the brand.com business in North America in the fourth quarter was up almost 70%, and represented about 60% of the mix of business. So it was a very strong performer, as you might well imagine and that to Fabrizio\u2019s point was the case really across all of our markets.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.\nNik Modi: Just a quick clarification. Can you confirm that online margins are [accretive] to the corporate average level? Just clarification. And then Tracey, Fabrizio, I mean, how do we think about this post COVID plan and kind of what you're targeting for like online as a percentage of the overall 7 point increase is quite dramatic. I'm just curious how you're thinking about the evolution over the 24 month period over this program? Thanks.\nFabrizio Freda: I don't know. I can say our online margins are stronger than average. So the development of our online business is accretive to the business that is a fact. And how we are thinking of this? I mean, we are thinking of the continuous growth of the penetration of online in our business. I'm not going to give you a specific number, because there's a lot, has to be written in the future. But as a point of reference, we have today at the level of 40% in the most developed online markets in the world, US, UK, China, and other markets are growing tremendously from a much lower base than these three markets. But in every market, there is a tremendous growth. So the potential is very high. And we will learn more about what this specific landing point could be, but it\u2019s going to be significantly higher than today.\nTracey Travis: So we finished the fiscal year \u201820 at at a 22% online mix, as we said in our prepared remarks. And we would expect online penetration to grow from there, even with the strong growth in the fourth quarter, obviously, with a lot of our brick-and-mortar closed during much of the quarter. We do still expect the higher penetration in fiscal '21 of online on top of what we saw in full year on fiscal '20 with a portion of our brick-and-mortar doors closed. So to Fabrizio's point, the acceleration of online that we are prepared to continue to sustain with all of the programs that we implemented in Q4 and expect to continue along with other capabilities that we're adding in fiscal '21, should continue to sustain a lot of those consumers that perhaps discovered shopping online for the first time, or at least certainly was our record of them for the first time and they continued that practice.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel.\nMark Astrachan: I wanted to ask, so your growth in calendar first half '20 was slightly above what estimated market share for prestige look like, at least estimated by one of your larger peers but also then slightly below the growth from that larger peer, which has been somewhat consistent in recent years. I guess, perhaps talk a bit about the dynamics of that and how you anticipate share trends to progress kind of through your fiscal '21, maybe segment geography and kind of what perhaps has driven some of that under performance like you anticipate for the future and kind of maybe, if we're all wrong, kind of looking at that point that out as well. Thank you.\nFabrizio Freda: I'm not sure I understood completely the way you frame the question. But basically, we are growing global market share and we are in prestige, our -- the global market leader. And the total market share is growing and is growing ahead of our competition in general a global level, because we are focusing on the area of fastest growth and most importantly, we are focusing on the areas of profitable, sustainable long-term growth. And because of this, the total is growth. Now there are areas of the business where because of our historical business model, we are losing market share. In some cases also, we're losing more market share than some of our competitors and those are -- this is specific to the U.S., for example, is an example of this. But there are areas like China, travel retail, Asia, in general, where we are growing and we are growing very fast. So our strategy is not to add our multiple engines of growth to grow all at the same time at any cost. We are trying to put the resources. We have located resources, where there is the highest sustainability and better returns. And in that sense, we really look at the key measure of the global market share. And so that\u2019s answer part of your question. The other part of the equation, how we see this market share develop by quarter. As we explained in our prepared remarks, we see really a gradual improvement of our business quarter-by-quarter during fiscal year '21. We explained, which is our view of the first quarter, the second quarter will be better and the last semester will be really strong. And that's our view of the recovery and this is a reflection of the way the stores will reopen, COVID will hopefully be managed around the world and the market, particularly the consumer sentiment in different part of the world will be reestablished. Where the consumer sentiment is reestablished? Where COVID has allowed the reopening in most of the channels like China, we are seeing tremendous business and tremendous share gain. So is also in the area of consumption in market share was the core of your question. We see a gradual acceleration and recovery over the years in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021. Tracey, maybe you want to add some perspective.\nTracey Travis: No. And obviously, we have not provided guidance for the year for obvious reasons, as we don't know how the recovery will progress or COVID-19 will impact global markets for the fiscal year. But as we think about the second half of the year, because I know we tried to provide you with as much as we were comfortable providing as it relates to the guidance. But if you think about the second half of the year comparable, assuming that there is a gradual recovery and there's no other shock to the system, very comparable to our fiscal 2019 EPS performance. So stronger sales growth, but comparable to our fiscal '19 EPS growth. And that's with obviously the tax rate and the interest expense call outs that I made.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi.\nWendy Nicholson: The first question is on the stores that you will keep open. Can you give us some sense of what that footprint will look like maybe by brand and by geography. And I know those stores, even though they\u2019ve been, the ones that you're closing, they may have been unproductive, but they still have served as great ways to build customer relationships. And they're great branding vehicles and all that kind of good stuff. So how much of the savings from closing those stores do you intend to drop to the bottom line versus reinvest to offset the benefit of that branding presence, if you will, that you had historically? Thank you.\nFabrizio Freda: Let me start and then Tracey may add some. First of all, we are doing what the consumers are telling us they want. So we are following the consumer preferences evolution. And second, we are responding to the decisions of our retail partners, because to be clear there are retailers which are using the number of stores, there are retailers which are closing. And so first of all, we need to reflect what is the reality of the market. Second, we need to reflect what the consumer preferences are. And these will result in closing the stores, which are the least productive. And so the stores that will remain, which is obviously the large majority, these stores would be more productive and will allow us to make these store experiential and in the appropriate cases also multichannel. And these will make these stores not only sustainable for the long-term but will make these stores brand building. While the non-productive stores, which are not working and there is no traffic, frankly, are losing their power of being branded business. But the large majority of the remaining brick and mortar will remain -- will be more productive and will be a fantastic brand building tool that will continue to create the relationships that we have experienced. But the unproductive stores of the world are frankly not very productive relationship to date. And on the contrary, the online, new way to work and particularly the new way of the consumer to engage online, is becoming much more relationship building, much more brand building than ever before. And I think if I had to summarize what is in my opinion the biggest change of COVID-19 that made all the online channel, brand.com, platforms, pure plays, retailer.com, much more brand engaging and so much more fully luxury experiences, thanks to technology than ever before. And so to last part of your question, the savings from these productivity improvement in brick and mortar will be in fact obviously, going to the bottom line but in fact will be invested and will be invested in making the remaining brick-and-mortar store and our online much more brand building, growing faster and continue to create outstanding relationship with our consumers. Now to underestimate the fact that a lot of the strong online growth is in brand.com and platforms. So where we have the data access will also give us much more information, data insights, to manage the consumers and the business better in the future.\nTracey Travis: And the only thing I'll add to that is most of our stores are profitable. We have had a portion of our stores as you have heard us talk about the mix shift we've experienced over the last few years. Some of our stores became more marginally profitable and obviously, COVID-19 accelerated some of them into a loss. As we think about recovery and what to expect in terms of brick-and-mortar recovery, those are stores that now we believe need to close. And as you all know, the deleverage related to some of the fixed costs of freestanding stores when they are not productive is burdensome. And certainly prevents us from being able to invest behind recruiting new consumers from a digital marketing perspective. So those are the stores that we will be taking action on. They were -- on that marginal bubble to begin with and certainly has become loss making now that and we don't expect them to recover from loss making. As it relates to our mix of stores you can imagine as well, clearly, in the more mature markets, like North America and Europe, those are where the bulk of the stores are that we will be addressing. And with the challenges in the makeup category, a number of them are in the makeup area. But they're not just makeup, they do comprise some other locations as well, where mall productivity has declined and/or street productivity has declined but some are freestanding stores.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: So I guess as we met all of that together and fast forward to when your sales do recover to pre-COVID levels. Is it your expectation standing here today that the resulting profitability in margin against those sales will be higher than before just given the productivity and restructuring efforts, and the mix shifts that we're talking about the online and skincare? Or are there reasons to believe that that maybe delayed, given the growth reinvestments you just spoke about and maybe some residual weakness in higher margin channels like travel? I guess, little bit more color as to how you're thinking about all that?\nTracey Travis: So and obviously margin, we don't expect will recover this year. And certainly with the actions that we're taking, we would hope that we could recover back to fiscal \u201819 margins by next fiscal year. But that is just the pattern as we believe in fiscal \u201822 again, all things going smoothly, which has not been the case for last several years. But that in fiscal \u201822 assuming a normal year, we will be back to the margins that we had pre-COVID and would progress from there, as Fabrizio indicated in his prepared remarks, to back to our 6% to 8% top line growth and 50 basis points of margin expansion.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.\nRupesh Parikh: So on the makeup category, I was curious just to get your perspective in terms of how you guys think the makeup recovery could take place from here? And then also, I guess related to that question. I know obsolescence related to makeup was a big headwind on the gross margin line in Q4. So I was just curious whether that headwind would continue into this fiscal year? Thank you.\nTracey Travis: So I'll answer the second portion of that question. We clearly adjusted our demand plans and our forecast to be more in line with the trends that we're seeing in makeup this year, even in the recovery. One of the things that we have seen during COVID-19, there has been even an acceleration from a penetration standpoint of interest in skincare and we certainly expect that to continue next year. We have some great innovation programs behind our makeup brands as well. But we are adjusting our forecast to the level of consumption we expect coming out of fiscal \u201820 and the ramp up through fiscal fiscal \u201821. So we certainly don't expect to see the same level of obsolescence unless there is another complete shutdown of business, we don't expect to see the same level of obsolescence in fiscal \u201821. And then Fabrizio?\nFabrizio Freda: And to the question of when makeup recover. Absolutely, makeup is a category, is coming back. This is -- what we are seeing is the impact of what COVID has created on the consumer sentiment or consumer behaviors, is the result of wearing masks in many parts of the world, which has an impact of lipstick, the result of being in homes and having less interaction and less social interaction between people. And there is also frankly the stress that causes and the situation today in many parts of the world is creating that is conducive, it\u2019d be less to the use of makeup that again is part of the joyful moments and individual moments, more than anything else. And so we expect this to come back, and to come back now, this is now into point of views. From my point of view, the makeup cycle will come back very strongly as soon as consumer sentiment will be back and obviously will be back in the future. We'll see this category booming again and we'll be ready for that. That's exactly the essence of the multiple engines of growth that in this moment is skincare, and there is reason why is skincare. Somebody was asking me if the lipstick index is finished. You all remember the lipstick index concept was that beauty is a resilient category, both in situation of crisis like this one and in particular situation of recession risk, because they are affordable purchases for indulging and taking care of yourself. And consumer really love their routines. Now this has remain exactly true also in this crisis. What has changed is the category, because of COVID is, lipstick was not the right category to indicate that but the resiliency of the overall beauty is still evident and is still vary from market. But the way I answer is the lipstick index has been substituted by the most rising index but the concept of index is still there. This is a very resilient category and makeup will come back when consumer sentiment will come back.\nOperator: The next question will come from the line of Steph Wissink with Jefferies.\nSteph Wissink: Our question relates to trial and discovery. I think, Tracey, you mentioned you have some new launches planned and also, Fabrizio, you talked about some of the emerging technologies, live streaming, virtual try-on that you're using in your online business. Can you talk a little bit about how you think about trial and discovery going forward, whether it's makeup or skincare, and then also just intertwining your comments on data, customer data and data access? Thank you.\nFabrizio Freda: First of all, trial and discovery is going very well. And what is evolving and continue to be very strong is obviously trial and discovery in store is always has always been the key point, and what is evolving in trial and discovery online. And the way this is happening is, first of all, we see and I said this before, we see consumer spending much more time. So the level of engagement, the level of relationship with our online sites is increasing. They spend time and they spend time to discover. Now in terms of trial, we are making a very big new investments in sampling online. So you will go and buy online, for example, now at brand.com, your preferred hero products and then you will receive the samples of what our data suggests that you may like around that when you open your pack at home. And in this way, we see how we are driving trial. We are driving discovery, frankly, stronger than what we've ever been able to do in stores, because the ability to know what people will like based on data together with the ability to interact with people with more time in the online relationship, and to shift to their home, their main purchases allow us to make them try a discover, everything else is just a matter of the techniques that we choose. So this is the moment where I believe trial and discovery can be further enhanced in the luxury business model that we are developing for our future.\nOperator: The next question will come from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse.\nMichael Binetti: I would rather ask you a long-term question, but I want you to clarify one thing that Tracey mentioned. Tracey, I think you said the second half of the year earnings performance will be the same as fiscal second half of '19. And then I think later you said EPS growth would be comparable to fiscal '19. Maybe you could clarify that as I just look back at the model you did about $2.09 in EPS in the second half of '19? I think everybody is probably going to hook models to that comment. So it would help to get a little clarification there. And then I guess, and I do hate to be near term, but it seems like in the first quarter guidance bakes in about 800 basis points of an operating margin contraction. I think you said the gross margin should start to improve. And obviously, with the factories open, you'll see less of the accounting drag there from idle factory overhead accruals. I know, the stores are reopening but the SG&A was down by $0.5 billion in the fourth quarter. It seems like it should still be meaningfully lower year-over-year, even if retail starts to come back online. So I just want to make sure I understand where the pressure is on the margin might be in the first quarter related to what you guided?\nTracey Travis: So let me start with -- again, reiterating the fact we are not giving guidance. So as we try to help you frame the your model for the year, given the fact we're not giving guidance. One of the things to think about as we believe that the second half of the year, we will still be recovering our sales growth but will be more normalized assuming no additional impacts from COVID-19. The way you could think about our second half EPS is similar to our adjusted fiscal '19 EPS in the second half. Again, with the ramp up and acceleration in sales that we expect to see. So that is a way to kind of think about the second half. But again, that depends obviously on a continuation of progress as it relates to the recovery. As it relates to the first quarter, what we said in our prepared remarks is we do expect gross margin to recover. And so when you think about the margin for Q1, one of the things we are doing is investing in advertising. So even with sales down in the quarter, we have a launch of our -- one of our most popular products, Advanced Night Repair and that is, we are supporting with digital advertising, some of the online initiatives as well. We are supporting with additional advertising and other innovation as well. So that is a piece of what's driving some margin deleverage in the first quarter. The other piece is higher shipping costs. So we are still catching up a bit from our plants starting up more slowly as it relates to social distancing, but now ramped up but really catching up on some of the shipping to replenish some of the product that was low on inventory in certain markets. So that is driving a piece of the margin. And then when you think about EPS, we obviously have higher net interest expense. So we have higher interest expense and we have lower interest income, given where rates are today. So the combination of that is also putting some pressure on our EPS in the first quarter. And then the last piece obviously, as I did quote the tax rate, which would be the tax rate we expect to see in the first quarter as well.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: Fabrizio, Tracey, can you help me understand the travel retail performance embedded in the first quarter guidance, now that you have more than half of your quarter through? And just a clarification on those puts and takes that Tracey you just described for the first quarter. So basically, your team is through a lot of the pressures that we saw in the quarter. So if you can help us understand the exit rates on some of these expenses that would great, but the travel would be my first -- my main question?\nTracey Travis: So, I'll start and then let Fabrizio share his perspective on travel retail. There are still travel restrictions. So travel retail is still largely closed in the first quarter. And again, we expect travel retail really to be the slowest to recover. Now again, we are seeing traffic locally in Asia, in particular in China and so that is continuing to pick up. And as Fabrizio addressed some event in his prepared remarks, but we do expect that travel retail will be the slowest to recover. As it relates, again, to the to the first quarter. Relative to the fourth quarter, I guess we'll all add to what I\u2019ve said just previously. We did have some furlough programs in the fourth quarter that also are not repeating in the first quarter. So that is another piece of why the expenses, if you're comparing the fourth quarter to the first quarter, might look a bit higher. So it's the advertising, it's the shipping cost. And we do have some of the furlough programs that we had in the fourth quarter that will not be repeating. Probably for -- when you look at the quarter, and more comparable quarter would be the third quarter of last year relative to our first quarter this year in terms of overall performance.\nFabrizio Freda: And what I will add on travel retail is that, first of all, in the long-term, we believe travel retail will continue to be a very exciting channel. And in this moment, the traffic is at very low. But for example, the conversion of travelers into buyers is increasing dramatically. The Asia is the biggest path to a travel retail globally. And the good news that Asia is going to recover faster than the West, the traveling traffic and the conversion driven by retail. So basically by travel retail online in Asia even stronger saying the rest of the world. So the good news that will overtime mitigate the current lack of traffic in travel retail is that the recovery is starting from Asia, Asia is the biggest and the most interesting travel retail segment. The other important thing to say in travel retail is that in this moment, the number of travel retail also in the last quarter and minus 30% has been better than at least we were afraid of, because of the many closures around the world. And the reason why it's been better, there are some mitigating factors, which are very important. The most important mitigating factor is that -- has been the start of China local internal travel that in many cases is beautifully traveled, like in the Hainan Island And the extraordinary increase of what the Chinese are buying within their local duty free travel is mitigating the lack of very limited international travel. But then you can expect for the long-term when the international travel will be reinstated, these local internal travel will not go away. And so there will be a stronger and even more exciting long term travel retail market to manage in which we are today the market leader. And so there is a lot of long term potential into that and I'm very exciting to see what's happening in Hainan, particularly for the future.\nTracey Travis: And the only thing I will add in terms of quarter four versus quarter one, obviously, being down 30% in sales in Q4 and progressing to down 11% to 12% in Q1. We are seeing obviously a pick up in our brick and mortar business. And so in July in fact, as Fabrizio indicated, we actually had positive sales growth. And that was related to some of the restocking that we saw in the trade for doors that had been closed and are now reopening. So we are seeing positive signs that we will expect to continue to see throughout the first half, even as brick and mortar recovers more slowly than obviously the strength we're seeing continue in online.\nOperator: And we have time for one more question. The final question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America.\nOlivia Tong: First, just a follow-up. Did you just say that July was positive overall or specific to a channel? And then just generally speaking, I wanted to ask about the balance between containing costs and supporting the top line, because it's clear that your investments resonated in the top line in the last couple of years pre-pandemic. So as we think about the timing of you getting back on your long term algorithm clearly with a focus on efficiency. Can you talk about how the organization plans to balance achieving both of those things concurrently? Thanks.\nTracey Travis: So my comment on July was global and it was sales growth. And a lot of that being driven from North America actually in terms of some of the restocking within North America, and still seeing growth obviously in markets like China and Korea, the same markets that had momentum in the fourth quarter or more momentum. But every market is improving a bit as doors reopen and we start to see traffic flow back to stores. But July really was restocking from many of our retailers that had their doors closed, and we're sourcing some of their online sales from their brick and mortar doors.\nFabrizio Freda: In terms of -- so yes, July was positive to the company. But to speak about your second part of the question is the focus on the top line, and we intent to remain a high growth company. So we are really focused on growth but we are focused on profitable growth. And in the short term, we are -- we\u2019ll remain focused cost containment to make sure that we preserve the resources to invest in growth. So the cost containment in our program is never shorter, is always designed to preserve and reallocate resources for investment in long term growth and obviously, to drive profitability at the right level. So that's the way we think about it. And in our compass and our strategic process are very focused in identifying the key areas of growth and the key areas of sustainable profitable growth, and to invest in them over proportionally, and to continuously reallocate resources in these areas, that's what we're talking. And also our refractory program is also designed to give us the flexibility to continue doing that also in the COVID situation despite that we are paying a lot of attention to mitigate the short-term impact of lack of sales with a lot of good action of cost containment. We are really focused on recovery, that\u2019s the key point, is recovery of our top-line that overtime gradually will bring back our profitability and our ability to continue to deliver the kind of EPS and double digit EPS growth that we want want to deliver in the long-term. I'd also would like to close, if this is last question, saying in this COVID crisis, as we try to in every crisis, I truly believe, we are coming out as a better company. And yes, we're focused on the profitability side. This company can go back to being high growth and being high growth with strong profitability, but also is a better company in inclusion, in sustainability, in technology. And all of these together will make us also better employer and stronger loyalty, both of employees and of Europe. And I think that's very important value for the company we are, which our company -- very long-term focus. And I think this crisis has been managing in a way where we remain as long-term focused company and we\u2019ll remain a better company, we\u2019ll be a better company.\nOperator: And that concludes today's question-and-answer session.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Fabrizio Freda",
            "content": "Thank you, Rainey and Hello, everyone. Fiscal Year 2020 was truly a year without parallel as we delivered one of our strongest first half on record and navigated with agility through a unprecedented pandemic in the second half. In both of these dramatically different halves, our employees lead with the extraordinary passion, creativity and resiliency. Our hearts continue to be with everyone impacted by COVID-19 and we remain focused on the safety and well being of our employees, their families and consumers. The second half of our fiscal year also marked a period of profound paid, strategic events in the United States highlighted the systemic racial injustice that has plagued our society for far too long. In June, we announced a comprehensive set of commitments to act with urgency on achieving racial equity. We stand in solidarity with our black employees, black consumers and black communities and certainly know black lives matter. Among our many commitments, we are listening and learning to foster stronger internal culture and advocacy and inclusion. We are focusing on talent and opportunity to ensure that we are providing more equitable access to professional development and advancement for our black employees. We are ensuring that the end-to-end creative process accurately and consistently represents the black experience and engages black professionals. We are investing for change through a three year $10 million pledge for the company, our brands, our foundation, employee matching gifts and the Lauder family to support nonprofits and are in the process of making the initial $5 million donation. Since announcing our commitments, we have held 30 town halls with our employees and began to identify gaps in our professional development and advancement opportunity for our existing black talent. We have also engaged a diversity focused recruitment firm and created new diversity recruitment resources. We have commitment to doing more as a live in our company and in our communities. In the last few months, the company and our employees have also made donations and pledges to organization around the world to help limit the spread of COVID-19 and eased the related hardship phase by the communities in which we live and work. We made hand sanitizer for frontline workers, high risk individuals and our employees. The production continues in this date at our facilities in the United States, the United Kingdom, Belgium and Switzerland. Our brands have found meaningful ways to offer support, and Aveda is a shining example, it's initiative for salon owners and stylists serve to connect the educate, as well as to provide financial and business assistance. By offering a standard payments term, online sales, reopening toolkits and over 1,000 hours of virtual education, Aveda actively assisted its network during this challenging period of salon closures. Turning now to the year's performance. In the first half of fiscal year 2020, sales rose 14% and adjusted EPS climbed to 20%. Our continued outperformance yielded strong global prestige due to share gains. In fact, our gains accelerated in calendar 2019. We were well on our way to a third fiscal year double digit sales and adjusted EPS growth. Despite extensive temporary store closures worldwide in the second half as COVID-19 pandemic took hold, sales fell only 20% and we were profitable as we quickly pivoted to online to capture consumption and adjust our cost structure. Our multiple engines of growth strategy, which has powered our success for over decade, continues to be highly effectively. The company diversified prestige beauty portfolio give us many levers to drive the business. Our robust global skincare portfolio, vibrant online business, a broad exposure to Asia-Pacific are the engines of this moment. And then we enjoyed both strong and growing prestige beauty share and profitability. Across these engines, the Este\u0301e Lauder brand's performance was magnificent in fiscal year 2020, as it achieved its third consecutive year of double digit sales growth. Impressively, the brand hero franchises of Advanced Night Repair, Revitalizing Supreme, Perfectionist, Re-Nutriv and Micro Essence, all contributed meaningfully to growth. For the fiscal year, skincare performed exceptionally well, Este\u0301e Lauder, La Mer, Tom Ford, Origins, Darphin and Le Labo drove growth organically, while the category also benefit from the acquisition of Dr. Jart. We delivered excellent performance across subcategories, owning to strong repeat purchase rates, data analytics driven marketing, new social selling strategies developed during COVID-19 and highly desirable innovation. Among the subcategories, demand for watery lotions is soaring as a hydrating step before serums and moisturizers in the new era of self care. Este\u0301e Lauder Macro Essence, La Mer, The Treatment Lotion, Origins, Dr. Weil Mega Mushroom Treatment Lotion, delivered outstanding growth for the fiscal year and we expect to continue our ability in this compelling subcategory. Beyond watery lotions, our serums in high care subcategories are prospering. For serums, cherished heroes like Este\u0301e Lauder Advanced Night Repair and innovation from clinic even better line and Este\u0301e Lauder Perfectionist and the Re-Nutriv franchise bolstered growth in fiscal year 2020. La Mer new Eye Concentrate launched a few months ago has been highly sold as consumers are embracing its lighter texture and new claims. In EMEA, the product was the best seller on La Mer.com in the fourth quarter. Trusted brands like Clinique, flourished online when brick and mortar closed. In the fourth quarter, Clinique US prestige beauty share rose on retailer.com solidifying its number one rank. Sales on Clinique.com were the largest across all our brand sites in the quarter, driven by heroes' dramatically different moisturizing lotion and moisture surge. Clinique promise to deliver products that are simple, safe and effective for skin is resonating largely online. Our online business surged worldwide in fiscal 2020. It delivered nearly triple digit organic sales growth in the fourth quarter, which is a testament to the capabilities and scale we had built, each our Brand.com, brand boutiques and platforms, such as Tmall and retailer.com doors, contributed meaningfully. On our brand sites, in particular, we deliver nearly 90% organic sales growth globally in the fourth quarter as we increased investments to offer the best high-touch services. We quickly evolved our live chat capability to offer detail. We also announced our virtual try-on to include more categories. We rapidly deployed live streaming first in mainland China and then globally, engaging make up artists, as well as brand ambassadors for tutorials. Our live streams are shoppable, meaning that consumers can make purchases within the event. Across the brands, traffic grew significantly in the fourth quarter and conversion rates rose dramatically. Encouragingly, we saw strong growth in engagement and repeat purchase behaviors. both new and existing consumers shopped our brand sites more frequently, as for example, with Origins and Este\u0301e Lauder in the United States, reinforcing the great work we are doing to cultivate and retain consumer through this moment. Consumer had discovered new shopping habits online that are enduring and this is true of all ages. Clinique's live streaming series designed to both entertain and educate led consumer to return more frequently, spend four times longer on site and convert at far higher levels. The brand drew live streaming event with Clinique global ambassador, Emilia Clarke, surpassed the newly elevated conversion levels. Bobbi Brown launched its artistry like never before program in May, offering consumers one-on-one and small group video consultations with national make up artists. These engaging sections range from 15 to 60 minutes with the 30 minute makeup bag makeover sessions is the most popular. Conversion rates are incredibly strong with the high level of units per transaction. Bobbi Brown continues to scale this program globally to meet the increasing demand. This is just one example of the many ways our brands are building community through this challenging moment, and we see this as an exciting evolution of the shopping experience for the future. Aveda, which led our brands by first launching its ingredient glossary earlier in the year is seeing guests we engage with a glossary spend three times more time on avida.com than average. Rather acting on our commitment to ingredient transparency, Clinique, La Mer and Origins, launched the ingredient glossaries in the fourth quarter, and we have more to come in fiscal year 2021. We maintained our strategy focused on key online shopping events throughout the year. Our advanced planning for these events delivered outstanding results. For the 618 midyear shopping festival, the Este\u0301e Lauder brand sales on Tmall tripled and its sales ranked second among all prestige beauty brands. Our Asia Pacific region delivered superior sales growth in fiscal year 2020. Every category in the region expanded, led by accelerating growth in skincare. Fragrance also accelerated as consumer desire in the region for our portfolio of luxury and artisanal fragrance build. Mainland China performed exceptionally with its sales rising roughly 60% organically in the fourth quarter. Korea and several other markets also grew for the year and for quarter, driving prestige beauty share gains for both periods. In Mainland China, the premium and luxury segments of prestige skincare are booming. In fact, luxury is the primary growth driver for the total category. For this, La Mer is ideally positioned with its heritage, iconic ingredients and superior quality. La Mer is helping to grow the category and the brand shares of prestige skincare is expanding significantly, which is the idea of combination. Desire for our luxury and artisanal fragrances is strong in the region, and we continue to see the growth. In the fourth quarter, we launched Kilian and Fre\u0301de\u0301ric Malle in Mainland China with great initial interest from consumers. In Korea, our fragrance sales soared as Jo Malone London and Tom Ford, grew with our launches of Kilian and Le Labo were also highly sold, collectively driving prestige share gains in the category. With air travels still largely curtailed, we are focused on meeting demand locally across the brick-and-mortar and online channels, as well as in localized destinations of travel retail. Hainan, in particular is prospering as tourists gradually resumes, which partially offset the decline of travel retail in the fourth quarter. As of July, duty-free shopping allowances in Hainan have increased more than three fold, which is further boosting consumption. We continue to strengthen our leadership in the travel retail channel. Innovation is fundamental to our strategy. And even in this unique year, it once a year represented over 25% of sales. It will play a vital role in fiscal year 2021, powering the engines of the moment and the engines of the future. Already out these months are two big launches in skincare. La Mer launched its new concentrate as a potent barrier serum newly advanced with antioxidant power to be a double source of strength against environmental stressors and their aging effects. Este\u0301e Lauder introduced the breakthrough new generation of its brand icon, Advanced Night Repair. This powerhouse serum still has all the benefits and texture loyal consumers know and love, and now feature innovative new technology. Tested on women of all skin tones, ethnicities, and ages, it now offer the fast growing highly desired benefits of firmness, pore minimization and eight hour antioxidant power on top of its existing wrinkle and uneven skin tone benefits to recruit a younger consumer, while retaining our loyal users globally. Its package is being modernized into a luxurious, recyclable glass bottle that supports our sustainability initiatives. We have excited launches to come from MAC and Clinique in makeup as we anticipate trends on the horizon. Our pipeline in fragrances and hair care is also robust with newness from Jo Malone London and Aveda, among others. Looking ahead, we are confident that we can return to our long-term growth algorithm of 6% to 8% sales growth, 50 basis points of operating margin expansion and double digit earnings per share growth in constant currency after a period of normalization as the impacts of COVID-19 subside. Our citizenship and sustainability goals remains on track. We are also implementing sustainable office practices in mainland China and exploring green energy solutions there. For fiscal year 2021, we are investing in several strategic priorities intended to drive our long-term sustainable growth. Among the priorities are enhancing manufacturing capabilities, expanding online fulfillment capabilities and further funding growth opportunity in Asia Pacific, including our new state-of-art innovation center in Shanghai. While the world continues to confront many unknowns related to the pandemic, certain realities have emerged that have accelerated our strategy. As online has quickly grown, we need to more aggressively adjust our brick-and-mortar footprint and more closely align with how and where the consumer wants to shop. The post COVID business acceleration program we announced to-date is designed to rapidly relocate our resources, enabling us to invest in the greatest opportunities for long-term sustainable growth, like online, skincare, or China. Importantly, this program would also improve the productivity and sustainability of our brand building brick-and-mortar footprint and better position us to make it experiential and omnichannel. Tracey will discuss the program in more detail. In closing, we confidentially bring the strength of the first half and the learnings from the second half with us into a new fiscal year. I want to thank all our employees for your exceptional contributions across the year and most especially the second half, you navigated through an unprecedented period with grace and made us a better company. Now, I will turn the call over to Tracey. So, not yet. We have not changed our point of view at this point of time on Amazon. We see such a huge long-term sustainable evolution of our online that we want to focus on that. And specifically, I want to explain what's happening online. Our last quarter, our online business was growing at double digits and these included 90% growth on our brand.com. Great work on Retail.com in the 80% plus and also triple digit in our platforms are likely more. This increase, particularly the Brand.com and the platforms is increasing our direct to consumer business, which means increasing our data availability of consumers and increasing our ability to market these consumers. The other thing we are seeing is a dramatic increase in consumer engagement in the world of online. And because of these better engagements, we are driving loyalty and repeat of our hero products like never before. And finally, we really see an increase of exclusivity, meaning the consumers that were really there are buying more exclusively our brands and our brands online. And we see the arrival of new consumers across all age groups, which was not the case in the past where the younger age group was ahead. And now we see really an increase across all ages group. This is a tremendous opportunity and we will stay focused on leveraging this opportunity in the future. The other thing we are doing is investing in creating better omnichannel capability, which brings you -- bridge to your second part of the question, which is what we see in store. We see that brick-and-mortar stores are and will remain very important. But they will need to be linked more whenever possible in omnichannel ways to the online, the consumer expect the full experience and the brick-and-mortar store will need to become even more experiential to attract the right traffic on top of being omnichannel. And so we expect brick-and-mortar to be very important, continue being brand building, but we need as we explained in the prepared remarks to rationalize it, because we need to increase productivity. We need to bring back the productivity level that have been diminished by the COVID situation. And bringing back the productivity will make the brick-and-mortar more sustainable for the long-term and we continue to be an essential part of brand building. Yes. So, first of all, your first part of the equation in North America our online business has been exceptionally strong, and our brand.com business has been really exceptionally strong. And the penetration of the online business has increased dramatically up to the 40% and so that's changed. Now a lot of this will be sustainable for the reason I was explaining before. Meaning that retail.com is increasing and there are reason why it would be sustainable, the engagement of the consumers there is increasing. Our brand.com increase in the 90% is sustainable, because we see it from the consumer engagement for the amount of time people spend on our brand.com just to give you a sense, a few data points that the virtual try on that we have added, or the chat with consultants that we have added, or the entertainment activities that we have added in the story explanation of innovation, all of these brought in some brands, and Este\u0301e Lauder as an example. We have consumer that spent 26 minutes of our site interacting with us. So we see real time of interaction, the time of engagement going-up. So this is -- will make this very sustainable growth over the long-term. And joined with our new technologies will make it probably one of the best consumer experiences overtime in luxury consumer experience, full of experience and our omnichannel capabilities. So that's what's happened now. To be clear, this was in our plans. This was part of our compass. But the COVID-19 has anticipated these trends and the speed of marching of these trends of at least two three years that's what we have seen. Now, the impact of COVID-19 outbreak, however, is also expected to disrupt the brick and mortar in the near term, is in fact include the store closure in the parent stores, which are happening obviously in the quarter -- last quarter they were closed. In many, many cases, the closure directed by us will also be added in the future as we explained in the post COVID-19 acceleration program. And then we are conscious of the highest level of unemployment and that is affecting consumer sentiment, in total, in general. And we see also these affecting particularly for the time being the make up category. We are managing through this, pivoting towards the online business as I explained, supporting also -- supported by our new understand -- granual understanding of consumer and the biggest availability to data that we can drive and in our post-COVID business acceleration program will, however, accelerate the increased productivity in our freestanding store, in our department stores and should work really to rapidly bring productivity back in the future. Fewer brick and mortar location, which is what's happening there. Now in the short term but also will continue in the medium term will reduce our fixed cost and should have also making the region becoming more profitable with the different mix between online and brick and mortar. I don't know. I can say our online margins are stronger than average. So the development of our online business is accretive to the business that is a fact. And how we are thinking of this? I mean, we are thinking of the continuous growth of the penetration of online in our business. I'm not going to give you a specific number, because there's a lot, has to be written in the future. But as a point of reference, we have today at the level of 40% in the most developed online markets in the world, US, UK, China, and other markets are growing tremendously from a much lower base than these three markets. But in every market, there is a tremendous growth. So the potential is very high. And we will learn more about what this specific landing point could be, but it's going to be significantly higher than today. I'm not sure I understood completely the way you frame the question. But basically, we are growing global market share and we are in prestige, our -- the global market leader. And the total market share is growing and is growing ahead of our competition in general a global level, because we are focusing on the area of fastest growth and most importantly, we are focusing on the areas of profitable, sustainable long-term growth. And because of this, the total is growth. Now there are areas of the business where because of our historical business model, we are losing market share. In some cases also, we're losing more market share than some of our competitors and those are -- this is specific to the U.S., for example, is an example of this. But there are areas like China, travel retail, Asia, in general, where we are growing and we are growing very fast. So our strategy is not to add our multiple engines of growth to grow all at the same time at any cost. We are trying to put the resources. We have located resources, where there is the highest sustainability and better returns. And in that sense, we really look at the key measure of the global market share. And so that's answer part of your question. The other part of the equation, how we see this market share develop by quarter. As we explained in our prepared remarks, we see really a gradual improvement of our business quarter-by-quarter during fiscal year '21. We explained, which is our view of the first quarter, the second quarter will be better and the last semester will be really strong. And that's our view of the recovery and this is a reflection of the way the stores will reopen, COVID will hopefully be managed around the world and the market, particularly the consumer sentiment in different part of the world will be reestablished. Where the consumer sentiment is reestablished? Where COVID has allowed the reopening in most of the channels like China, we are seeing tremendous business and tremendous share gain. So is also in the area of consumption in market share was the core of your question. We see a gradual acceleration and recovery over the years in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021. Tracey, maybe you want to add some perspective. Let me start and then Tracey may add some. First of all, we are doing what the consumers are telling us they want. So we are following the consumer preferences evolution. And second, we are responding to the decisions of our retail partners, because to be clear there are retailers which are using the number of stores, there are retailers which are closing. And so first of all, we need to reflect what is the reality of the market. Second, we need to reflect what the consumer preferences are. And these will result in closing the stores, which are the least productive. And so the stores that will remain, which is obviously the large majority, these stores would be more productive and will allow us to make these store experiential and in the appropriate cases also multichannel. And these will make these stores not only sustainable for the long-term but will make these stores brand building. While the non-productive stores, which are not working and there is no traffic, frankly, are losing their power of being branded business. But the large majority of the remaining brick and mortar will remain -- will be more productive and will be a fantastic brand building tool that will continue to create the relationships that we have experienced. But the unproductive stores of the world are frankly not very productive relationship to date. And on the contrary, the online, new way to work and particularly the new way of the consumer to engage online, is becoming much more relationship building, much more brand building than ever before. And I think if I had to summarize what is in my opinion the biggest change of COVID-19 that made all the online channel, brand.com, platforms, pure plays, retailer.com, much more brand engaging and so much more fully luxury experiences, thanks to technology than ever before. And so to last part of your question, the savings from these productivity improvement in brick and mortar will be in fact obviously, going to the bottom line but in fact will be invested and will be invested in making the remaining brick-and-mortar store and our online much more brand building, growing faster and continue to create outstanding relationship with our consumers. Now to underestimate the fact that a lot of the strong online growth is in brand.com and platforms. So where we have the data access will also give us much more information, data insights, to manage the consumers and the business better in the future. And to the question of when makeup recover. Absolutely, makeup is a category, is coming back. This is -- what we are seeing is the impact of what COVID has created on the consumer sentiment or consumer behaviors, is the result of wearing masks in many parts of the world, which has an impact of lipstick, the result of being in homes and having less interaction and less social interaction between people. And there is also frankly the stress that causes and the situation today in many parts of the world is creating that is conducive, it'd be less to the use of makeup that again is part of the joyful moments and individual moments, more than anything else. And so we expect this to come back, and to come back now, this is now into point of views. From my point of view, the makeup cycle will come back very strongly as soon as consumer sentiment will be back and obviously will be back in the future. We'll see this category booming again and we'll be ready for that. That's exactly the essence of the multiple engines of growth that in this moment is skincare, and there is reason why is skincare. Somebody was asking me if the lipstick index is finished. You all remember the lipstick index concept was that beauty is a resilient category, both in situation of crisis like this one and in particular situation of recession risk, because they are affordable purchases for indulging and taking care of yourself. And consumer really love their routines. Now this has remain exactly true also in this crisis. What has changed is the category, because of COVID is, lipstick was not the right category to indicate that but the resiliency of the overall beauty is still evident and is still vary from market. But the way I answer is the lipstick index has been substituted by the most rising index but the concept of index is still there. This is a very resilient category and makeup will come back when consumer sentiment will come back. First of all, trial and discovery is going very well. And what is evolving and continue to be very strong is obviously trial and discovery in store is always has always been the key point, and what is evolving in trial and discovery online. And the way this is happening is, first of all, we see and I said this before, we see consumer spending much more time. So the level of engagement, the level of relationship with our online sites is increasing. They spend time and they spend time to discover. Now in terms of trial, we are making a very big new investments in sampling online. So you will go and buy online, for example, now at brand.com, your preferred hero products and then you will receive the samples of what our data suggests that you may like around that when you open your pack at home. And in this way, we see how we are driving trial. We are driving discovery, frankly, stronger than what we've ever been able to do in stores, because the ability to know what people will like based on data together with the ability to interact with people with more time in the online relationship, and to shift to their home, their main purchases allow us to make them try a discover, everything else is just a matter of the techniques that we choose. So this is the moment where I believe trial and discovery can be further enhanced in the luxury business model that we are developing for our future. And what I will add on travel retail is that, first of all, in the long-term, we believe travel retail will continue to be a very exciting channel. And in this moment, the traffic is at very low. But for example, the conversion of travelers into buyers is increasing dramatically. The Asia is the biggest path to a travel retail globally. And the good news that Asia is going to recover faster than the West, the traveling traffic and the conversion driven by retail. So basically by travel retail online in Asia even stronger saying the rest of the world. So the good news that will overtime mitigate the current lack of traffic in travel retail is that the recovery is starting from Asia, Asia is the biggest and the most interesting travel retail segment. The other important thing to say in travel retail is that in this moment, the number of travel retail also in the last quarter and minus 30% has been better than at least we were afraid of, because of the many closures around the world. And the reason why it's been better, there are some mitigating factors, which are very important. The most important mitigating factor is that -- has been the start of China local internal travel that in many cases is beautifully traveled, like in the Hainan Island And the extraordinary increase of what the Chinese are buying within their local duty free travel is mitigating the lack of very limited international travel. But then you can expect for the long-term when the international travel will be reinstated, these local internal travel will not go away. And so there will be a stronger and even more exciting long term travel retail market to manage in which we are today the market leader. And so there is a lot of long term potential into that and I'm very exciting to see what's happening in Hainan, particularly for the future. In terms of -- so yes, July was positive to the company. But to speak about your second part of the question is the focus on the top line, and we intent to remain a high growth company. So we are really focused on growth but we are focused on profitable growth. And in the short term, we are -- we'll remain focused cost containment to make sure that we preserve the resources to invest in growth. So the cost containment in our program is never shorter, is always designed to preserve and reallocate resources for investment in long term growth and obviously, to drive profitability at the right level. So that's the way we think about it. And in our compass and our strategic process are very focused in identifying the key areas of growth and the key areas of sustainable profitable growth, and to invest in them over proportionally, and to continuously reallocate resources in these areas, that's what we're talking. And also our refractory program is also designed to give us the flexibility to continue doing that also in the COVID situation despite that we are paying a lot of attention to mitigate the short-term impact of lack of sales with a lot of good action of cost containment. We are really focused on recovery, that's the key point, is recovery of our top-line that overtime gradually will bring back our profitability and our ability to continue to deliver the kind of EPS and double digit EPS growth that we want want to deliver in the long-term. I'd also would like to close, if this is last question, saying in this COVID crisis, as we try to in every crisis, I truly believe, we are coming out as a better company. And yes, we're focused on the profitability side. This company can go back to being high growth and being high growth with strong profitability, but also is a better company in inclusion, in sustainability, in technology. And all of these together will make us also better employer and stronger loyalty, both of employees and of Europe. And I think that's very important value for the company we are, which our company -- very long-term focus. And I think this crisis has been managing in a way where we remain as long-term focused company and we'll remain a better company, we'll be a better company."

            "name": "Tracey Travis",
            "content": "Thank you, Fabrizio, and hello everyone. As Fabrizio said, fiscal 2020 was an extreme tale of two halves. At the end of December, we delivered our best half year performance on record. And by the time we closed the year on June 30th, COVID-19 had created the backdrop for our worst second half [performance]. Navigating through this year has certainly been one of the most significant challenges we have faced. Same time we are proud to recognize the incredible compassion and resilience of our employees who continue to support their communities and each other as they also work to both mitigate the business impact of COVID-19 and also drive the recovery of our growth. As a reminder, my commentary today is adjusted for the items that Rainey mentioned at the beginning of the call, and that sales growth numbers are in constant currency. And now for the quarter results. Net sales for the fourth quarter fell 31%, as the majority of our brick and mortar distribution throughout the world was closed for much of the quarter. We rapidly accelerated programs to capture additional growth globally online, resulting in nearly double our online sales year-over-year. As a result, online sales including Retailer.com represented more than 40% of our total sales in the quarter. The December acquisition of Dr. Jart added approximately 3 points to net sales growth. Regarding our regional performance, net sales in Asia-Pacific rose 16%, driven primarily by very strong double digit growth in skincare. Mainland China returned to previous levels of robust double digit growth as brick and mortar retail reopened and online more than doubled on strong 618 midyear shopping festival programs. Nearly every brand and channel rose strong double digits in China. Korea rose mid-single digits while other markets in the region have been slower to recover. Net sales in our Europe, the Middle East and Africa regions fell 39% with all markets declining. Global travel retail, which is primarily reported in EMEA, was hard hit by the 97% drop in international passenger traffic but still managed to decline less than 30% for the quarter supported by strong local tourism within China. Net sales in the Americas declined 54%, reflecting a very difficult environment throughout the region. From a category standpoint, skincare was the most resilient. Net sales grew 3%, driven by continued strong increases from the Este\u0301e Lauder and La Mer brands in Asia. Skincare sales also benefited from the acquisition of the Dr. Jart brand. Net sales in makeup fell 61%, reflecting the greatest impact of COVID-19 work from home and social distancing guidelines on consumer preferences, particularly in Western markets where makeup is the largest category. Fragrance net sales declined 56%, reflecting the impact of store closures and a shift in consumer preferences from personal colognes to hand wash and home fragrances. Our hair care net sales fell 35%. Most stores and salons were shuttered during the quarter. Our gross margin decreased 840 basis points compared to the fourth quarter last year as we expected. A number of factors contributed to the decline and most were triggered by the impact of COVID-19 on our sales and on our manufacturing locations. Increased obsolescence contributed more than half of the decline as demand for all products, particularly makeup was sharply curtailed by COVID-19. Inefficiencies caused by the temporary shutdown in some of our manufacturing locations and the implementation of social distancing measures reduced capacity and triggered a requirement to recognize these manufacturing costs in the current period rather than when the product is sold. This contributed approximately 210 basis points to the decline. The inventory step up related to the Dr. Jart acquisition increased tariffs and other supply chain impacts made up the remainder of the decline. Operating expenses declined 22%, reflecting the $550 million in cost actions we implemented during the quarter. However, the sudden and dramatic sales decline and the gross margin impacts I just mentioned, resulted in a $228 million operating loss for the quarter. The diluted loss per share of $0.53, including $0.03 of unfavorable currency translation and $0.06 dilution from the acquisition of Dr. Jart. Let me now discuss a few elements of our full year results. Net sales declined 3% in constant currency, reflecting the record performance in the first half, followed by the impact of COVID-19 on the second half. Our distribution mix shift continue to evolve, accelerated by COVID-19. Online sales growth accelerated during the year and continue to outpace other channels. Online, including retailer.com, represented 22% of our total sales during fiscal 2020, a 7 point increase compared to last year. Travel retail delivered strong performance despite the sharp downturn in the second half, and grew high single digits for the year, ending fiscal 2020 at 25% of sales. Department stores globally, including their retailer.com business, represented 31% of fiscal 2020 sales. And North America department stores were 9% of our global sales mix. Our gross margin fell 220 basis points to 75.2%, driven largely by the factors I just described in the fourth quarter. For the full year, the increase in obsolescence comprised about half of the decline. The COVID related manufacturing efficiencies were approximately 50 basis points, and the Dr. Jart acquisition increased tariffs and other supply chain impacts caused the remainder of the decrease. Operating expenses declined $240 million or 3% for the year, reflecting savings from Leading Beauty Forward and our ongoing costs initiatives, as well as the cost containment actions we took in response to COVID-19 in the second half of the fiscal year. Our full year operating margin fell 280 basis points to 14.7%, primarily reflecting the gross margin decline, 40 basis points dilution from the inclusion of Dr. Jart and the deleveraging effect of lower sales. The capabilities we built during this time and the actions we took and are taking should help position us to emerge strongly when the recovery is in full swing. Our effective tax rate for the year was 23.2%, an increase of 200 basis points over the prior year, primarily driven by the geographic mix of earnings. Net earnings declined 24% to $1.5 billion and diluted EPS fell 23% to $4.12. Earnings per share was negatively impacted by $0.04 from currency translation and $0.11 dilution from the acquisition of Dr. Jart. We recorded $1.2 billion after tax or $3.31 per share of impairment charges, primarily related to our makeup brands that were initially challenged by a general slowdown in the overall makeup category and along with certain freestanding retail stores have been further challenged by the impact of COVID-19 on consumer demand. In fiscal 2020, we recorded approximately $68 million after-tax, or $0.19 per share in restructuring and other charges for our Leading Beauty Forward initiative. We remain on track to substantially complete initiatives under the program by the end of fiscal 2021, and we continue to expect annual net benefits of approximately $475 million before taxes. These charges were partially offset by the gain on our minority interest in Dr. Jart and favorable changes in the fair value of contingent consideration. As you have heard, COVID-19 has created a number of disruptions to our business, including accelerating changes in our distribution mix that had been expected to occur over a longer period of time. The post-COVID business acceleration program that we announced today reflects the need to accelerate additional organizational changes during fiscal 2021 to operate more effectively in the post-COVID reality. We expect to close select department store counters and between 10% to 15% of freestanding retail stores, primarily in Europe and North America, while also further supporting the accelerating consumer shift to online shopping. This necessitates commensurate changes in our commercial organizations that will reduce the number of employees by a net range of 1,500 to 2,000, primarily point of sale and support personnel related to those retail locations. While some positions will necessarily be eliminated, we also plan to increase investment in online talent and capabilities, including online consultation by sales associates. We also intend to reinvest a portion of the savings from the program to further build out our online technical capabilities, including accelerating omnichannel capabilities linked to our retail stores and to increase digital media to reach both new and existing consumers. The program is beginning now and we expect to realize results fairly quickly, mostly in the coming two years. We expect to take charges of between $400 million and $500 million through fiscal 2022 and generate savings of $300 million to $400 million before tax by fiscal 2023, a portion of which will be reinvested to drive growth. Moving on to cash flows. Cash generated from operations was slightly below last year at $2.3 billion, reflecting lower net sales, partially offset by call to actions and favorable working capital. We utilized $623 million for capital improvements, primarily supporting our ecommerce capabilities, supply chain improvements and information technology. We eliminated or deferred approximately one third of our planned CapEx, mostly related to retail stores and office space upgrades. We also used $1.04 billion net of cash required to purchase the remaining ownership interest in Dr. Jart. During the year, we borrowed $2.7 billion net of repayments to both fund the acquisition of Dr. Jart and to provide liquidity and flexibility as the COVID-19 impact spread during the second half of the year. We ended the year with $5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $6.1 billion in short and long term debt. Even with these liquidity actions and with lower earnings, we returned $1.4 billion in cash to stockholders during the year via dividends and share repurchase activity. In August, we repaid the remaining outstanding $750 million drawn on our revolver. In the near-term, while we are encouraged by the gradual reopening of markets around the world, it remains difficult to predict the duration of the pandemic, the timing and trajectory of the recovery and the corresponding impact on our business, even while online remains a significant bright spot. Where stores are open, we are seeing traffic return slowly. We are also mindful of the risk of the global recession and a likely slow recovery in employment, as some businesses in Western markets remain closed and many government support measures taper off. Therefore, we are not providing explicit sales and EPS guidance for the full year. However, we can provide you with some underlying assumptions to help at least frame some of your expectations for the year. We do expect to see progressive quarterly sales and profit improvement as retail doors reopen and traffic and travel gradually resumes, assuming no significant second wave occurs. Given this expectation, for the first half of the fiscal year, comparisons to our record performance in the prior first half will be difficult with sales and profit below prior year levels. While online is expected to perform strongly, the momentum for recovery in brick-and-mortar and travel retail will not be realized until later in the second half. Conversely, we expect sales and profit to grow significantly in the second half of the year against a period of considerable COVID impact, particularly in the fourth quarter. The inclusion of six months of incremental sales from the acquisition of Dr. Jart should add about 1 to 2 percentage points to sales growth for the fiscal year. Pricing is expected to add another 2 points of growth. Our manufacturing capacity is back to near normal levels and we expect our gross margin to recover accordingly. We expect to realize the full benefit from Leading Beauty Forward in fiscal 2021, and we will continue to maintain some of the COVID-19 cost controls as we progress through the first half of the year. These savings are expected to give us the flexibility to invest more in digital marketing and advertising to support innovation, recruit new consumers and drive brand awareness, while also supporting our operating margin recovery. Our full year effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23% and net interest expense is expected to be approximately $170 million. Capital expenditures are planned at approximately $900 million as we continue to invest in additional manufacturing and distribution capacity, technology and data analytics, research capabilities and ecommerce to support future growth. And as you saw in press release today, we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.48 per share. We also expect to reinstate share repurchases sometime during the year as we gain comfort that the recovery is more sustained. As we are all already halfway through our first quarter, we are more comfortable providing guidance for this quarter. At this time, we expect sales to decline 11% to 12% in constant currency. Sales declines peaked in April and have been gradually improving each month as retail markets around the world reopened for business. The incremental sales from Dr. Jart are expected to add about 2.5 points to growth and currency is expected to be dilutive by approximately 1 point. We expect first quarter EPS of $0.80 to $0.85, reflecting the sales outlook, continued cost containment measures and investment in key growth areas like online, innovation and China. Currency is expect to dilute EPS by $0.01 and Dr. Jart is forecast to dilute EPS by $0.06. We look forward to leveraging the tremendous strengths of our business and driving a strong recovery in the new fiscal year as the market accommodates. Protecting our agility to invest appropriately for both the near term recovery and the long-term opportunities inherent in global prestige beauty is paramount to the strategic actions we are taking to continue to support long-term sustainable growth. On behalf of Fabrizio and The Este\u0301e Lauder Company's leadership team, we give thanks to all of our employees around the world for their extraordinary efforts to manage during this unprecedented period. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time. And the only thing I'll add Lauren is the brand.com business in North America in the fourth quarter was up almost 70%, and represented about 60% of the mix of business. So it was a very strong performer, as you might well imagine and that to Fabrizio's point was the case really across all of our markets. So we finished the fiscal year \u201820 at at a 22% online mix, as we said in our prepared remarks. And we would expect online penetration to grow from there, even with the strong growth in the fourth quarter, obviously, with a lot of our brick-and-mortar closed during much of the quarter. We do still expect the higher penetration in fiscal '21 of online on top of what we saw in full year on fiscal '20 with a portion of our brick-and-mortar doors closed. So to Fabrizio's point, the acceleration of online that we are prepared to continue to sustain with all of the programs that we implemented in Q4 and expect to continue along with other capabilities that we're adding in fiscal '21, should continue to sustain a lot of those consumers that perhaps discovered shopping online for the first time, or at least certainly was our record of them for the first time and they continued that practice. No. And obviously, we have not provided guidance for the year for obvious reasons, as we don't know how the recovery will progress or COVID-19 will impact global markets for the fiscal year. But as we think about the second half of the year, because I know we tried to provide you with as much as we were comfortable providing as it relates to the guidance. But if you think about the second half of the year comparable, assuming that there is a gradual recovery and there's no other shock to the system, very comparable to our fiscal 2019 EPS performance. So stronger sales growth, but comparable to our fiscal '19 EPS growth. And that's with obviously the tax rate and the interest expense call outs that I made. And the only thing I'll add to that is most of our stores are profitable. We have had a portion of our stores as you have heard us talk about the mix shift we've experienced over the last few years. Some of our stores became more marginally profitable and obviously, COVID-19 accelerated some of them into a loss. As we think about recovery and what to expect in terms of brick-and-mortar recovery, those are stores that now we believe need to close. And as you all know, the deleverage related to some of the fixed costs of freestanding stores when they are not productive is burdensome. And certainly prevents us from being able to invest behind recruiting new consumers from a digital marketing perspective. So those are the stores that we will be taking action on. They were -- on that marginal bubble to begin with and certainly has become loss making now that and we don't expect them to recover from loss making. As it relates to our mix of stores you can imagine as well, clearly, in the more mature markets, like North America and Europe, those are where the bulk of the stores are that we will be addressing. And with the challenges in the makeup category, a number of them are in the makeup area. But they're not just makeup, they do comprise some other locations as well, where mall productivity has declined and/or street productivity has declined but some are freestanding stores. So and obviously margin, we don't expect will recover this year. And certainly with the actions that we're taking, we would hope that we could recover back to fiscal \u201819 margins by next fiscal year. But that is just the pattern as we believe in fiscal \u201822 again, all things going smoothly, which has not been the case for last several years. But that in fiscal \u201822 assuming a normal year, we will be back to the margins that we had pre-COVID and would progress from there, as Fabrizio indicated in his prepared remarks, to back to our 6% to 8% top line growth and 50 basis points of margin expansion. So I'll answer the second portion of that question. We clearly adjusted our demand plans and our forecast to be more in line with the trends that we're seeing in makeup this year, even in the recovery. One of the things that we have seen during COVID-19, there has been even an acceleration from a penetration standpoint of interest in skincare and we certainly expect that to continue next year. We have some great innovation programs behind our makeup brands as well. But we are adjusting our forecast to the level of consumption we expect coming out of fiscal \u201820 and the ramp up through fiscal fiscal \u201821. So we certainly don't expect to see the same level of obsolescence unless there is another complete shutdown of business, we don't expect to see the same level of obsolescence in fiscal \u201821. And then Fabrizio? So let me start with -- again, reiterating the fact we are not giving guidance. So as we try to help you frame the your model for the year, given the fact we're not giving guidance. One of the things to think about as we believe that the second half of the year, we will still be recovering our sales growth but will be more normalized assuming no additional impacts from COVID-19. The way you could think about our second half EPS is similar to our adjusted fiscal '19 EPS in the second half. Again, with the ramp up and acceleration in sales that we expect to see. So that is a way to kind of think about the second half. But again, that depends obviously on a continuation of progress as it relates to the recovery. As it relates to the first quarter, what we said in our prepared remarks is we do expect gross margin to recover. And so when you think about the margin for Q1, one of the things we are doing is investing in advertising. So even with sales down in the quarter, we have a launch of our -- one of our most popular products, Advanced Night Repair and that is, we are supporting with digital advertising, some of the online initiatives as well. We are supporting with additional advertising and other innovation as well. So that is a piece of what's driving some margin deleverage in the first quarter. The other piece is higher shipping costs. So we are still catching up a bit from our plants starting up more slowly as it relates to social distancing, but now ramped up but really catching up on some of the shipping to replenish some of the product that was low on inventory in certain markets. So that is driving a piece of the margin. And then when you think about EPS, we obviously have higher net interest expense. So we have higher interest expense and we have lower interest income, given where rates are today. So the combination of that is also putting some pressure on our EPS in the first quarter. And then the last piece obviously, as I did quote the tax rate, which would be the tax rate we expect to see in the first quarter as well. So, I'll start and then let Fabrizio share his perspective on travel retail. There are still travel restrictions. So travel retail is still largely closed in the first quarter. And again, we expect travel retail really to be the slowest to recover. Now again, we are seeing traffic locally in Asia, in particular in China and so that is continuing to pick up. And as Fabrizio addressed some event in his prepared remarks, but we do expect that travel retail will be the slowest to recover. As it relates, again, to the to the first quarter. Relative to the fourth quarter, I guess we'll all add to what I've said just previously. We did have some furlough programs in the fourth quarter that also are not repeating in the first quarter. So that is another piece of why the expenses, if you're comparing the fourth quarter to the first quarter, might look a bit higher. So it's the advertising, it's the shipping cost. And we do have some of the furlough programs that we had in the fourth quarter that will not be repeating. Probably for -- when you look at the quarter, and more comparable quarter would be the third quarter of last year relative to our first quarter this year in terms of overall performance. And the only thing I will add in terms of quarter four versus quarter one, obviously, being down 30% in sales in Q4 and progressing to down 11% to 12% in Q1. We are seeing obviously a pick up in our brick and mortar business. And so in July in fact, as Fabrizio indicated, we actually had positive sales growth. And that was related to some of the restocking that we saw in the trade for doors that had been closed and are now reopening. So we are seeing positive signs that we will expect to continue to see throughout the first half, even as brick and mortar recovers more slowly than obviously the strength we're seeing continue in online. So my comment on July was global and it was sales growth. And a lot of that being driven from North America actually in terms of some of the restocking within North America, and still seeing growth obviously in markets like China and Korea, the same markets that had momentum in the fourth quarter or more momentum. But every market is improving a bit as doors reopen and we start to see traffic flow back to stores. But July really was restocking from many of our retailers that had their doors closed, and we're sourcing some of their online sales from their brick and mortar doors."

For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Rainey Mancini.\nLaraine Mancini: Thank you. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and other reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements.  To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges and adjustments disclosed in our press release. All net sales growth numbers are in constant currency. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP figures on our press release and on the Investors section of our website. [Operator Instructions].  And now I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio.\nFabrizio Freda: Thank you, Rainey, and hello, everyone. I hope you are in good health during this difficult time as the world confronts COVID-19. My heart goes out to those afflicted, and my deep gratitude goes to everyone around the world who is part of the global relief efforts.  Before I discuss results and our strategies to navigate through this challenging environment, I want to first thank our employees at the Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies. The care and compassion you have shown one another since the outbreak while also balancing new work routines for yourselves and caring for your families has been truly inspiring. Your creativity, a sense of collaboration, have risen to new heights as we have adapted our business from marketing to sales to manufacturing and more. Our employees have truly exemplified our belief in leadership from average share. The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies and some of its charitable foundations have made donations to help limit the spread of the virus and ease the related hardships faced by those it affected. To date, we have made donations and commitments to Doctors Without Borders, the New York City COVID-19 Response and Impact Fund, Red Cross Society of China, Shanghai Charity Foundation, Give2Asia and Community Chest of Korea.  This week, we established the ELC Care Employee Relief Fund, our newest giving initiative, which will be funded through our contributions from the company, the Lauder family and our employees. It will provide immediate and critical financial release to employees whose lives have been impacted by the pandemic.  Our brands have also found meaningful ways to contribute. The Est\u00e9e Lauder brand donated 2 million surgical masks for frontline workers in New York, while Clinique donated 50,000 skin care products to doctor and nurses in New York City's hospitals. Aveda launched Aveda Cares, a relief program to benefit independent salons and stylists in the United States. The multifacet initiative will help salons prepare to recover from COVID-19-related closures. The M.A.C VIVA GLAM Fund is continuing its decades-long giving by allocating $10 million to 250 local organization all over the world that are providing essential needs and services to people at higher risk during the COVID-19 pandemic.  I'm also especially proud of how the company mobilized to manufacture hand sanitizer for frontline workers, high-risk individuals and our employees, thanks to the tremendous work of our global research development and supply chains teams. Our facility in the United States, the United Kingdom and Belgium are making over 1 million hand sanitizers.  Now turning to the quarter's performance. As we discussed with you on our last earnings call in early February, we expected third quarter sales to decline. After a strong January globally, we anticipated pressure in February and March in our Asia/Pacific region and our travel retail channel, given the extent of the COVID-19 outbreak at that point in time. However, COVID-19 continued to spread around the world as the quarter progressed, and social distancing measures began to impact retail traffic. As March evolved, travel was significantly curtailed and virtually all stores in the Americas and Europe, the Middle East and Africa temporarily closed, hindering consumer's primary access to supply such that the magnitude of the impact on our business was far greater than initially anticipated.  In this very complex challenging environment, reported sales fell 9% in constant currency. Tracy will provide more details about our financial performance in a moment. In this volatile quarter, there were several bright spots in our business, which led to global prestige beauty share expansion. The Est\u00e9e Lauder brand grew high single digits while DECIEM and Le Labo also delivered sales growth. Skincare sales grew internationally, including Dr. Jart+.  In our Asia/Pacific region, sales in Mainland China rose mid-single digit after returning to growth in March. Our online sales increased strong double digits worldwide, with growth accelerating significantly from February to March. The strength of our global travel retail business in January and February enabled it to deliver low single-digit sales growth for the quarter, excluding Dr. Jart+. Each of our 3 regions are at different stages of impact from the COVID-19 outbreak as I speak with you today. Furthermore, within regions, the extent of containment and recovery varies. As a result and given how fluid the situation is, we are continuously fine-tuning our strategies with our brand and regional teams to both manage the present and plan for the future.  Across the regions, a majority of our facilities have continued to manufacture and distribute products, though in a much reduced capacity. Most of our offices globally are operating in a work-from-home scenario, but that, too, is evolving. Our China headquarters in Shanghai has fully reopened as all employees began working in the office daily 3 weeks ago after having been on a staggered schedule for several weeks. As offices reopened, however, we are going back to work in a different way. We are employing additional safety measures for health and hygiene. We are also applying the experiences of work-from-home with new ways to collaborate and engage more effectively.  In our Asia/Pacific region, our business in Mainland China is further improving as retail stores began to reopen with shortened hours in March. By mid-April, virtually every door had reopened. We are encouraged by China efforts in containing the virus and the initial signs of recovery. We expect to return to double-digit sales growth in Mainland China in the fourth quarter. More recently, sales in Korea have begun to grow and stores have started to reopen. However, Japan, Australia and markets in Southeast Asia are still in the containment phase, with most retail stores closed as we speak.  In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, retail stores in most countries had been closed since early March, with the primary exception being in the Balkan Peninsula and the Nordic region. Some countries have recently announced plans to gradually reopen, most notably Germany and Italy, which are promising signs. Prior to these temporary door closures, several countries in Western Europe had been experiencing lower retail traffic as tourist abated in response to COVID-19. We expect these headwinds to persist for some time to come.  In the Americas, most retail stores have been closed since mid-March. Although retailers started seeing much lower traffic earlier in the month as social distancing began. More recently, several states in the U.S. have announced guidelines for the recovery, and we are starting to see very limited reopening with curbside pickup. We are closely monitoring the evolution of consumer behavior through this challenging time and we are developing strategies to address it. We are using sophisticated social media listening tools, machine learning and other qualitative and quantitative research techniques.  Each day, we are assessing how consumers express their needs and desire, from seeking positivity, self-care and wellness to understanding their at-home needs and routines to hearing their environmental and sustainability concerns. Our successful strategy built on multiple engines of growth is as vital as ever. Our diversified portfolio of categories, channels, geographies, brands and price points give us many levers to fuel the business and will play a crucial role during recovery when stores reopen and consumers restock at home.  Our robust global skincare portfolio, vibrant online business, a broad exposure in Asia/Pacific are the primary engines of growth in this moment. This engine had tremendous momentum before COVID-19 and are playing a crucial role during containment while brick-and-mortar is closed.  Let me first speak on skincare. Emerging trends are increasing the appeal of the category, bolstering already strong category dynamics. Taking care of one's skin has become an expression of self-care, which has risen in importance. Consumers are actively exploring subcategories and expanding their regimens, finding peace of mind in the ritual of their routine. Our focus on hero products is the right strategy as consumers seek brands and products they trust. Consumers are newly discovering continuing to return to our heros.  Beloved heroes like Est\u00e9e Lauder's Advanced Night Repair, La Mer, Cr\u00e8me de la Mer Treatment Lotion and Concentrate and Clinique's Moisture Surge has been seeing strong global demand online since the outbreak, demonstrating the dynamics of big brands. In this unprecedented time, we are staying true to our belief in the power of innovation on our hero franchises. We launched Est\u00e9e Lauder Perfectionist Pro Rapid Brightening Treatment, Clinique Even Better Clinical Radical Dark Spot Corrector + Interrupter and the new Eye Concentrate from La Mer.  Consumer demand has been especially compelling. In fact, for the Perfectionist Serum, its March launch on Alibaba haibox was one of Est\u00e9e Lauder's best ever on the platform. Clinique Even Better Serum is far exceeding expectation in Mainland China and has been highly sought online in the United States. And La Mer launch contributed to significant share gains in luxury on Tmall. Among our channels, online is thriving around the world. As we discussed with you at our Investor Day last year, we have long believed in the excellent growth prospects of online and have been investing in this dynamic channel for years. Our presence is global with online sales in over 50 countries. We are highly diversified with over 300 brand.com sites, over 60 brand boutiques on platforms such as Tmall and over 1,700 retail.com doors. Our online brand teams have been actively engaged since the containment measures took hold, optimizing product placement to address consumer current wants and needs and showing cases tools like virtual try-on to ease decision-making.  The Est\u00e9e Lauder brand expanded its online sales strategy to include a broader array of social selling activities from live shows on Instagram focused on self-care with global spokesmodels to live streaming from its brand sites with global and local mega-parties to live chats with consumer on its brand site, to personalized 1:1 outreach through various communication tools. M.A.C pivoted its long-waited April launch for its newest Selena capsule collection to online and social selling to honor the commitment it had made to consumers. The brand employed an exciting digital activation in place and in-person events for the global launch to tremendous success, as the order sold out online in 2 days. Selena is the biggest collection launched to date in terms of total sales on maccosmetics.com.  Bobbi Brown began daily lesson with the brand's pro makeup artists across digital channels, a topic most requested by consumers. Initial signs are positive, and the brand is welcoming all new consumer, thanks to this always-on artistry initiative. Jo Malone London has seen an influx of activity with its digital communities as consumers have sought to elevate and uplift their space with the power of scent. China, the brand's home fragrances in bath and body categories have doubled their mix of business.  Through our action like this, in recent weeks, we drove conversion rates sharply higher, and our sales have risen across all demographics. I'm especially encouraged by the online growth we have seen from the ageless consumers. Globally, our brands are seeing increases in new consumers of 3 to 4x. Some rates are even higher. For La Mer in the United Kingdom, new consumer acquisition is higher by 5x; while in Thailand, across all brands, it is higher by 8x. As consumer behaviors evolve during this time, we are hersening more data, leveraging our analytics capability to derive even better consumer insight to provide even better service.  When retail stores reopen, we will be in a stronger position to further unlock the potential of omnichannel. We are also focusing on the areas of most immediate opportunity in Asia/Pacific, with Mainland China as of March and Korea as of April moving from containment to recovery. We told you on our last earnings call that we stood ready to facilitate recovery as soon as the market supported it and we are doing just that.  In Mainland China, we successfully piloted emerging business model for online and department stores to adapt to the change in landscape. For La Mer, personalized service across channels with curated and targeted communication drove both online sales and department store sales significantly higher in the month of March. The strength of the La Mer repeat business model has been a key factor for its strong recovery and contributed to the brand's outstanding prestige beauty share gains in Mainland China in the quarter.  As countries in Asia/Pacific move into recovery, we are mindful of the consumer in these markets who traditionally purchase our products in travel retail but not able to do so with air travel largely curtailed. Our regional brand leads are working to meet this consumer demand in markets, be it in department stores, specialty-multi, freestanding stores or online. Our travel retail team is also actively engaged as destinations in the channel reopen, already driving positive trends in Hainan or Macau. We remain focused on meeting the needs of Chinese and Asia consumers with local relevancy and local trends. Since we last spoke in February, we have advanced our work toward our new investment in a state-of-art innovation center, which will open in Shanghai.  In closing, this unprecedented time, I'm moved by how deeply we are leading our company values and how our intent of becoming an even better company through this challenging moment. With our extraordinary people and our successful strategy built on a multiple engine of growth, we stand ready to emerge strongly when the global recovery begins. Now I will turn the call over to Tracey.\nTracey Travis: Thank you, Fabrizio, and hello, everyone. COVID-19 is certainly proving to be the most significant challenge we have faced as a public company, as much of our brick-and-mortar distribution globally has been deemed nonessential during the quarter by several jurisdictions and remains closed today. We continue to do our best to support our communities and our employees while also working to mitigate the business impact during this time.  As a reminder, my commentary today is adjusted for the items that Rainey mentioned at the beginning of the call and net sales growth numbers are in constant currency. So looking at our third quarter results. Net sales fell 10%, driven by the rapidly evolving impacts from COVID-19 that occurred throughout the quarter. As the majority of our brick-and-mortar distribution throughout the world was closed as the quarter progressed, we quickly pivoted to drive sales online. Our online growth accelerated sharply at the end of March and continued to rise in April. Sales grew in travel retail from a strong January and February before travel restrictions were enacted and skincare remained our most resilient category.  The Americas region and the makeup category suffered the biggest shortfalls. The December acquisition of Dr. Jart+ added approximately 2 points of net sales growth. Our gross margin decreased 320 basis points compared to the third quarter last year due to a combination of factors. In the first 7 months of our fiscal year, we saw outstanding growth in our skincare category, much of it in Asia and in travel retail. To meet what has now been our third year of double-digit demand for our products, we supplemented our internal manufacturing capacity with additional third-party suppliers, and we incurred increased air freight to support sales growth in areas distant from our manufacturing facilities. This resulted in higher supply chain costs in our third quarter.  The impact of increased tariffs, higher obsolescence and promotional activity also contributed as well as the inventory step-up related to Dr. Jart+. Previous initiatives like Leading Beauty Forward, which is still projected to contribute approximately $425 million to $475 million in net savings by fiscal 2021, have put us on much stronger footing to weather normal economic downturns. However, the impact of COVID-19 has not been a normal downturn. The sudden and dramatic change in sales growth from the beginning of the third quarter to the end created a deleverage effect that could not be offset quickly enough by the significant cost actions we took, which totaled approximately $250 million. Therefore, operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 250 basis points.  As we told you last quarter, we expect to see a greater impact from our third quarter cost actions, including advertising and promotion reductions more aligned to sales performance, a hiring curtailment and the benefits of work from home, which yielded sharply reduced travel and meeting expense as well as consulting expenses in our fourth quarter. As it became apparent that store closures and social distancing measures would move beyond China to be adopted around the world, we implemented even more cost actions that will have a more meaningful impact on curtailment of expenses beginning in May. These primarily include furloughs and other leaves of absence as well as temporary reduction in compensation for management and board members.  The capabilities we have built and the actions we are taking now enable us to manage through the situation today while funding targeted strategic investments going forward, which will position us well to emerge strongly when the recovery is more apparent. Our interest expense rose by $11 million to $28 million during the quarter, reflecting higher debt levels to finance the acquisition of Dr. Jart+. Our effective tax rate increased to 30.5% from 22.1% in last year's third quarter, primarily attributable to a higher effective rate on the company's foreign operations due to the mix of earnings.  Adjusted diluted EPS of $0.85 fell 45% compared to the prior year. Currency diluted EPS by $0.01 and the acquisition of Dr. Jart+ diluted EPS by approximately $0.03. During the quarter, we recorded $346 million of impairment charges related to 4 brands and certain freestanding retail stores that have been further challenged by the impact of COVID-19 on consumer demand. We believe that our strong balance sheet and ample liquidity provide core competitive advantages for our company, demonstrating the importance of scale. These position us to not only manage through a crisis but to emerge from it stronger.  During the quarter, we borrowed $1.3 billion under our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility and had $200 million of commercial paper outstanding, ending the quarter with nearly $5 billion in cash and cash equivalents. In April, we issued $700 million of 2.6% 10-year senior notes in order to further enhance our financial flexibility and liquidity and repaid the commercial paper with the remaining capacity under the revolving credit facility. We were able to do all of this while maintaining our strong single A credit rating.  For the 9 months, we generated $1.95 billion in net cash flows from operating activities, an increase of 11% from the prior year. We invested $468 million in capital expenditures and $1.04 billion to acquire the remaining interest in Dr. Jart+. We also used $883 million to repurchase shares and $502 million to pay dividends. To further enhance near-term liquidity, we are focusing our capital investment on areas necessary for future growth and paring back in areas such as retail renovations and office improvements. We cut our planned capital expenditures by 1/3 and now expect to spend between $600 million and $650 million for the full year.  Additionally, we have suspended share repurchases for the balance of this fiscal year and our quarterly dividend that would have been paid in June of 2020. All of these activities greatly enhance our ability to manage through the shutdown in brick-and-mortar for an extended period of time while we focus on stimulating greater consumption online.  History has not provided any truly comparable recent events we can use as guidance concerning the effects of the global pandemic. The disruption to our business caused by COVID-19 has clearly been more widespread and more pronounced than we had expected it would be when we last spoke with you just a few months ago in February. We delivered remarkably strong double-digit growth in sales and adjusted EPS through January, but that was followed by the dramatic spread of the pandemic and the related door closings and curtailment of travel that we spoke about.  Due to the fluidity of the situation, it is both complex and difficult to predict the duration or the timing and trajectory of the recovery and the corresponding impact on our business. At this point, in the fourth quarter, the majority of our distribution, with the exception of China and a few other markets, remains closed. And while we are encouraged by the weekly acceleration of our global online business, we do not have enough visibility into the progression of the rest of the business until more retail doors open in the coming months. And we do believe traffic could initially return at a slower pace as some consumers remain tentative until a treatment is developed.  Therefore, given the level of uncertainty, we are not providing explicit sales and EPS guidance for the year. That said, there are a few guideposts that we can provide to you. The inclusion of 6 months of sales from the acquisition of Dr. Jart+ should add about 1 percentage point to sales growth for the year. It is expected to dilute EPS by about $0.14 due to purchase accounting. Currency translation is expected to negatively affect reported sales growth by 1 percentage point, reflecting weighted average rates of $1.11 for the euro, $1.26 for the pound and $7.03 for the won for the fiscal year. The related EPS dilution should be approximately $0.05.  We are very encouraged as we see the beginnings of recovery in China and markets around the world begin to discuss gradually lifting retail and travel restrictions as the virus abates. We expect strong online acceleration to continue as underlying consumer demand is driving both replenishment and new customers online. However, unlike the third quarter where many of our global doors were opened until the last month of the quarter, we expect that most of our retail distribution will remain closed for much of the fourth quarter, and consumer traffic will likely recover slowly in brick-and-mortar. We expect greater sales and margin declines in the fourth quarter as a result. We estimate that global prestige beauty will decline double digits in the second half of our fiscal year.  We are also mindful of the risk of a global recession and a slow recovery in employment impacting consumer sentiment and discretionary spending. Our gross margin in the fourth quarter will reflect the adverse conditions we have been experiencing in March and April. The sudden and dramatic change to our volume forecast is expected to trigger an accounting rule requiring us to recognize the impact of reduced manufacturing volumes on our standard costs. Our plants have been running at meaningfully reduced capacity, reflecting some temporary plant closures as well as reduced efficiencies to accommodate social distancing requirements, staggered shift changes and other changes necessary in this environment.  We are also required to recognize expenses related to manufacturing employees who are not working. These expenses are now recognized in the current period instead of when the product is sold. The inclusion of Dr. Jart+, with the impact of the inventory step-up, will also pressure our gross margin. We expect our belt-tightening efforts to have a more pronounced impact in the fourth quarter to partially offset the negative impacts I've discussed. We are implementing some of the additional actions in May and expect to deliver fourth quarter savings of between $500 million and $600 million. Our full year effective tax rate is expected to be approximately for 24%.  So those are some of the guideposts that we can provide to you for the year. We are committed to continue to take the appropriate actions to rationalize our cost base relative to the new normal and return as quickly as possible to both sales growth and margin expansion as the COVID-19 situation stabilizes during the course of fiscal 2021. We delivered tremendous sales and profit growth through the first half of the year as our business continued to benefit from the strategic actions we took over the past several years to position our company for sustainable, profitable growth. And while the unfortunate temporary shock of COVID-19 has made our outlook for the balance of this year uncertain, we have taken appropriate action to mitigate the effects of the pandemic while continuing to protect our business to be able to be well positioned for both the near-term recovery and the long-term opportunities inherent in global prestige beauty.  On behalf of Fabrizio and the Est\u00e9e Lauder Company's leadership team, we extend our immense gratitude to all of our employees around the world for their extraordinary efforts to manage during this unprecedented period. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. I wanted first to talk about -- so many questions. So I wanted first to talk about -- I have so many questions. So I wanted first to talk about travel retail and just what your data and analytics have told you over time about the sales historically through that channel. How much of it is sort of impulse? How much of it is new consumers discovering your brands? How much of it is sales that would have or could happen elsewhere like a replenishment-type sale when someone travels? Because that could inform thinking about your ability to recapture some of that sales or what degree of that sales, even assuming global travel remains suppressed for a good amount of time.\nFabrizio Freda: Yes. I think, first of all, your assumption is correct. Our data confirms that those are consumers that while traveling are buying, discovering or replenishing their products. So then there is business travel, where people that travel for business bring back some gifts, and obviously, this creates consumption. But in travel retail, the most successful products all over the world tend to be what we call our hero products, so the products which have high loyalty, a high repurchase rate because both as a gift and as for personal consumption, which are the 2 drivers of travel retail, people really want to buy products that they are pretty sure will either replenish their habits or create exciting gifts.  In that sense, there is the possibility to recover at least part of the travel retail sales in the country of origins. And we are working on this in every country, many emerging markets, in China, in U.S., in Europe. And so there is a project to do this as much as possible. However, in this moment, to be very clear, travel retail in Europe and U.S. is basically closed. And so in the quarter 4, there is a very big issue of closures that is in the middle of the travel retail sales, which are possible in the short term.  In Asia, we are seeing already amazing results when there are openings. In this moment, the travel retail within China, particularly in the Hainan island or the travel retail in Korea, the travel retail in Hong Kong, Macau, these start already coming back and is delivering good growth. We are focusing, in this case, very much more on conversion and is working. So it again is a word to tail. But the real travel retail recovery will start happening in fiscal year '21 with the gradual reopening of travel and will be probably one of the most gradual reopening in the recovery from our expectation and from our data.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: Hope you're well. I guess, is it possible that you could talk a little bit more about what you saw in March relative to January, February and what you've been seeing in April across your key categories, geographies and channels? Because I think that, too, would help inform at least the near-term visibility. And I guess, relatedly, if you're able -- it sounds like you have line of sight to some belt-tightening initiatives in the fourth quarter, but I'm trying to juxtapose that against some of the near-term manufacturing and other COVID-related headwinds that you spoke to, Tracey. So just a little bit more color about what you've seen and are seeing in the moment while things are shut down.\nFabrizio Freda: Yes. I'll start from what we're seeing on the sales side and then let Tracey cover all the financial implications and the financial aspects. So the recovery, first of all, is very different by region because the COVID-19 issue is a different speed and a different level of depth in different markets, and some markets are already, as you know, in recovery, other markets are still in the middle of the issue. So we are managing things in a very differentiated set of way by region, by country.  So what we see in this moment is that in -- still, the closures are in Europe and U.S. are 90%, 12%. If you have seen some of the data that are emerging on the situation in United States in the last week of March or the first week of April, the market was minus 70%, and the brick-and-mortar closure has a very big impact. So this -- we see the month of March, the month of April and part of month of May where closures are very big in EMEA and in North America, has been probably the worst moment for that region. And then we see a gradual recovery as the brick-and-mortar will open in these regions, meaning Europe and America. And also in Europe and America, we see already an extraordinary progress of the online. That's the key important point.  On the other side, in places -- in April, in places like China, Korea, Taiwan, we see already double-digit growth. We already see the recovery being very active. And that, for us, is very encouraging because it shows that as soon as there is a recovery, as soon as there is a recovery from the consumer point of view, so when the consumer are back with the spirit of really going back to their normal habits like is starting, as I said, in China, Korea or Taiwan, the double-digit growth comes back fast. And because we are seeing -- we see both increased consumption, we see a restocking in consumer homes and we see a restocking in trade, which happen at the same time. So the recovery is strong, but the recovery is for the moment only in these areas, and I said, is in global online.  In global online, most of the areas of the world is double digit but there are areas which are triple digit. And then the recovery, as I said, started in very few travel retail stores which are open, as I said, mainly in China and Korea, but the rest of the world for the moment is still closed. And so in fiscal year '21, we expect to see all the engines, meaning including the European and U.S. brick-and-mortar gradually coming back. But as Tracey has clarified in her prepared remarks, we believe the comeback of brick-and-mortar will be gradual. We have signs of this already in Asia, where the recovery really starts online and starts gradually in brick-and-mortar and brick-and-mortar acceleration takes much more time because it takes not only the technical reopening but takes the consumer confidence to buy and brick-and-mortar comes back. And this will only come back more gradually. So that's what we see. In summary, we see faster recovery in Asia for the moment, a lot of closures still in Europe and U.S., very fast recovery online globally and a more gradual recovery in travel retail.\nTracey Travis: And Steve, to your question on the cost savings and the manufacturing variance. The way I would think about that in the fourth quarter, the $500 million to $600 million of cost savings, about 1/3 of it is related to employee actions and the other 2/3 related to other expense areas that we've stepped up in terms of our cost savings, advertising, consulting, travel, et cetera. So that's generally the split in the fourth quarter.  As it relates to our gross profit margin and you saw the impact in the third quarter, we expect that we will continue to see, in the fourth quarter, the impact obviously of the tariffs and of the higher third-party sourcing costs that will impact us in the fourth quarter. In addition to that, I spoke about the under-absorption of some of our overhead and labor costs that we need to expense in the fourth quarter. So the bigger impact will be in the fourth quarter on that. So our gross profit margins will decline further in the fourth quarter related to those onetime issues related to the lower production volumes. As we increase production volumes as we emerge out of COVID-19, that will correct itself.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Olivia Tong from Bank of America.\nOlivia Tong: I wanted to ask you about just your sales. And I think it's fairly impressive that China was only down for the month of February and that travel retail was still up in the quarter. But the U.S. decline was pretty staggering. So as we start thinking about when Western markets start to reopen, can you talk about the differences not only in underlying demand in these key markets, but obviously, your infrastructure? Because clearly, e-commerce penetration is significantly higher in Asia than in the U.S. So can you talk about just your infrastructure? Is e-commerce better developed just in China overall? And how do you compare for that? And then just thinking later in the year, I know it's still pretty far away, but how -- what's guiding how you plan for holidays, Singles Day and things down the road as we think about the future?\nFabrizio Freda: So I'll start, and then Tracey will add perspective. Is -- so the penetration online actually is very strong in the United States, in the U.K. and in China. Those are the 3 markets where we have the stronger penetration online, where the market is very well-developed online. So in terms of how we see the situation in the U.S., obviously, our stabilization plan in the U.S. have been postponed by the COVID issue that emerged, so we'll take a bit more time than what we originally were hoping in -- when we had an encouraging last quarter in calendar year '19.  So -- but it is because of the closures of the brick-and-mortar. In the United States, the online acceleration is outstanding as we speak. And so actually, it's very reassuring to us that the percentage of our business online will dramatically increase. Now this was already planned for the long term, but this issue has accelerated it. And as I explained in my prepared remarks, what we are seeing in the U.K., in the U.S. and in China, that the -- particularly the ageless consumer, so the consumer is about 50, 55, that, as you know, the online was the -- mainly for millennials and the new generations. But frankly, all these other consumers now are extra consumers that are using e-commerce much more in all its aspects. And we believe that this change is here to stay. And so the increase or the percentage of business online, including retail.com, so it's not only brand.com, it's retail.com, it's platforms in China and in other parts of the world, is pure plays in the U.K.  So in all the online channels, there is an increase of percentage of sales that goes online. To be clear, for the long term, this is positive to us. It's very positive. Online has always been one of our key drivers, one of our profitable drivers, and most importantly, make a stronger platform for the future of omnichannel, which is the way also particularly in luxury. The distribution models will evolve on all fronts. So good development and we believe this is positive. Tracey, do you want to add perspective?\nTracey Travis: Then on our infrastructure as well as our plans for holiday, clearly, we are mindful of and watching very closely in terms of as doors open, the productivity of those doors. So certainly, both with our retail partners as well as our own freestanding stores, just making sure as doors open, that they are productive, that they are profitable. And we will, as we have over the last few years, take appropriate actions if we find that we do emerge out of this with brick-and-mortar doors that are less profitable than we would like for them to be.  As it relates to holiday, at the same time, one of the things that Fabrizio, when he was speaking about online, the inference there is we are very much focused on the fact that demand remains strong. And it's really the access to our products that has become challenging in markets like in Europe as well as in the Americas. So lots of activity or programs shifting to online really to make sure that people can access our products. We also are focused on, for holiday, what we think holiday will be like. We actually are hoping that by holiday, things stabilize a bit. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are mindful that there could be a recession, certainly impact, but hoping that by holiday, people are ready to shop again. So our holiday programs remain intact. The quantities may be adjusted a bit, given how much demand has come back by that time.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Erinn Murphy from Piper Sandler.\nErinn Murphy: And I hope you both are well as well. I guess a follow-up just to the Americas, Tracey, for you. When you think about sales down 23%, it was worse than we thought. Could you just quantify how much was truly the decline from store closures in the last 2 to 3 weeks of the quarter versus maybe pulling back on wholesale sell-in? And then bigger picture, as you think about the mix of business in the Americas, I guess, Fabrizio, you already addressed online clearly accelerating. But I'm more curious on kind of how you think about the reliance or the toggles between the department store, the specialty multi-channel as well as the freestanding stores on the other side of this crisis.\nTracey Travis: Sure. So I mean in January, as Fabrizio mentioned, we actually saw positive growth in all of our markets, including in the Americas. We actually started to see some softness towards the end of February. And to your point, the doors were not closed but certainly, it was apparent by that time that COVID-19 was starting to spread, and consumers were starting to get a bit nervous about shopping in-store and really focusing on stocking up on more essentials. And then March, we saw the biggest impact obviously with the doors closed, half of March, but really the early part of March, a tremendous decline in shopping because of the tentativeness of the consumer and really the consumer focused understandably so on health and essentials for their homes and their families.\nFabrizio Freda: Yes. And the other thing I want to add is, obviously, our job is also to protect our profitability. And when we saw this evolving, we started spending less already in February. And then in March, also our spending was reduced in order to mitigate the impact of the thing. So to be clear, we are anticipating the events. And so the spending was reduced, already starting gradually in February. The consumer sentiment started going down already in February. And then in March, when the closures started in United States, sales went to 0 because basically brick-and-mortar completely closed and the consumer was shocked, the retailers stopped ordering. So you need to see the month of March like a very big, deep moment. And that's why the overall number was -- or the quarter was negative.  But to be clear, until January included and already was true in the last quarter of calendar '19, we were stabilizing the business and this was going on the positive trends. And again, we plan, when the market will be back, to go back to our stabilization program. In terms of what will happen, to your question on what will happen to the other part of the business, which is not online, obviously, if the percentage of online business will increase, the rest will be reduced. And so in our opinion, there will be closures, there will be a reduction of brick-and-mortar stores overall. And this will make the brick-and-mortar stores more productive and the ability to deliver experience better. So we don't see this negative -- necessarily as negatively short in the long term. It will be obviously a negative in the short term.  And we see the future of freestanding store and brand.com being an omnichannel future. In this period, it's fascinating to see how consumers are learning different way to use the online, the concept of last mile, the role of the small convenience stores, meaning freestanding store versus brand.com, how the 2 combined can create new experiences. So there's going to be some interesting, and frankly, in our opinion, promising evolution of the ability to serve the consumer in a luxury environment in the future. But the transition is going to be complex, difficult. And in the transition, the biggest opportunity is the strong growth of online. And again for us, this is also a positive because we have a great infrastructure. We are very strong in brand.com, in retail.com, in platform, in pure plays, depending on which part of the world, there are -- this channel had a different percentage of the online business, but we are well covered in each one of them. And so driving this across the globe and in the United States is going to be in the transition out of COVID, the strongest opportunity.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Michael Binetti from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nMichael Binetti: I guess, Fabrizio, just to follow that question in the Americas. I guess you said January is positive and February a bit slower, so March deeply negative. I guess, still to average out to negative 23%, it seems like you held some inventories that were probably ordered by the retailers in the U.S. when you saw this coming. Maybe you could comment on, as we look to reopening, what were going -- what kind of inventory levels out in the channel you see that we're going to be working with as we reopen in the U.S., I guess? And then, I guess, just go back to travel for a minute to get to the positive number. We're just looking at some of the passenger data in China.  Looks like it was down maybe 70% or 80% through February. So to get your number to be positive in travel, I think you've commented to us that Chinese consumer is about half of that business before. It speaks to very big growth rates in Europe and in the U.S. for your entire business to land a positive in the quarter. I'm just wondering, I know you said it to be into fiscal '21 until we really see a bona fide recovery in travel. But it seems like you've done some things in that channel that are driving a pretty meaningful share gain in the travel locations that were open heading into this. I wonder if you could comment on any of the strategy there that you think stands out recently.\nFabrizio Freda: Yes. I'll start answer your travel question and then Tracey will go on the inventory and -- question. So -- but basically, you're right. I think what you were describing is what happened, but let me summarize it, is January was another extraordinary month for travel. So that's also what is in the mix. So in January, remember, January is Chinese New Year. So -- and Chinese New Year, yes, started to be impacted but still some of it happened. And so we gained market share. We were planning to do that. We had an amazing program in all the areas that were open and not only, but -- so travel was strong in the October, December period and continued to be very strong in general.  Then in February, there was a slowdown obviously but travel remained open in other part of the world. And then in March, travel really was closing. So yes, in travel in the month of March was the worst month. So the mix of the 3 months explained our strong market share performance in the quarter. I believe our market share performance in travel will continue, but the market in quarter 4 will be probably the worst in travel retail because Europe and U.S. have really closed. And in Asia, as I said, there is many Asia stores which are closed. There are 3 really active areas, which is within China, the domestic travel with Hainan to reach the center, which has been reactivated at a certain percentage, not fully, but with much higher conversion from travelers to purchases.  So the key point here, remember that about 10% of travel buy something. The moment travel get reduced but is open and 30%, 40% of travel buy something for several reasons, because of good marketing, because there is less people, because it's easier, because less crowded, because there are good activities, this changes. And so in this moment, we are really seeing active few doors but very important ones with very high conversion rates. And that's what is -- but then one -- the other thing which is encouraging in our travel retail reading in this moment is that in the moment, most of the world is closed, but when we see openings, the consumer is back very fast because the traffic will only be back gradually but the conversion rates can be much better.  And last thing I want to say, the other thing, which is the positive expectation for the long term in travel retail also in this class is also in travel retail, the percentage of business in retail, meaning the ability to prebook online when travel, is increasing. And as you can imagine, we have great capabilities in that. We have a good structure. We have invested in that. So we are ready. And you can imagine that in this area, particularly in the period of transition where sales retail will still be important also while traveling, you can expect a continuous increase of the online part also in travel retail. So very tough quarter for travel retail, but still, I believe that the long term of travel retail will remain extraordinarily strong and extraordinarily promising.\nTracey Travis: And as far as the inventory in the trade, in our -- with our wholesale customers, clearly with stores closed 6 to 7 weeks, I would say the early part of the door closures we saw -- we started to see a slow pickup in online. And as we indicated, it has really progressed. So certainly, our retailers, those that can share inventory between their brick-and-mortar and their online sites have been drawn down on some of the store -- inventory planned for stores on their retailer.com sites. And we've seen those progress quite nicely and sales really picking up strongly in the last 2 to 3 weeks in particular.  So as doors open, we expect that from a shipment standpoint, we'll see a slow reorder from a replenishment standpoint, certainly from some of the move -- the fast movers that have moved most quickly on retailer.com sites. But as the quarter progresses, we would expect shipments to gradually strengthen throughout the quarter, and by June, really be much stronger.\nOperator: And we have time for one more question. Our final question comes from the line of Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group.\nDana Telsey: Glad to hear everyone's healthy and safe. With the expense reductions that you've put in place, how much of it do you think could be permanent versus transitory? And lastly, with the innovation plans underway, any shifts in timing and launches, given the current situation?\nTracey Travis: So as you know, Dana, as we've announced, we have taken some short-term cost actions to improve the liquidity situation, and we announced those in the middle of April and so those are some of the employee actions that we've taken. And then some of the other actions are also short term as it relates to advertising, really rightsizing more our advertising to the current sales trends, which will obviously pick up as our sales trends pick up.  There are other areas like travel. I think we're all getting used to the ability to work from home and communicate online. And so there are other areas that are more discretionary that we certainly are looking at more permanently, having cost reductions in some of those other cost areas. So -- but it's something that, as you know, we have ongoing cost management programs in addition to the program for Leading Beauty Forward, we have other cost actions, and we take advantage of the opportunities that we see to lock in savings whenever we can.\nFabrizio Freda: Yes. And I just want to add to this for the long term also, what were the most -- the best drivers for our growth before the crisis are the one which are coming better stronger. That seems to be the one that will come out stronger out of the crisis. If you think that online channels globally is coming out stronger, the Chinese consumers is recovering first and stronger. Skincare is recovering first and stronger than any other part. And within makeup, face makeup, within fragrance or seasonal fragrances and within travel retail, the very efficient travel retail doors of Asia are recovering faster.  So our key drivers of growth are recovering first and stronger for the long term. So said in other words, I see all the signs that the key drivers of growth will come out of this crisis stronger for the long term. And even if in the short term, we are going to be hit hard by the closures, particularly by the very understandable consumer shock in this moment in the medium, long term, we will be a stronger organization with our key long-term drivers further validated.  And one of these drivers will remain innovation, to answer your last question, is on innovation. We are continuing to innovate. As I said in my prepared remarks, we are reinforcing and investing in a Shanghai center to make sure that our innovation become even more relevant to Asia and to the Asian consumers and to the Chinese consumers, particularly. And we have a focus in our innovations much more than before in this period -- in this period of transition. We are focusing our ratio on fewer and bigger innovation. We are focusing our innovation on what works better online in this transition or trying to pivot online where possible because of the closures. And we have focused our innovation on hero franchises, meaning on the franchises, which are -- that have high consumer loyalty and high consumer awareness because in this moment of transition, in the middle of the crisis and out of the COVID crisis, we clearly see the consumers are interested in the brands they trust, in the product they know. They go back first to loyalty even before very new adventures. And so we are reflecting this in our innovation plan that in this moment, I believe, is one of the strongest we have had.\nOperator: Thank you. And that concludes today's question-and-answer session.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Fabrizio Freda",
            "content": "Thank you, Rainey, and hello, everyone. I hope you are in good health during this difficult time as the world confronts COVID-19. My heart goes out to those afflicted, and my deep gratitude goes to everyone around the world who is part of the global relief efforts.  Before I discuss results and our strategies to navigate through this challenging environment, I want to first thank our employees at the Este\u0301e Lauder Companies. The care and compassion you have shown one another since the outbreak while also balancing new work routines for yourselves and caring for your families has been truly inspiring. Your creativity, a sense of collaboration, have risen to new heights as we have adapted our business from marketing to sales to manufacturing and more. Our employees have truly exemplified our belief in leadership from average share. The Este\u0301e Lauder Companies and some of its charitable foundations have made donations to help limit the spread of the virus and ease the related hardships faced by those it affected. To date, we have made donations and commitments to Doctors Without Borders, the New York City COVID-19 Response and Impact Fund, Red Cross Society of China, Shanghai Charity Foundation, Give2Asia and Community Chest of Korea.  This week, we established the ELC Care Employee Relief Fund, our newest giving initiative, which will be funded through our contributions from the company, the Lauder family and our employees. It will provide immediate and critical financial release to employees whose lives have been impacted by the pandemic.  Our brands have also found meaningful ways to contribute. The Este\u0301e Lauder brand donated 2 million surgical masks for frontline workers in New York, while Clinique donated 50,000 skin care products to doctor and nurses in New York City's hospitals. Aveda launched Aveda Cares, a relief program to benefit independent salons and stylists in the United States. The multifacet initiative will help salons prepare to recover from COVID-19-related closures. The M.A.C VIVA GLAM Fund is continuing its decades-long giving by allocating $10 million to 250 local organization all over the world that are providing essential needs and services to people at higher risk during the COVID-19 pandemic.  I'm also especially proud of how the company mobilized to manufacture hand sanitizer for frontline workers, high-risk individuals and our employees, thanks to the tremendous work of our global research development and supply chains teams. Our facility in the United States, the United Kingdom and Belgium are making over 1 million hand sanitizers.  Now turning to the quarter's performance. As we discussed with you on our last earnings call in early February, we expected third quarter sales to decline. After a strong January globally, we anticipated pressure in February and March in our Asia/Pacific region and our travel retail channel, given the extent of the COVID-19 outbreak at that point in time. However, COVID-19 continued to spread around the world as the quarter progressed, and social distancing measures began to impact retail traffic. As March evolved, travel was significantly curtailed and virtually all stores in the Americas and Europe, the Middle East and Africa temporarily closed, hindering consumer's primary access to supply such that the magnitude of the impact on our business was far greater than initially anticipated.  In this very complex challenging environment, reported sales fell 9% in constant currency. Tracy will provide more details about our financial performance in a moment. In this volatile quarter, there were several bright spots in our business, which led to global prestige beauty share expansion. The Este\u0301e Lauder brand grew high single digits while DECIEM and Le Labo also delivered sales growth. Skincare sales grew internationally, including Dr. Jart+.  In our Asia/Pacific region, sales in Mainland China rose mid-single digit after returning to growth in March. Our online sales increased strong double digits worldwide, with growth accelerating significantly from February to March. The strength of our global travel retail business in January and February enabled it to deliver low single-digit sales growth for the quarter, excluding Dr. Jart+. Each of our 3 regions are at different stages of impact from the COVID-19 outbreak as I speak with you today. Furthermore, within regions, the extent of containment and recovery varies. As a result and given how fluid the situation is, we are continuously fine-tuning our strategies with our brand and regional teams to both manage the present and plan for the future.  Across the regions, a majority of our facilities have continued to manufacture and distribute products, though in a much reduced capacity. Most of our offices globally are operating in a work-from-home scenario, but that, too, is evolving. Our China headquarters in Shanghai has fully reopened as all employees began working in the office daily 3 weeks ago after having been on a staggered schedule for several weeks. As offices reopened, however, we are going back to work in a different way. We are employing additional safety measures for health and hygiene. We are also applying the experiences of work-from-home with new ways to collaborate and engage more effectively.  In our Asia/Pacific region, our business in Mainland China is further improving as retail stores began to reopen with shortened hours in March. By mid-April, virtually every door had reopened. We are encouraged by China efforts in containing the virus and the initial signs of recovery. We expect to return to double-digit sales growth in Mainland China in the fourth quarter. More recently, sales in Korea have begun to grow and stores have started to reopen. However, Japan, Australia and markets in Southeast Asia are still in the containment phase, with most retail stores closed as we speak.  In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, retail stores in most countries had been closed since early March, with the primary exception being in the Balkan Peninsula and the Nordic region. Some countries have recently announced plans to gradually reopen, most notably Germany and Italy, which are promising signs. Prior to these temporary door closures, several countries in Western Europe had been experiencing lower retail traffic as tourist abated in response to COVID-19. We expect these headwinds to persist for some time to come.  In the Americas, most retail stores have been closed since mid-March. Although retailers started seeing much lower traffic earlier in the month as social distancing began. More recently, several states in the U.S. have announced guidelines for the recovery, and we are starting to see very limited reopening with curbside pickup. We are closely monitoring the evolution of consumer behavior through this challenging time and we are developing strategies to address it. We are using sophisticated social media listening tools, machine learning and other qualitative and quantitative research techniques.  Each day, we are assessing how consumers express their needs and desire, from seeking positivity, self-care and wellness to understanding their at-home needs and routines to hearing their environmental and sustainability concerns. Our successful strategy built on multiple engines of growth is as vital as ever. Our diversified portfolio of categories, channels, geographies, brands and price points give us many levers to fuel the business and will play a crucial role during recovery when stores reopen and consumers restock at home.  Our robust global skincare portfolio, vibrant online business, a broad exposure in Asia/Pacific are the primary engines of growth in this moment. This engine had tremendous momentum before COVID-19 and are playing a crucial role during containment while brick-and-mortar is closed.  Let me first speak on skincare. Emerging trends are increasing the appeal of the category, bolstering already strong category dynamics. Taking care of one's skin has become an expression of self-care, which has risen in importance. Consumers are actively exploring subcategories and expanding their regimens, finding peace of mind in the ritual of their routine. Our focus on hero products is the right strategy as consumers seek brands and products they trust. Consumers are newly discovering continuing to return to our heros.  Beloved heroes like Este\u0301e Lauder's Advanced Night Repair, La Mer, Cre\u0300me de la Mer Treatment Lotion and Concentrate and Clinique's Moisture Surge has been seeing strong global demand online since the outbreak, demonstrating the dynamics of big brands. In this unprecedented time, we are staying true to our belief in the power of innovation on our hero franchises. We launched Este\u0301e Lauder Perfectionist Pro Rapid Brightening Treatment, Clinique Even Better Clinical Radical Dark Spot Corrector + Interrupter and the new Eye Concentrate from La Mer.  Consumer demand has been especially compelling. In fact, for the Perfectionist Serum, its March launch on Alibaba haibox was one of Este\u0301e Lauder's best ever on the platform. Clinique Even Better Serum is far exceeding expectation in Mainland China and has been highly sought online in the United States. And La Mer launch contributed to significant share gains in luxury on Tmall. Among our channels, online is thriving around the world. As we discussed with you at our Investor Day last year, we have long believed in the excellent growth prospects of online and have been investing in this dynamic channel for years. Our presence is global with online sales in over 50 countries. We are highly diversified with over 300 brand.com sites, over 60 brand boutiques on platforms such as Tmall and over 1,700 retail.com doors. Our online brand teams have been actively engaged since the containment measures took hold, optimizing product placement to address consumer current wants and needs and showing cases tools like virtual try-on to ease decision-making.  The Este\u0301e Lauder brand expanded its online sales strategy to include a broader array of social selling activities from live shows on Instagram focused on self-care with global spokesmodels to live streaming from its brand sites with global and local mega-parties to live chats with consumer on its brand site, to personalized 1:1 outreach through various communication tools. M.A.C pivoted its long-waited April launch for its newest Selena capsule collection to online and social selling to honor the commitment it had made to consumers. The brand employed an exciting digital activation in place and in-person events for the global launch to tremendous success, as the order sold out online in 2 days. Selena is the biggest collection launched to date in terms of total sales on maccosmetics.com.  Bobbi Brown began daily lesson with the brand's pro makeup artists across digital channels, a topic most requested by consumers. Initial signs are positive, and the brand is welcoming all new consumer, thanks to this always-on artistry initiative. Jo Malone London has seen an influx of activity with its digital communities as consumers have sought to elevate and uplift their space with the power of scent. China, the brand's home fragrances in bath and body categories have doubled their mix of business.  Through our action like this, in recent weeks, we drove conversion rates sharply higher, and our sales have risen across all demographics. I'm especially encouraged by the online growth we have seen from the ageless consumers. Globally, our brands are seeing increases in new consumers of 3 to 4x. Some rates are even higher. For La Mer in the United Kingdom, new consumer acquisition is higher by 5x; while in Thailand, across all brands, it is higher by 8x. As consumer behaviors evolve during this time, we are hersening more data, leveraging our analytics capability to derive even better consumer insight to provide even better service.  When retail stores reopen, we will be in a stronger position to further unlock the potential of omnichannel. We are also focusing on the areas of most immediate opportunity in Asia/Pacific, with Mainland China as of March and Korea as of April moving from containment to recovery. We told you on our last earnings call that we stood ready to facilitate recovery as soon as the market supported it and we are doing just that.  In Mainland China, we successfully piloted emerging business model for online and department stores to adapt to the change in landscape. For La Mer, personalized service across channels with curated and targeted communication drove both online sales and department store sales significantly higher in the month of March. The strength of the La Mer repeat business model has been a key factor for its strong recovery and contributed to the brand's outstanding prestige beauty share gains in Mainland China in the quarter.  As countries in Asia/Pacific move into recovery, we are mindful of the consumer in these markets who traditionally purchase our products in travel retail but not able to do so with air travel largely curtailed. Our regional brand leads are working to meet this consumer demand in markets, be it in department stores, specialty-multi, freestanding stores or online. Our travel retail team is also actively engaged as destinations in the channel reopen, already driving positive trends in Hainan or Macau. We remain focused on meeting the needs of Chinese and Asia consumers with local relevancy and local trends. Since we last spoke in February, we have advanced our work toward our new investment in a state-of-art innovation center, which will open in Shanghai.  In closing, this unprecedented time, I'm moved by how deeply we are leading our company values and how our intent of becoming an even better company through this challenging moment. With our extraordinary people and our successful strategy built on a multiple engine of growth, we stand ready to emerge strongly when the global recovery begins. Now I will turn the call over to Tracey. Yes. I think, first of all, your assumption is correct. Our data confirms that those are consumers that while traveling are buying, discovering or replenishing their products. So then there is business travel, where people that travel for business bring back some gifts, and obviously, this creates consumption. But in travel retail, the most successful products all over the world tend to be what we call our hero products, so the products which have high loyalty, a high repurchase rate because both as a gift and as for personal consumption, which are the 2 drivers of travel retail, people really want to buy products that they are pretty sure will either replenish their habits or create exciting gifts.  In that sense, there is the possibility to recover at least part of the travel retail sales in the country of origins. And we are working on this in every country, many emerging markets, in China, in U.S., in Europe. And so there is a project to do this as much as possible. However, in this moment, to be very clear, travel retail in Europe and U.S. is basically closed. And so in the quarter 4, there is a very big issue of closures that is in the middle of the travel retail sales, which are possible in the short term.  In Asia, we are seeing already amazing results when there are openings. In this moment, the travel retail within China, particularly in the Hainan island or the travel retail in Korea, the travel retail in Hong Kong, Macau, these start already coming back and is delivering good growth. We are focusing, in this case, very much more on conversion and is working. So it again is a word to tail. But the real travel retail recovery will start happening in fiscal year '21 with the gradual reopening of travel and will be probably one of the most gradual reopening in the recovery from our expectation and from our data. Yes. I'll start from what we're seeing on the sales side and then let Tracey cover all the financial implications and the financial aspects. So the recovery, first of all, is very different by region because the COVID-19 issue is a different speed and a different level of depth in different markets, and some markets are already, as you know, in recovery, other markets are still in the middle of the issue. So we are managing things in a very differentiated set of way by region, by country.  So what we see in this moment is that in -- still, the closures are in Europe and U.S. are 90%, 12%. If you have seen some of the data that are emerging on the situation in United States in the last week of March or the first week of April, the market was minus 70%, and the brick-and-mortar closure has a very big impact. So this -- we see the month of March, the month of April and part of month of May where closures are very big in EMEA and in North America, has been probably the worst moment for that region. And then we see a gradual recovery as the brick-and-mortar will open in these regions, meaning Europe and America. And also in Europe and America, we see already an extraordinary progress of the online. That's the key important point.  On the other side, in places -- in April, in places like China, Korea, Taiwan, we see already double-digit growth. We already see the recovery being very active. And that, for us, is very encouraging because it shows that as soon as there is a recovery, as soon as there is a recovery from the consumer point of view, so when the consumer are back with the spirit of really going back to their normal habits like is starting, as I said, in China, Korea or Taiwan, the double-digit growth comes back fast. And because we are seeing -- we see both increased consumption, we see a restocking in consumer homes and we see a restocking in trade, which happen at the same time. So the recovery is strong, but the recovery is for the moment only in these areas, and I said, is in global online.  In global online, most of the areas of the world is double digit but there are areas which are triple digit. And then the recovery, as I said, started in very few travel retail stores which are open, as I said, mainly in China and Korea, but the rest of the world for the moment is still closed. And so in fiscal year '21, we expect to see all the engines, meaning including the European and U.S. brick-and-mortar gradually coming back. But as Tracey has clarified in her prepared remarks, we believe the comeback of brick-and-mortar will be gradual. We have signs of this already in Asia, where the recovery really starts online and starts gradually in brick-and-mortar and brick-and-mortar acceleration takes much more time because it takes not only the technical reopening but takes the consumer confidence to buy and brick-and-mortar comes back. And this will only come back more gradually. So that's what we see. In summary, we see faster recovery in Asia for the moment, a lot of closures still in Europe and U.S., very fast recovery online globally and a more gradual recovery in travel retail. So I'll start, and then Tracey will add perspective. Is -- so the penetration online actually is very strong in the United States, in the U.K. and in China. Those are the 3 markets where we have the stronger penetration online, where the market is very well-developed online. So in terms of how we see the situation in the U.S., obviously, our stabilization plan in the U.S. have been postponed by the COVID issue that emerged, so we'll take a bit more time than what we originally were hoping in -- when we had an encouraging last quarter in calendar year '19.  So -- but it is because of the closures of the brick-and-mortar. In the United States, the online acceleration is outstanding as we speak. And so actually, it's very reassuring to us that the percentage of our business online will dramatically increase. Now this was already planned for the long term, but this issue has accelerated it. And as I explained in my prepared remarks, what we are seeing in the U.K., in the U.S. and in China, that the -- particularly the ageless consumer, so the consumer is about 50, 55, that, as you know, the online was the -- mainly for millennials and the new generations. But frankly, all these other consumers now are extra consumers that are using e-commerce much more in all its aspects. And we believe that this change is here to stay. And so the increase or the percentage of business online, including retail.com, so it's not only brand.com, it's retail.com, it's platforms in China and in other parts of the world, is pure plays in the U.K.  So in all the online channels, there is an increase of percentage of sales that goes online. To be clear, for the long term, this is positive to us. It's very positive. Online has always been one of our key drivers, one of our profitable drivers, and most importantly, make a stronger platform for the future of omnichannel, which is the way also particularly in luxury. The distribution models will evolve on all fronts. So good development and we believe this is positive. Tracey, do you want to add perspective? Yes. And the other thing I want to add is, obviously, our job is also to protect our profitability. And when we saw this evolving, we started spending less already in February. And then in March, also our spending was reduced in order to mitigate the impact of the thing. So to be clear, we are anticipating the events. And so the spending was reduced, already starting gradually in February. The consumer sentiment started going down already in February. And then in March, when the closures started in United States, sales went to 0 because basically brick-and-mortar completely closed and the consumer was shocked, the retailers stopped ordering. So you need to see the month of March like a very big, deep moment. And that's why the overall number was -- or the quarter was negative.  But to be clear, until January included and already was true in the last quarter of calendar '19, we were stabilizing the business and this was going on the positive trends. And again, we plan, when the market will be back, to go back to our stabilization program. In terms of what will happen, to your question on what will happen to the other part of the business, which is not online, obviously, if the percentage of online business will increase, the rest will be reduced. And so in our opinion, there will be closures, there will be a reduction of brick-and-mortar stores overall. And this will make the brick-and-mortar stores more productive and the ability to deliver experience better. So we don't see this negative -- necessarily as negatively short in the long term. It will be obviously a negative in the short term.  And we see the future of freestanding store and brand.com being an omnichannel future. In this period, it's fascinating to see how consumers are learning different way to use the online, the concept of last mile, the role of the small convenience stores, meaning freestanding store versus brand.com, how the 2 combined can create new experiences. So there's going to be some interesting, and frankly, in our opinion, promising evolution of the ability to serve the consumer in a luxury environment in the future. But the transition is going to be complex, difficult. And in the transition, the biggest opportunity is the strong growth of online. And again for us, this is also a positive because we have a great infrastructure. We are very strong in brand.com, in retail.com, in platform, in pure plays, depending on which part of the world, there are -- this channel had a different percentage of the online business, but we are well covered in each one of them. And so driving this across the globe and in the United States is going to be in the transition out of COVID, the strongest opportunity. Yes. I'll start answer your travel question and then Tracey will go on the inventory and -- question. So -- but basically, you're right. I think what you were describing is what happened, but let me summarize it, is January was another extraordinary month for travel. So that's also what is in the mix. So in January, remember, January is Chinese New Year. So -- and Chinese New Year, yes, started to be impacted but still some of it happened. And so we gained market share. We were planning to do that. We had an amazing program in all the areas that were open and not only, but -- so travel was strong in the October, December period and continued to be very strong in general.  Then in February, there was a slowdown obviously but travel remained open in other part of the world. And then in March, travel really was closing. So yes, in travel in the month of March was the worst month. So the mix of the 3 months explained our strong market share performance in the quarter. I believe our market share performance in travel will continue, but the market in quarter 4 will be probably the worst in travel retail because Europe and U.S. have really closed. And in Asia, as I said, there is many Asia stores which are closed. There are 3 really active areas, which is within China, the domestic travel with Hainan to reach the center, which has been reactivated at a certain percentage, not fully, but with much higher conversion from travelers to purchases.  So the key point here, remember that about 10% of travel buy something. The moment travel get reduced but is open and 30%, 40% of travel buy something for several reasons, because of good marketing, because there is less people, because it's easier, because less crowded, because there are good activities, this changes. And so in this moment, we are really seeing active few doors but very important ones with very high conversion rates. And that's what is -- but then one -- the other thing which is encouraging in our travel retail reading in this moment is that in the moment, most of the world is closed, but when we see openings, the consumer is back very fast because the traffic will only be back gradually but the conversion rates can be much better.  And last thing I want to say, the other thing, which is the positive expectation for the long term in travel retail also in this class is also in travel retail, the percentage of business in retail, meaning the ability to prebook online when travel, is increasing. And as you can imagine, we have great capabilities in that. We have a good structure. We have invested in that. So we are ready. And you can imagine that in this area, particularly in the period of transition where sales retail will still be important also while traveling, you can expect a continuous increase of the online part also in travel retail. So very tough quarter for travel retail, but still, I believe that the long term of travel retail will remain extraordinarily strong and extraordinarily promising. Yes. And I just want to add to this for the long term also, what were the most -- the best drivers for our growth before the crisis are the one which are coming better stronger. That seems to be the one that will come out stronger out of the crisis. If you think that online channels globally is coming out stronger, the Chinese consumers is recovering first and stronger. Skincare is recovering first and stronger than any other part. And within makeup, face makeup, within fragrance or seasonal fragrances and within travel retail, the very efficient travel retail doors of Asia are recovering faster.  So our key drivers of growth are recovering first and stronger for the long term. So said in other words, I see all the signs that the key drivers of growth will come out of this crisis stronger for the long term. And even if in the short term, we are going to be hit hard by the closures, particularly by the very understandable consumer shock in this moment in the medium, long term, we will be a stronger organization with our key long-term drivers further validated.  And one of these drivers will remain innovation, to answer your last question, is on innovation. We are continuing to innovate. As I said in my prepared remarks, we are reinforcing and investing in a Shanghai center to make sure that our innovation become even more relevant to Asia and to the Asian consumers and to the Chinese consumers, particularly. And we have a focus in our innovations much more than before in this period -- in this period of transition. We are focusing our ratio on fewer and bigger innovation. We are focusing our innovation on what works better online in this transition or trying to pivot online where possible because of the closures. And we have focused our innovation on hero franchises, meaning on the franchises, which are -- that have high consumer loyalty and high consumer awareness because in this moment of transition, in the middle of the crisis and out of the COVID crisis, we clearly see the consumers are interested in the brands they trust, in the product they know. They go back first to loyalty even before very new adventures. And so we are reflecting this in our innovation plan that in this moment, I believe, is one of the strongest we have had."

            "name": "Tracey Travis",
            "content": "Thank you, Fabrizio, and hello, everyone. COVID-19 is certainly proving to be the most significant challenge we have faced as a public company, as much of our brick-and-mortar distribution globally has been deemed nonessential during the quarter by several jurisdictions and remains closed today. We continue to do our best to support our communities and our employees while also working to mitigate the business impact during this time.  As a reminder, my commentary today is adjusted for the items that Rainey mentioned at the beginning of the call and net sales growth numbers are in constant currency. So looking at our third quarter results. Net sales fell 10%, driven by the rapidly evolving impacts from COVID-19 that occurred throughout the quarter. As the majority of our brick-and-mortar distribution throughout the world was closed as the quarter progressed, we quickly pivoted to drive sales online. Our online growth accelerated sharply at the end of March and continued to rise in April. Sales grew in travel retail from a strong January and February before travel restrictions were enacted and skincare remained our most resilient category.  The Americas region and the makeup category suffered the biggest shortfalls. The December acquisition of Dr. Jart+ added approximately 2 points of net sales growth. Our gross margin decreased 320 basis points compared to the third quarter last year due to a combination of factors. In the first 7 months of our fiscal year, we saw outstanding growth in our skincare category, much of it in Asia and in travel retail. To meet what has now been our third year of double-digit demand for our products, we supplemented our internal manufacturing capacity with additional third-party suppliers, and we incurred increased air freight to support sales growth in areas distant from our manufacturing facilities. This resulted in higher supply chain costs in our third quarter.  The impact of increased tariffs, higher obsolescence and promotional activity also contributed as well as the inventory step-up related to Dr. Jart+. Previous initiatives like Leading Beauty Forward, which is still projected to contribute approximately $425 million to $475 million in net savings by fiscal 2021, have put us on much stronger footing to weather normal economic downturns. However, the impact of COVID-19 has not been a normal downturn. The sudden and dramatic change in sales growth from the beginning of the third quarter to the end created a deleverage effect that could not be offset quickly enough by the significant cost actions we took, which totaled approximately $250 million. Therefore, operating expenses as a percentage of sales rose 250 basis points.  As we told you last quarter, we expect to see a greater impact from our third quarter cost actions, including advertising and promotion reductions more aligned to sales performance, a hiring curtailment and the benefits of work from home, which yielded sharply reduced travel and meeting expense as well as consulting expenses in our fourth quarter. As it became apparent that store closures and social distancing measures would move beyond China to be adopted around the world, we implemented even more cost actions that will have a more meaningful impact on curtailment of expenses beginning in May. These primarily include furloughs and other leaves of absence as well as temporary reduction in compensation for management and board members.  The capabilities we have built and the actions we are taking now enable us to manage through the situation today while funding targeted strategic investments going forward, which will position us well to emerge strongly when the recovery is more apparent. Our interest expense rose by $11 million to $28 million during the quarter, reflecting higher debt levels to finance the acquisition of Dr. Jart+. Our effective tax rate increased to 30.5% from 22.1% in last year's third quarter, primarily attributable to a higher effective rate on the company's foreign operations due to the mix of earnings.  Adjusted diluted EPS of $0.85 fell 45% compared to the prior year. Currency diluted EPS by $0.01 and the acquisition of Dr. Jart+ diluted EPS by approximately $0.03. During the quarter, we recorded $346 million of impairment charges related to 4 brands and certain freestanding retail stores that have been further challenged by the impact of COVID-19 on consumer demand. We believe that our strong balance sheet and ample liquidity provide core competitive advantages for our company, demonstrating the importance of scale. These position us to not only manage through a crisis but to emerge from it stronger.  During the quarter, we borrowed $1.3 billion under our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility and had $200 million of commercial paper outstanding, ending the quarter with nearly $5 billion in cash and cash equivalents. In April, we issued $700 million of 2.6% 10-year senior notes in order to further enhance our financial flexibility and liquidity and repaid the commercial paper with the remaining capacity under the revolving credit facility. We were able to do all of this while maintaining our strong single A credit rating.  For the 9 months, we generated $1.95 billion in net cash flows from operating activities, an increase of 11% from the prior year. We invested $468 million in capital expenditures and $1.04 billion to acquire the remaining interest in Dr. Jart+. We also used $883 million to repurchase shares and $502 million to pay dividends. To further enhance near-term liquidity, we are focusing our capital investment on areas necessary for future growth and paring back in areas such as retail renovations and office improvements. We cut our planned capital expenditures by 1/3 and now expect to spend between $600 million and $650 million for the full year.  Additionally, we have suspended share repurchases for the balance of this fiscal year and our quarterly dividend that would have been paid in June of 2020. All of these activities greatly enhance our ability to manage through the shutdown in brick-and-mortar for an extended period of time while we focus on stimulating greater consumption online.  History has not provided any truly comparable recent events we can use as guidance concerning the effects of the global pandemic. The disruption to our business caused by COVID-19 has clearly been more widespread and more pronounced than we had expected it would be when we last spoke with you just a few months ago in February. We delivered remarkably strong double-digit growth in sales and adjusted EPS through January, but that was followed by the dramatic spread of the pandemic and the related door closings and curtailment of travel that we spoke about.  Due to the fluidity of the situation, it is both complex and difficult to predict the duration or the timing and trajectory of the recovery and the corresponding impact on our business. At this point, in the fourth quarter, the majority of our distribution, with the exception of China and a few other markets, remains closed. And while we are encouraged by the weekly acceleration of our global online business, we do not have enough visibility into the progression of the rest of the business until more retail doors open in the coming months. And we do believe traffic could initially return at a slower pace as some consumers remain tentative until a treatment is developed.  Therefore, given the level of uncertainty, we are not providing explicit sales and EPS guidance for the year. That said, there are a few guideposts that we can provide to you. The inclusion of 6 months of sales from the acquisition of Dr. Jart+ should add about 1 percentage point to sales growth for the year. It is expected to dilute EPS by about $0.14 due to purchase accounting. Currency translation is expected to negatively affect reported sales growth by 1 percentage point, reflecting weighted average rates of $1.11 for the euro, $1.26 for the pound and $7.03 for the won for the fiscal year. The related EPS dilution should be approximately $0.05.  We are very encouraged as we see the beginnings of recovery in China and markets around the world begin to discuss gradually lifting retail and travel restrictions as the virus abates. We expect strong online acceleration to continue as underlying consumer demand is driving both replenishment and new customers online. However, unlike the third quarter where many of our global doors were opened until the last month of the quarter, we expect that most of our retail distribution will remain closed for much of the fourth quarter, and consumer traffic will likely recover slowly in brick-and-mortar. We expect greater sales and margin declines in the fourth quarter as a result. We estimate that global prestige beauty will decline double digits in the second half of our fiscal year.  We are also mindful of the risk of a global recession and a slow recovery in employment impacting consumer sentiment and discretionary spending. Our gross margin in the fourth quarter will reflect the adverse conditions we have been experiencing in March and April. The sudden and dramatic change to our volume forecast is expected to trigger an accounting rule requiring us to recognize the impact of reduced manufacturing volumes on our standard costs. Our plants have been running at meaningfully reduced capacity, reflecting some temporary plant closures as well as reduced efficiencies to accommodate social distancing requirements, staggered shift changes and other changes necessary in this environment.  We are also required to recognize expenses related to manufacturing employees who are not working. These expenses are now recognized in the current period instead of when the product is sold. The inclusion of Dr. Jart+, with the impact of the inventory step-up, will also pressure our gross margin. We expect our belt-tightening efforts to have a more pronounced impact in the fourth quarter to partially offset the negative impacts I've discussed. We are implementing some of the additional actions in May and expect to deliver fourth quarter savings of between $500 million and $600 million. Our full year effective tax rate is expected to be approximately for 24%.  So those are some of the guideposts that we can provide to you for the year. We are committed to continue to take the appropriate actions to rationalize our cost base relative to the new normal and return as quickly as possible to both sales growth and margin expansion as the COVID-19 situation stabilizes during the course of fiscal 2021. We delivered tremendous sales and profit growth through the first half of the year as our business continued to benefit from the strategic actions we took over the past several years to position our company for sustainable, profitable growth. And while the unfortunate temporary shock of COVID-19 has made our outlook for the balance of this year uncertain, we have taken appropriate action to mitigate the effects of the pandemic while continuing to protect our business to be able to be well positioned for both the near-term recovery and the long-term opportunities inherent in global prestige beauty.  On behalf of Fabrizio and the Este\u0301e Lauder Company's leadership team, we extend our immense gratitude to all of our employees around the world for their extraordinary efforts to manage during this unprecedented period. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time. And Steve, to your question on the cost savings and the manufacturing variance. The way I would think about that in the fourth quarter, the $500 million to $600 million of cost savings, about 1/3 of it is related to employee actions and the other 2/3 related to other expense areas that we've stepped up in terms of our cost savings, advertising, consulting, travel, et cetera. So that's generally the split in the fourth quarter.  As it relates to our gross profit margin and you saw the impact in the third quarter, we expect that we will continue to see, in the fourth quarter, the impact obviously of the tariffs and of the higher third-party sourcing costs that will impact us in the fourth quarter. In addition to that, I spoke about the under-absorption of some of our overhead and labor costs that we need to expense in the fourth quarter. So the bigger impact will be in the fourth quarter on that. So our gross profit margins will decline further in the fourth quarter related to those onetime issues related to the lower production volumes. As we increase production volumes as we emerge out of COVID-19, that will correct itself. Then on our infrastructure as well as our plans for holiday, clearly, we are mindful of and watching very closely in terms of as doors open, the productivity of those doors. So certainly, both with our retail partners as well as our own freestanding stores, just making sure as doors open, that they are productive, that they are profitable. And we will, as we have over the last few years, take appropriate actions if we find that we do emerge out of this with brick-and-mortar doors that are less profitable than we would like for them to be.  As it relates to holiday, at the same time, one of the things that Fabrizio, when he was speaking about online, the inference there is we are very much focused on the fact that demand remains strong. And it's really the access to our products that has become challenging in markets like in Europe as well as in the Americas. So lots of activity or programs shifting to online really to make sure that people can access our products. We also are focused on, for holiday, what we think holiday will be like. We actually are hoping that by holiday, things stabilize a bit. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we are mindful that there could be a recession, certainly impact, but hoping that by holiday, people are ready to shop again. So our holiday programs remain intact. The quantities may be adjusted a bit, given how much demand has come back by that time. Sure. So I mean in January, as Fabrizio mentioned, we actually saw positive growth in all of our markets, including in the Americas. We actually started to see some softness towards the end of February. And to your point, the doors were not closed but certainly, it was apparent by that time that COVID-19 was starting to spread, and consumers were starting to get a bit nervous about shopping in-store and really focusing on stocking up on more essentials. And then March, we saw the biggest impact obviously with the doors closed, half of March, but really the early part of March, a tremendous decline in shopping because of the tentativeness of the consumer and really the consumer focused understandably so on health and essentials for their homes and their families. And as far as the inventory in the trade, in our -- with our wholesale customers, clearly with stores closed 6 to 7 weeks, I would say the early part of the door closures we saw -- we started to see a slow pickup in online. And as we indicated, it has really progressed. So certainly, our retailers, those that can share inventory between their brick-and-mortar and their online sites have been drawn down on some of the store -- inventory planned for stores on their retailer.com sites. And we've seen those progress quite nicely and sales really picking up strongly in the last 2 to 3 weeks in particular.  So as doors open, we expect that from a shipment standpoint, we'll see a slow reorder from a replenishment standpoint, certainly from some of the move -- the fast movers that have moved most quickly on retailer.com sites. But as the quarter progresses, we would expect shipments to gradually strengthen throughout the quarter, and by June, really be much stronger. So as you know, Dana, as we've announced, we have taken some short-term cost actions to improve the liquidity situation, and we announced those in the middle of April and so those are some of the employee actions that we've taken. And then some of the other actions are also short term as it relates to advertising, really rightsizing more our advertising to the current sales trends, which will obviously pick up as our sales trends pick up.  There are other areas like travel. I think we're all getting used to the ability to work from home and communicate online. And so there are other areas that are more discretionary that we certainly are looking at more permanently, having cost reductions in some of those other cost areas. So -- but it's something that, as you know, we have ongoing cost management programs in addition to the program for Leading Beauty Forward, we have other cost actions, and we take advantage of the opportunities that we see to lock in savings whenever we can."

All net sales growth numbers are in constant currency. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investors section of our website. During the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit to one question, so we can respond to all of you within the time scheduled for this call. And now, I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio.\nFabrizio Freda: Thank you, Rainey, and good morning to everyone. We delivered exceptional results in the second quarter, which I will elaborate on shortly. But first I want to acknowledge how concerned we are for all the people including our employee and consumers who are affected by the recent outbreak of the coronavirus in China and around the world. Our hearts go out to them and I will discuss what steps our company is taking to support them in a few minutes. In the second quarter, our prestige beauty portfolio resonated with consumers globally. Our successful strategy based on multiple engines of growth once again helped fuel our performance as we grew in all regions and all major categories. Skin care rose in every region as did fragrance and hair care while makeup grew internationally. The company generated 16% constant currency sales growth, the highest organic growth rate in 20 years in the seasonally largest quarter of our fiscal year allowing us to gain significant share in global prestige beauty. While our second quarter continues to be boosted by holiday, it now also includes another important event driver Singles Day. Our advanced planning for these events delivered strong growth across our business led by Asia/Pacific region, the global online and travel retail channels and the skincare and fragrance categories powered by the extraordinary performance of Est\u00e9e Lauder, La Mer and our luxury and artisanal fragrance brands. With disciplined expense management, we leverage our sales growth into a 21% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share. Our strong performance reflected smart and deliberate investments in the best opportunities worldwide including focused product innovations, increased advertising, enhanced digital marketing, better use of data analytics, a greater local relevance. We attracted a broader group of consumers and continued to build strong repeat rates for our products driving greater loyalty. During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of the Korean-based Have & Be Company after having taken a minority stake four years ago. It\u2019s Dr. Jart+ skin care brand has grown rapidly with cutting-edge innovation and excellent speed to market capabilities. We are optimistic about our first acquisition in Asia and we see many opportunities to further cultivate the brand globally as consumer interest in skin care continues to expand. Our momentum continued in the first three weeks of January. But as you all know, the global environment has changed meaningfully, following the outbreak of the coronavirus. Our thoughts are with individuals who have been diagnosis and those who are more than a family in France. The Chinese government has responded in a very serious manner along with many other countries and organization and they are working entirely to address and contain the outbreak and help those afflicted. As a company, we are focused on the well-being of our employees in China and globally and are taking appropriate measures to protect them based on guidance from local authorities and the World Health Organization. Our consumer and business partners in China and elsewhere are also top of mind and we actively engage its way to support them. We are pledging RMB5 million to support coronavirus release effort for needs across China. We are matching donations of U.S. based employees to assist with the outbreak. We are working on various support initiatives to support people and their recovery. Over the past 10 years in my role as CEO, I've made numerous trips to many regions of China. I met with our local employees, talked to consumers of all ages and conferred with our business partners. I travel all over to learn more about its beautiful country its wonderful people. My heart goes out to the citizens of China during this difficult time, and I look forward to my next trip there hopefully in the near future. Although, it is difficult to anticipate the full impact of the coronavirus on our business, we expect the next couple of months will be very challenging. Chinese consumers in many big cities are staying home. And retailers are closing stores or limiting hours, in an effort to help contain the spread of the virus. Additionally, global travel is being restricted. And the effect is being felt beyond China, into major travel retail corridors and large tourist cities. Given what we know now and our experience with past epidemics, we believe our business will gradually recover towards the end of the fiscal year. We stand ready, to invest, to facilitate the recovery as soon as the market supports it, leveraging the flexibility of our resource allocation and our multiple growth drivers. We remain committed to China and to the Chinese consumers for the long-term. And plan to increase our R&D investment in the market, in order to drive both breakthrough, prestige beauty innovation for China, the Asia/Pacific region and the rest of the world. Reflecting China leadership in science, we will expand upon our existing in-market capability. And build a new state-of-art innovation center, complete with the latest technologies and tools. This facility will also highlight our passion and commitment to quality, sustainability and employee wellness. Our enhanced capability and capacity will ensure we meet the needs of Chinese and Asia consumers, with local relevancy and local trends, as well as with creativity, agility and speed. These investment aims to sustain the long-term development of our company in China, and around the world. We will continue working to advance this new development. And look forward to sharing more details in the future. Turning back to the second quarter results, the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand was again a star, in our portfolio. The brand grew strong double-digits globally, in both skin care and makeup and rose in every region, powered by its main hero franchises, including Advanced Night Repair as well as Re-Nutriv, Revitalizing Supreme, Micro Essence and Double Wear. This is a beautiful example of our multiple engines, not only winning across many brands, but also within a big brand. Re-Nutriv, Est\u00e9e Lauder luxury skin care line delivered superb results, supported by targeted marketing, with the luxury consumer, enhanced merchandising and desirable innovation. Looking now at our geographic results, sales advanced in every region with strength across categories. In Asia/Pacific, virtually every market grew, led by China, which accelerated, generating strong double-digit growth as all our brands, category and channels advanced. We had terrific growth from smaller cities in China, which are becoming a greater part of our business, and a promising long-term growth driver. We expanded into two new cities, bringing our total to 123. Our online business in China more than doubled, elevated by well-integrated online and offline campaigns for Singles Day. The Est\u00e9e Lauder brand was among Tmall best performers for the event, while M\u2022A\u2022C, La Mer and Jo Malone London, each excelled in their respective categories. Our brand expansion strategy on Tmall was a distinct advantage. As an example, following Tom Ford Beauty launched, on Tmall in 2019, the brand executed its first Singles Day to tremendous success in both fragrance and makeup. Its performance was twice that of its Tmall launch day which was our biggest launch ever on the platform. Chinese consumer interest in prestige fragrance category is rising and we are nicely positioned with our wide portfolio of luxury fragrances. Jo Malone London and Tom Ford Beauty excelled in the quarter, helping to further diversify our business in China. We plan to launch additional luxury fragrance there later this year. We delivered strong growth in our other emerging markets, outside of China, led by terrific results in Russia, India, Thailand and Brazil. In the quarter, we continue to invest for growth and attract new consumers. For example, Brazil is the fourth largest market globally for hair care. And we launched Aveda, our 10th brand there. We are showcasing the brand historical commitment to sustainability, the environment and botanically-based product, with a salon in S\u00e3o Paulo that includes sustainable elements. Across Europe the Middle East and Africa, Est\u00e9e Lauder, M\u2022A\u2022C, Clinique and La Mer, our four biggest brands, prospered demonstrating the appeal of established brands that have broad exposure to multiple subcategories and compelling innovation. Every category advanced in the region. Our skin care brand led the growth with sought-after newness from La Mer, Darphin and Origins. And the U.K. grew modestly, for the second consecutive quarter in a difficult environment and several of our brands gained share. Our growth strategy are showing promise amid macro industry-specific headwinds. In North America, we made good progress towards stabilization of the business. We learned -- we leaned into our multiple engines of growth, leveraging our successful skincare and fragrance franchises during the holiday season, in light of industry challenges in makeup. There were several bright spots. Brand representing about half of our sales grew and we had gains in the specialty-multi and online channels. In fact, La Mer delivered record Black Friday sales on its own site, driven by unique product assortment and an influencer-led holiday campaign. As we work to rejuvenate the makeup business in North America we are creating products that leverage consumer insight from our enhanced data analytics. For example, we learned consumers want product that combine skincare benefits with makeup. In response, the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand just launched Futurist Hydra Rescue, a new moisturizing foundation, combining the positioning of our winning Futurist franchise in China with consumer needs in North America. The launch is off to a very strong start, with high ratings and reviews. Looking now at the channels. Our global online business delivered stellar results. Our brand sites, third-party sites and retailer sites, all grew double-digit, with broad-based strength across regions. Our online business was vibrant globally around Cyber Monday, as our brands offered well-received products and set in the important holiday gifting given season. We continue to invest in our excellent growth prospects online. We launched our brands on more third-party sites which are rising in popularity, deploy new digital payment technologies across several of our brand sites in the U.S. and expanded our loyalty programs. We reach engaged content. We have increased the time consumers spend on our brand sites and traffic has grown, increasing the inherent media value these sites provide. Travel Retail also continued its momentum. Our top eight brands grew double digits at retail, with strengths in skin care and our luxury and our artisanal fragrance brands grew strongly, aided by expanded distribution in the channel. Innovative pre-retail campaign, unique retailers' activision and effective advertising, all contributed to fantastic results. The pretail segment of Travel Retail excelled in the quarter and is becoming an increasingly important part of our business. Pretail enable us to engage with consumers before they travel, build brand equity and desirability and drive conversion. When tourism and travel resume, following containment of the coronavirus, we anticipate that pretail will continue to start. Another important highlight this quarter was the publication of our 2019 Citizenship and Sustainability Report. Last March we announced new goals and the report details our vision and progress. One of our goals is to promote ingredient transparency across our brands and Aveda led the way with an ingredient velocity on its websites. Other brands will soon follow. Innovation is the core of our company, once again helped drive our performance, accounting for over 25% of sales. We have exciting innovation from our four biggest brands coming in the second half of our fiscal year, many in their hero franchises. We believe these launches will be well received by consumers globally and these important franchises have high loyalty. We are pleased by our strong start in the first half and we are now focused on managing effectively throughout the coronavirus outbreak. We are determined to serve our consumers in the best ways possible. We believe that the efforts of the Chinese government along with leadership from around the world to contain the outbreak will prove effective. I want to thank our employees worldwide to their extraordinary efforts working through this challenging time, while supporting each other, our consumers, the communities where we work and our business. Their grace and agility are a testament to our company culture. Now, I will turn the call over to Tracey.\nTracey Travis: Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. Certainly, our thoughts and best wishes are with everyone managing through a very difficult situation in China and globally. We are committed to supporting our employees and other stakeholders, while we also manage the business impact as best we can during this time. As a reminder, my commentary today is adjusted for the items that Rainey mentioned at the beginning of the call and net sales growth numbers are in constant currency. We acquired Have & Be the owner of the Dr. Jart+ brand towards the end of December. The results for the new brand will be recorded in future periods on a one month lag, so you can expect operating results from Dr. Jart+ to be reflected in our fiscal third quarter for the first time, including the impact of purchase accounting and the interest expense on the debt we issued largely to fund this acquisition. So starting with the quarter results. Net sales for the second quarter rose 16% driven by strong growth in our international regions and improvement in North America. Sales growth in Asia, travel retail and online continue to exceed our expectations. From a geographic standpoint, our Asia Pacific region net sales rose 30% with broad-based growth across the region. Sales in Greater China accelerated, rising very strong double-digits. Our sales in Mainland China continued to deliver broad-based growth across cities, brands, categories and channels and our brands saw record results on Singles Day. As expected, sales on Hong Kong declined more than 20%. Among developed markets in APAC, we again delivered double-digit sales growth in Korea this quarter. Our sales in Japan rose mid-single digits despite the October 1st, VAT increase last year that contributed to double-digit growth last quarter. And emerging markets in Southeast Asia grew high-single-digits led by Thailand. Net sales in our Europe, the Middle East and Africa region rose 18% with most markets contributing to growth. Our global travel retail business rose strong double-digits driven largely by like-door growth the continued rapid development of online pre-ordering and the successful introduction of newer brands like Le Labo and KILIAN. Emerging markets in the region grew double-digits led by India and Russia. Western European markets grew low to mid-single digits led by Italy, Iberia and Germany. Net sales in the Americas rose 1%, a significant improvement from last quarter. Skin care and fragrance showed good growth driven by Est\u00e9e Lauder, Origins and La Mer as well as strong holiday performances from Jo Malone and Tom Ford. Initial shipments of Est\u00e9e Lauder's new Futurist Hydra Rescue Moisturizing Makeup launch helped to partially offset the overall continued weakness in the makeup category. In North America, sales rose high-single-digits across all our online channels. Our sales in the specialty-multi channel grew double-digits, while the brick-and-mortar department store business remained challenged. From a category standpoint, skin care once again led growth this quarter. Net sales accelerated to 28% growth with strong contributions from Est\u00e9e Lauder, La Mer, Origins and Clinique. Innovations such as Est\u00e9e Lauder Advanced Night Repair Intense Reset Concentrate La Mer The Regenerating Serum and Clinique iD BB-gel contributed incremental sales and supported their hero franchises. Net sales in makeup grew 7% led by Est\u00e9e Lauder, Tom Ford and Bobbi Brown. Solid innovation and support in foundation and lip products, as well as special holiday sets and products drove growth in the category. Sales of fragrances grew 9% driven by strong holiday activations at Jo Malone, London and the launch of Metallique from Tom Ford. Fragrance sales grew across all regions, but were strongest in the Americas and in Asia. Our hair care sales rose 5% driven by the launch of the Nutriplenish line of products from Aveda and improvement at Bumble and bumble. Our gross margin increased 20 basis points compared to the second quarter last year. Favorable pricing and mix was partially offset by the impact of the incremental tariffs and higher obsolescence costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved 130 basis points. We continue to leverage higher sales and greater efficiencies in our selling model and store operating costs to fund advertising and strategic investments in technology and other capabilities. Operating income rose 23% and operating margin increased by 150 basis points. Adjusted diluted EPS of $2.11, increased 21% compared to the prior year, and the currency translation impact was negligible. EPS was higher than expected due to the stronger sales growth as well as disciplined expense management and was partially offset by a slightly higher tax rate. During the quarter, we acquired the remaining stake in Have & Be, the Korean-based skin care company. The transaction resulted in a one-time gain of $576 million, primarily related to the re-measurement of our previously held minority equity investment to fair value. We also recorded $777 million of impairment charges related to three of our four makeup brands a reflection of the continued challenges in the makeup category that have been most prevalent in North America. While the market momentum for makeup has slowed in the near term as we have previously discussed, the growth opportunities and the strategic value of these brands remains compelling as evidenced by our increased share and capability in specialty-multi retail the enhanced social media expertise of the brand and an increased consumer base of Gen-Z and millennials. Turning now to cash flow. For the six months, we generated $1.26 billion in net cash flows from operating activities, which was roughly flat with the prior year. Higher earnings were offset primarily by the timing and level of accounts payable. We invested $291 million in capital expenditures with cash and $1.04 billion to acquire the remaining equity interest in Have & Be, which was funded with debt. We also continue to return cash to stockholders by utilizing $813 million to repurchase 4.3 million shares of our stock and $330 million to pay dividends. So we ended the first six months of the fiscal year with strong net sales growth of 14% in constant currency and adjusted EPS growth of 21%, a tremendous reflection of the hard work of our teams as well as strong consumer momentum that we have in our markets. So now let's turn to our outlook for the balance of this year. The strong performance in the first half of our fiscal year, our multiple engines of growth strategy and the greater financial flexibility and agility we have built into our operating model is expected to help us to effectively manage through the short-term disruption caused by the Coronavirus outbreak. Due to the rapid escalation and the fluidity of the situation, it is both complex and difficult to predict the timing and the corresponding impact on our business. Therefore, we are not giving explicit guidance for the third quarter. We also remain mindful that a variety of macro risks such as ongoing trade tensions and continued challenges in Hong Kong's retail environment could impact our second half results. For the year -- for the fiscal year, we now strive to achieve net sales growth of at least 6% to 8% in constant currency. This range is before the impact of one point of growth from the inclusion of sales from Have & Be. Currency translation is expected to negatively affect reported sales growth by 1 percentage point reflecting weighted average rates of $1.10 for the euro, $1.27 for the pound and 7.03 for the won for the fiscal year. With this sales guidance, EPS is expected to range between $5.60 and $5.70 before restructuring and other charges. This includes approximately $0.05 of dilution from currency translation and $0.18 dilution from the Have & Be acquisition. In constant currency, we expect EPS growth of 6% to 8%. Excluding the dilution from Have & Be, EPS growth is expected to be at least 9% to 11%, which remains in line with our long-term objectives. For the second half, net sales are expected to increase approximately 1% to 2% in constant currency. Currency translation is expected to negatively impact growth by 1 percentage point and the inclusion of Have & Be is expected to add 2 percentage points. In terms of cadence throughout the second half we have anticipated the greatest negative sales impact from the Coronavirus to be in the third quarter followed by a gradual recovery in the fourth quarter. We are severely curtailing discretionary costs, while continuing to support critical areas of growth. Leading Beauty Forward has reduced our percentage of fixed cost in our operations, which gives us greater agility to manage more effectively with slowing sales. We expect the belt tightening to have the maximum benefit in the fourth quarter. EPS is forecast between $1.86 and $1.91 before restructuring charges. This includes approximately $0.03 dilution from currency and $0.17 dilution from Have & Be, which includes some impact from the Coronavirus outbreak, purchase accounting and interest expense on the debt issuance as I mentioned previously. While our outlook for the balance of this year is uncertain, we do remain quite optimistic about the long-term growth opportunities for the company. We believe we can manage through this difficult health prices while maintaining the agility to invest as needed and regain our momentum once the recovery is established. On behalf of the entire Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies, we extend our deepest well wishes to those who have been affected and thank everyone for their extraordinary efforts to manage during this period particularly our incredibly hardworking and wonderful team in China. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time.\nOperator: The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. \nDara Mohsenian: Hi. Good morning, guys. So just was hoping for a bit more clarity on the Coronavirus and how you guys are thinking about the potential impact longer term. I guess what we've seen with past epidemics is usually beauty demands come back pretty quickly after a couple of quarters. I know there's not a lot of visibility here and the duration of illness is obviously still a big wildcard. But just to retail any initial thoughts or context on if you think this could be an issue that impairs longer-term growth as we look out over the next few years? You talked about a gradual recovery through fiscal year end. Should we expect things to sort of ramp-up pretty quickly after that? Or how are you thinking about it in terms of longevity of impact? Thanks.\nFabrizio Freda: So obviously, we don't know about the specific medical health recovery timing, which is the unknown at this point. But we are in agreement with your assumption, which is basically this will have an impact in the short term and definition of short term is what is unknown today. But then after this period, there will be a recovery and people will come gradually back to normal habits. And so, we do expect to recover our momentum at the end of the health crisis. And in terms of our assumption today are in line with what you said. We assume the two quarters to be affected by the impact and we expect a normalization in fiscal year '21. That's our assumption today. The other important thing is that, we are ready to stay close to the current mitigation of the issue and resolution of the health classes as we are doing, supporting our China team and all the activities that the government is putting in place in China today. And we also will stand ready to support the recovery when the recovery will be happening and to invest behind the recovery as required by the market opportunity, but most importantly, by the needs of rebuilding the right consumption of Chinese consumers in the name of the economical development of China.\nDara Mohsenian: Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will come from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping we'd talk actually a little bit about the Americas because the strength this quarter, the inflection was very notable. So I was wondering, if you could talk a bit more about how much you think this is tied to just being really proactive in promoting and getting behind I should say in fragrance and skin and holiday being the key to this. Or are you starting to see other lift that you think can carry through past holiday? And then in part with that of course we've had the news about incremental Macy's door closures this week. So, if you can just comment on the outlook for the rest of the year in the Americas. Thanks.\nFabrizio Freda: So, first of all, in -- as we said this quarter has contributed to the stabilization of our North America business and this has been in line with the strategy we communicated in Investor Day. And we remain committed and to continue the work of stabilization in the next months. So what happened this quarter is, first of all, we have used as anticipated much more granular insight in the market to activate our plans and much more local relevance in the activation. The other thing that happened, we have recognized the softness of the overall makeup market and that's why we have accelerated our activity in skin care and particularly fragrances during the holiday season that we have well fitting the situation and we got great results. So, we had -- if you want adjusted our engines of growth in a way that contributed to the good results. Our innovation pipeline as anticipated has been strong and the impact of innovation has improved. And so, all this have been a positive impact. We will continue to operate in that direction, but we do have still to be confront some of the headwinds. To be clear, the makeup softness, particularly the color makeup softness is continuing. As you mentioned, the closures of certain retailing stores where we do have high market share will continue although we completely share the Macy's strategy of focusing on the high-performance doors and/or gradually stopping the smaller and lower performance doors with -- as I said, we support the strategy, but obviously we will need to operate with the strategy with making sure that we retain the consumer -- the brands. And this will be difficult, but we will do our best to do that. So we need to take under account our extraordinary efforts to improve our model that are working, but also take under account there will continue to be headwinds. So our strategy remains at this point stabilization.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. And just as a follow-up, how are you thinking about the impact of Chinese travelers not really visiting the U.S. over the next several months just in terms of the outlook?\nFabrizio Freda: That's actually a good point. We assume that there will be obviously an important reduction of Chinese travelers not visiting the U.S. in the next at least two, three months and this will have a negative impact obviously on the sales to Chinese tourists. Frankly, in this moment we are assuming in our guidance also a slowdown on any travel population. To be clear in this moment because of the coronavirus global concern, tourists in general is being reduced temporary. So, we are taking this temporary assumption -- sorry the assumption of this temporary reduction under account in our guidance.\nLauren Lieberman: Okay. Great. Thanks, so much.\nTracey Travis: And I just want to add as it relates to our guidance. I mentioned the range of $1.82 to $1.91 which is within our press release. I think I mentioned a different number in our guidance for the second half.\nOperator: The next question is from Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nMichael Binetti: Hey guys. Thanks for taking our question and congrats on a really good quarter. So, I want to ask you on the Dr. Jart+ dilution. Could you walk us through how much the $0.18 -- we're trying to think forward I guess over the four quarters of integrating that business, how much of that is one-time in nature? And when do you see that starting to wear off or even possibly turn to an accretive position? And then I just -- I want to ask you as you think through the U.S. number a little bit, so do you think the retailers that you worked with on the holiday strategy to get more skin care and fragrance out there? They really seem to want to keep pushing on makeup even as the warning signs were showing up over the last year or two. Do you think they've gone through the psychological change yet that skin care is going to be the driver for the medium term? And are they accepting that they have to pull back more on makeup in a structural way? I guess are the gains you saw in skin care and fragrance, would you characterize those as sticky and shelf space gains that are going to remain dedicated to those categories as we look into calendar 2020?\nTracey Travis: Yes. So, starting with the Have & Be dilution, we obviously have the step-up in inventory which is one-time depends on how you're treating the interest expense which is also in that number. What I would say Michael is that we expect that Have & Be will be, if you think forward, relatively flat including purchase accounting. So, eliminating those onetime items next year and accretive the following year.\nMichael Binetti: Okay.\nTracey Travis: The makeup question is the second question?\nMichael Binetti: Yes.\nFabrizio Freda: Sorry could you repeat who was the subject to the makeup when you said they? I didn't understand.\nMichael Binetti: Yes. Well, it sounds like it was a pretty meaningful acceleration. Obviously in North America or in America we can see your numbers. But it sounds like the number that you got from specialty-multi which was a great growth channel for you guys over the last few years, but slowed recently sounds like it improved a lot this quarter and it sounds like you worked with them on skin care. And I'm just wondering if you feel like that channel they feel like they've gone through the mental change of saying, look skin care is going to be the bigger driver and we're going to give them -- give that category more shelf space that sticks around calendar 2020.\nFabrizio Freda: I -- frankly, yes, I think everyone realizes the power of skin care in this moment and we are all working together to leverage the power of skin care also because skin care for instant results and skincare product combined with makeup is on a growth. So, there are -- yes you speak about shelf space which obviously is a bit more gradual in the way it changes. But definitely innovation programs are reflecting a lot of this. So, there is more activity, more social media, more advertising in skin care than before and this is a reflection on the results. By the way makeup is a big category. The makeup for face meaning foundation for example is still doing very, very well. The place which is softer is color. And importantly, what we are doing to contribute not only to leverage skincare fragrances better but to reinstate growth in makeup in the future is we have accelerated the innovation in the makeup category contributing to the future results of our retail partners also in this category. So, to be clear, we are not giving up at all on makeup. We are just accepting that in the short-term, we are focusing more on other category and innovating better in makeup to reactivate the consumer interest.\nMichael Binetti: Thank you very much. Congrats on getting North America back to positive.\nFabrizio Freda: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will come from Erinn Murphy with Piper Sandler.\nErinn Murphy: Great. Thanks. Good morning and let me add my congratulations. I guess my question is around Amazon. There's been some press out recently talking about them potentially evolving their model to launch some luxury brands, maybe using a concession model. If something like this was to play out, would you ever consider -- or reconsider, excuse me, Amazon as a channel for luxury beauty? And then just a follow-up on China. Can you share, Tracey, maybe what percent of physical doors have been shuttered? And are you seeing any major change in trend in the online business in China since the outbreak has escalated? Thank you.\nFabrizio Freda: Okay. On the first question is -- the answer is no. At this point, we are not considering Amazon, a channel for our luxury beauty products and we are focusing of our current channels and our current partners to build a continued stabilization in North America of our business. As far as the China question, is the number of physical doors, I'll let Tracey go with that.\nTracey Travis: Yes. So, as you can imagine it's quite fluid. And one of the things that we've seen is the Chinese New Year extended for many, many of our employees. Our stores have closed as malls have closed. So, very recently two-thirds of our department store doors were closed and the remaining doors were on reduced hours. Now that could change next week, so this is a very fluid situation.\nFabrizio Freda: And on the second part of the China question which is the online, absolutely the online channel is very strong in China and as we said in the second quarter. But in this moment also online is suffering because in this moment in the middle of the outbreak, the delivery system in homes and in the big distribution centers also people are now working like in this moment until February 10th, many people with non-essential activity in factories in other situation this is stopped. The same is for distribution centers the same for other activities. So online in -- at least in the short-term is having the same issues of brick-and-mortar. In terms of the role of online in the recovery in the future, we are optimistic that online will play a very strong role in the recovery when the recovery will happen.\nErinn Murphy: Thank you for that context. All the best.\nFabrizio Freda: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will come from Steve Strycula with UBS. Please go ahead.\nSteve Strycula: Hi. Good morning. So, first part of my question just wanted to follow-up on Erinn's question. Can you give us a little bit more texture as to how to disaggregate how Mainland China sales are performing versus the travel retail component of the business? Primarily it's how we think about modeling the back half of the year. One of those businesses is housed within the EMEA segment. The other business is clearly housing APAC. So just want to get a little bit more texture as to which ones being more impacted real time. And then Fabrizio, if you use history as a guide post here, how do we think about once the issue is call it \"contained\" what is like the recovery path off from that moment forward? Is it typically from what you've seen before three months, four months for travel retail to come back online from flights being booked? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.\nFabrizio Freda: Yeah. So the short answer to the first question in this moment travel retail is the most impacted channel. Because if you think what -- just to give you the context of what's happening, you will probably know that more than 60 airlines just closed their flights. So in this moment the travel in and out of China is suspended in the large majority of cases. So there is lack of traffic for -- just in and out of China. Second, in general tourism in this moment is more prudent, because it's a global issue. The outbreak is a global concern. And so many people which are concerned to travel in this moment are reducing their choice or postponing some of the travel. And I'm speaking touristic travel. Then there is a third factor. Many companies have banned travel to any place -- to China, but also to any other place where there is the virus. And so business travel is being reduced not to count the many companies are reducing business travel for cost containment reasons. So in this moment, the amount of travel in airports is reduced and traffic is significantly reduced. So that's the biggest impact. The second biggest impact is obviously China Mainland itself and Hong Kong, which have reduced significance. So I would say the Greater China area, because of all the reasons that we have already discussed in the prepared remarks that I'm not going to repeat. But the most important thing is that keep in mind that until February 10 most of the cities are not even -- people are not back to work until at February children are not back to school. And people are requested rightly so not to get out of home for reasons, which are not essential and not going public transportations where there is a risk of contamination. So, the behaviors of the entire population is fundamentally changed. And because of this, this is the second area where in the short-term we expect an impact. The second part of your question is the recovery. Now the recovery we know what you know. We have studied all the previous cases in all the previous situation. And what we see is that the recovery tends to be hockey sticks, meaning, when the things is back, it's back particularly in the traveling. When traffic is back, traffic is back and the people buy. The thing that can -- that we can do more in terms of the business learning that we're applying or during the period before the recovery in travel retail will be very important to push conversion, meaning, when there is -- travel retail is built by traffic and by conversion. Conversion is an area where we're making many improvements. So in this period of transition where traffic will be low, we are reworking our plans to use conversion as a key mitigating element of the deep and then obviously we are preparing for future recovery plans when the time will arrive. The last point I want to make is that we will try to tune the recovery to the recovery of the Chinese economy and the Chinese population. We don't want just to look this as a business. We want to see -- look at this as a contribution to the recovery of the country and really supporting our employees at the country in this. And the same will happen in travel retail where for example some of our customers and retail partners are Chinese. And we are going to stay close to them to contribute to the recovery of the travel retail business to make sure that our long-term retail partners will benefit from the recovery much -- as much as possible and to start this all again to restart the right process and to regain momentum not only for us, but for the entire industry.\nOperator: The next question is from Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you. Good morning. And I just want to echo the congrats on your results.\nFabrizio Freda: Thank you.\nAndrea Teixeira: So as a follow-up on the North America and the comments that you made for mix Fabrizio and obviously there was -- it's natural that in the holidays, it's more giftable skin care and fragrances. And you're also putting more -- I think prudently putting more marketing behind those lines. So do you think that innovation and momentum continue to build into the next few quarters? Or we maybe potentially have some seasonal positive impact of that into the second quarter? Thank you.\nTracey Travis: So I'll start and then Fabrizio can also add his comments. We are progressing towards stabilization in North America. And clearly, it was a strong holiday and strong second quarter for us in North America and in other parts of the globe. So our teams have worked awfully hard to make this holiday season a very good one and consumers responded and we're very happy about that. As we look at the back half of the year, Fabrizio touched on the fact that we do have tourists that we expect that that business to be a bit softer given the situation that we're managing through globally. And I would also say that North America is making progressive progress. However, I would not expect that the second quarter would necessarily be reflective of continued acceleration from there. But the North America team is executing against all of the strategies that were laid out last year and we're seeing some good outcomes from that. So what we told you last quarter was North America, we expect certainly to have better performance this year than we did last year in North America. So that is progression towards stabilization. Lauren asked earlier about the Macy's announcement. And clearly, as we've been saying for some time, we believe that brick-and-mortar needs to be taken out of North America. North America has been over retailed for some time. So we are very much aligned with what Macy's has announced in their Investor Day yesterday. The doors that actually would be closing in our fiscal year were already included in our guidance.\nAndrea Teixeira: That's helpful.\nOperator: The next question will come from Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMark Astrachan: Thanks, and good morning everybody. Just wondering if you could quantify the online percentage of sales from China. And related to that also if you could just quantify the impact benefit from e-commerce accelerating consumption the enhanced availability in China. In other words, previously consumers would have to visit cities selling the product and now you're up to 123. But e-commerce obviously makes the product available everywhere. So maybe if you could just talk a bit about, how you think about that dynamic as having helped past tense sales and how you think about that on a go-forward basis and maybe if you think about some of those Tier 3 to 5 cities, which didn't readily available -- have product readily available, but now people can order online. How do you think about that in terms of accelerating demand, maintaining that demand and kind of how it will impact future growth?\nFabrizio Freda: Yes. No, that's a very good question. As I commented a lot of times on the subject this is a very important phenomenon, because today we have physical distribution in China in 123 city with our most distributed brands which are Lauder and Clinique and much lower city coverage in the other brands, which are still on a growth trajectory. So it is a lot of physical distribution potential in the long-term still untapped. But at the same time, we know there is demand in China now in over 600 cities. So there are over 450 cities where there is strong demand and there is not yet physical distribution of prestige luxury and for sure prestige luxury of Est\u00e9e Lauder brands. So this demand gets filled by online and get filled by -- when there's consumer travel also travel within China like in amazing 3-Tier markets like Hainan Island then where they can access the products or when they travel for internal business or vacation like go to Beijing or to Shanghai. So that's the situation. But online cover a lot these cities and that's why also is growing and is very strategic, because it give us access to these consumers in a very productive way. The other important positive consequence of this dynamic is that the brick-and-mortar can remain very productive. It can remain very focused where there is the right productivity and online can cover productively the rest. So this is a good phenomenon continue to grow. It is definitely one of the reason behind my comment that we are having better and better results also in the Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities also where physical distribution has not yet arrived. In terms of percentage of sales, China is the highest percentage of sales online versus other markets. It's on high side and it's continued to grow.\nOperator: We have time for one more question and that question will come from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.\nNik Modi: Thanks. Thanks for the question. Good morning, everyone. I just wanted to follow-up on Mark's question Fabrizio. How much flexibility do you have to turn up the dial on really focusing on some of those lower tier cities that you just referenced? I'm just thinking about as kind of the year progresses and if you really wanted to turn up the dial to generate sales growth in some of these other tier cities. Do you have that kind of control in the near term? Or is it a much longer-term burn?\nFabrizio Freda: I mean, we have control of the online I mean with our partners like Tmall and obviously, our own online activity. But the \u2013 remember we \u2013 our way to build distribution and also to build coverage is \u2013 we are in luxury. And for us selective distribution, which means demand ahead of supply is very important. So we gradually build the demand. And the reason why today demand is growing so fast also in the city is social media. Because while in the past advertising was local, meaning advertising was focused in the cities where there was physical distribution. Social media by definition is national. So you are in a dynamic where demand is normally ahead of supply and that's the typical demand of the good luxury market and we are filling this demand gradually and making sure that we keep the concept of desirability and high quality and high quality also the experience that we give to our consumer in mind. So we are not selling products. We are selling quality and full experiences and we only do that when we can provide the best possible service to the consumer. So the short answer is gradually, but yes, we have the capability to dial up as the market opportunity reveals itself.\nNik Modi: And just a quick follow-up. Of the 450 cities you cited in China's opportunity, how many do you believe Est\u00e9e Lauder as a company has a very good handle on demand? And just a general consumer insights in those cities?\nFabrizio Freda: So I will not give you specific numbers but I can tell you that we have the consumer data, so we know the number of consumers that are buying from different cities. Even we use these data analytics to decide where to open physical distribution. So we use the demand and the elements of the strength of the demand from the cities also to judge our physical distribution strategy to make sure that we continue to provide better high-touch services to the consumer when the demand is sufficient to be productive and to offer the quality and the service that we need to offer. So it's a gradual development of quality service.\nNik Modi: Very helpful. Thank you.\nFabrizio Freda: Welcome.\nOperator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session.

            "name": "Fabrizio Freda",
            "content": "Thank you, Rainey, and good morning to everyone. We delivered exceptional results in the second quarter, which I will elaborate on shortly. But first I want to acknowledge how concerned we are for all the people including our employee and consumers who are affected by the recent outbreak of the coronavirus in China and around the world. Our hearts go out to them and I will discuss what steps our company is taking to support them in a few minutes. In the second quarter, our prestige beauty portfolio resonated with consumers globally. Our successful strategy based on multiple engines of growth once again helped fuel our performance as we grew in all regions and all major categories. Skin care rose in every region as did fragrance and hair care while makeup grew internationally. The company generated 16% constant currency sales growth, the highest organic growth rate in 20 years in the seasonally largest quarter of our fiscal year allowing us to gain significant share in global prestige beauty. While our second quarter continues to be boosted by holiday, it now also includes another important event driver Singles Day. Our advanced planning for these events delivered strong growth across our business led by Asia/Pacific region, the global online and travel retail channels and the skincare and fragrance categories powered by the extraordinary performance of Este\u0301e Lauder, La Mer and our luxury and artisanal fragrance brands. With disciplined expense management, we leverage our sales growth into a 21% increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share. Our strong performance reflected smart and deliberate investments in the best opportunities worldwide including focused product innovations, increased advertising, enhanced digital marketing, better use of data analytics, a greater local relevance. We attracted a broader group of consumers and continued to build strong repeat rates for our products driving greater loyalty. During the quarter, we completed the acquisition of the Korean-based Have & Be Company after having taken a minority stake four years ago. It's Dr. Jart+ skin care brand has grown rapidly with cutting-edge innovation and excellent speed to market capabilities. We are optimistic about our first acquisition in Asia and we see many opportunities to further cultivate the brand globally as consumer interest in skin care continues to expand. Our momentum continued in the first three weeks of January. But as you all know, the global environment has changed meaningfully, following the outbreak of the coronavirus. Our thoughts are with individuals who have been diagnosis and those who are more than a family in France. The Chinese government has responded in a very serious manner along with many other countries and organization and they are working entirely to address and contain the outbreak and help those afflicted. As a company, we are focused on the well-being of our employees in China and globally and are taking appropriate measures to protect them based on guidance from local authorities and the World Health Organization. Our consumer and business partners in China and elsewhere are also top of mind and we actively engage its way to support them. We are pledging RMB5 million to support coronavirus release effort for needs across China. We are matching donations of U.S. based employees to assist with the outbreak. We are working on various support initiatives to support people and their recovery. Over the past 10 years in my role as CEO, I've made numerous trips to many regions of China. I met with our local employees, talked to consumers of all ages and conferred with our business partners. I travel all over to learn more about its beautiful country its wonderful people. My heart goes out to the citizens of China during this difficult time, and I look forward to my next trip there hopefully in the near future. Although, it is difficult to anticipate the full impact of the coronavirus on our business, we expect the next couple of months will be very challenging. Chinese consumers in many big cities are staying home. And retailers are closing stores or limiting hours, in an effort to help contain the spread of the virus. Additionally, global travel is being restricted. And the effect is being felt beyond China, into major travel retail corridors and large tourist cities. Given what we know now and our experience with past epidemics, we believe our business will gradually recover towards the end of the fiscal year. We stand ready, to invest, to facilitate the recovery as soon as the market supports it, leveraging the flexibility of our resource allocation and our multiple growth drivers. We remain committed to China and to the Chinese consumers for the long-term. And plan to increase our R&D investment in the market, in order to drive both breakthrough, prestige beauty innovation for China, the Asia/Pacific region and the rest of the world. Reflecting China leadership in science, we will expand upon our existing in-market capability. And build a new state-of-art innovation center, complete with the latest technologies and tools. This facility will also highlight our passion and commitment to quality, sustainability and employee wellness. Our enhanced capability and capacity will ensure we meet the needs of Chinese and Asia consumers, with local relevancy and local trends, as well as with creativity, agility and speed. These investment aims to sustain the long-term development of our company in China, and around the world. We will continue working to advance this new development. And look forward to sharing more details in the future. Turning back to the second quarter results, the Este\u0301e Lauder brand was again a star, in our portfolio. The brand grew strong double-digits globally, in both skin care and makeup and rose in every region, powered by its main hero franchises, including Advanced Night Repair as well as Re-Nutriv, Revitalizing Supreme, Micro Essence and Double Wear. This is a beautiful example of our multiple engines, not only winning across many brands, but also within a big brand. Re-Nutriv, Este\u0301e Lauder luxury skin care line delivered superb results, supported by targeted marketing, with the luxury consumer, enhanced merchandising and desirable innovation. Looking now at our geographic results, sales advanced in every region with strength across categories. In Asia/Pacific, virtually every market grew, led by China, which accelerated, generating strong double-digit growth as all our brands, category and channels advanced. We had terrific growth from smaller cities in China, which are becoming a greater part of our business, and a promising long-term growth driver. We expanded into two new cities, bringing our total to 123. Our online business in China more than doubled, elevated by well-integrated online and offline campaigns for Singles Day. The Este\u0301e Lauder brand was among Tmall best performers for the event, while M\u2022A\u2022C, La Mer and Jo Malone London, each excelled in their respective categories. Our brand expansion strategy on Tmall was a distinct advantage. As an example, following Tom Ford Beauty launched, on Tmall in 2019, the brand executed its first Singles Day to tremendous success in both fragrance and makeup. Its performance was twice that of its Tmall launch day which was our biggest launch ever on the platform. Chinese consumer interest in prestige fragrance category is rising and we are nicely positioned with our wide portfolio of luxury fragrances. Jo Malone London and Tom Ford Beauty excelled in the quarter, helping to further diversify our business in China. We plan to launch additional luxury fragrance there later this year. We delivered strong growth in our other emerging markets, outside of China, led by terrific results in Russia, India, Thailand and Brazil. In the quarter, we continue to invest for growth and attract new consumers. For example, Brazil is the fourth largest market globally for hair care. And we launched Aveda, our 10th brand there. We are showcasing the brand historical commitment to sustainability, the environment and botanically-based product, with a salon in Sa\u0303o Paulo that includes sustainable elements. Across Europe the Middle East and Africa, Este\u0301e Lauder, M\u2022A\u2022C, Clinique and La Mer, our four biggest brands, prospered demonstrating the appeal of established brands that have broad exposure to multiple subcategories and compelling innovation. Every category advanced in the region. Our skin care brand led the growth with sought-after newness from La Mer, Darphin and Origins. And the U.K. grew modestly, for the second consecutive quarter in a difficult environment and several of our brands gained share. Our growth strategy are showing promise amid macro industry-specific headwinds. In North America, we made good progress towards stabilization of the business. We learned -- we leaned into our multiple engines of growth, leveraging our successful skincare and fragrance franchises during the holiday season, in light of industry challenges in makeup. There were several bright spots. Brand representing about half of our sales grew and we had gains in the specialty-multi and online channels. In fact, La Mer delivered record Black Friday sales on its own site, driven by unique product assortment and an influencer-led holiday campaign. As we work to rejuvenate the makeup business in North America we are creating products that leverage consumer insight from our enhanced data analytics. For example, we learned consumers want product that combine skincare benefits with makeup. In response, the Este\u0301e Lauder brand just launched Futurist Hydra Rescue, a new moisturizing foundation, combining the positioning of our winning Futurist franchise in China with consumer needs in North America. The launch is off to a very strong start, with high ratings and reviews. Looking now at the channels. Our global online business delivered stellar results. Our brand sites, third-party sites and retailer sites, all grew double-digit, with broad-based strength across regions. Our online business was vibrant globally around Cyber Monday, as our brands offered well-received products and set in the important holiday gifting given season. We continue to invest in our excellent growth prospects online. We launched our brands on more third-party sites which are rising in popularity, deploy new digital payment technologies across several of our brand sites in the U.S. and expanded our loyalty programs. We reach engaged content. We have increased the time consumers spend on our brand sites and traffic has grown, increasing the inherent media value these sites provide. Travel Retail also continued its momentum. Our top eight brands grew double digits at retail, with strengths in skin care and our luxury and our artisanal fragrance brands grew strongly, aided by expanded distribution in the channel. Innovative pre-retail campaign, unique retailers' activision and effective advertising, all contributed to fantastic results. The pretail segment of Travel Retail excelled in the quarter and is becoming an increasingly important part of our business. Pretail enable us to engage with consumers before they travel, build brand equity and desirability and drive conversion. When tourism and travel resume, following containment of the coronavirus, we anticipate that pretail will continue to start. Another important highlight this quarter was the publication of our 2019 Citizenship and Sustainability Report. Last March we announced new goals and the report details our vision and progress. One of our goals is to promote ingredient transparency across our brands and Aveda led the way with an ingredient velocity on its websites. Other brands will soon follow. Innovation is the core of our company, once again helped drive our performance, accounting for over 25% of sales. We have exciting innovation from our four biggest brands coming in the second half of our fiscal year, many in their hero franchises. We believe these launches will be well received by consumers globally and these important franchises have high loyalty. We are pleased by our strong start in the first half and we are now focused on managing effectively throughout the coronavirus outbreak. We are determined to serve our consumers in the best ways possible. We believe that the efforts of the Chinese government along with leadership from around the world to contain the outbreak will prove effective. I want to thank our employees worldwide to their extraordinary efforts working through this challenging time, while supporting each other, our consumers, the communities where we work and our business. Their grace and agility are a testament to our company culture. Now, I will turn the call over to Tracey. So obviously, we don't know about the specific medical health recovery timing, which is the unknown at this point. But we are in agreement with your assumption, which is basically this will have an impact in the short term and definition of short term is what is unknown today. But then after this period, there will be a recovery and people will come gradually back to normal habits. And so, we do expect to recover our momentum at the end of the health crisis. And in terms of our assumption today are in line with what you said. We assume the two quarters to be affected by the impact and we expect a normalization in fiscal year '21. That's our assumption today. The other important thing is that, we are ready to stay close to the current mitigation of the issue and resolution of the health classes as we are doing, supporting our China team and all the activities that the government is putting in place in China today. And we also will stand ready to support the recovery when the recovery will be happening and to invest behind the recovery as required by the market opportunity, but most importantly, by the needs of rebuilding the right consumption of Chinese consumers in the name of the economical development of China. So, first of all, in -- as we said this quarter has contributed to the stabilization of our North America business and this has been in line with the strategy we communicated in Investor Day. And we remain committed and to continue the work of stabilization in the next months. So what happened this quarter is, first of all, we have used as anticipated much more granular insight in the market to activate our plans and much more local relevance in the activation. The other thing that happened, we have recognized the softness of the overall makeup market and that's why we have accelerated our activity in skin care and particularly fragrances during the holiday season that we have well fitting the situation and we got great results. So, we had -- if you want adjusted our engines of growth in a way that contributed to the good results. Our innovation pipeline as anticipated has been strong and the impact of innovation has improved. And so, all this have been a positive impact. We will continue to operate in that direction, but we do have still to be confront some of the headwinds. To be clear, the makeup softness, particularly the color makeup softness is continuing. As you mentioned, the closures of certain retailing stores where we do have high market share will continue although we completely share the Macy's strategy of focusing on the high-performance doors and/or gradually stopping the smaller and lower performance doors with -- as I said, we support the strategy, but obviously we will need to operate with the strategy with making sure that we retain the consumer -- the brands. And this will be difficult, but we will do our best to do that. So we need to take under account our extraordinary efforts to improve our model that are working, but also take under account there will continue to be headwinds. So our strategy remains at this point stabilization. That's actually a good point. We assume that there will be obviously an important reduction of Chinese travelers not visiting the U.S. in the next at least two, three months and this will have a negative impact obviously on the sales to Chinese tourists. Frankly, in this moment we are assuming in our guidance also a slowdown on any travel population. To be clear in this moment because of the coronavirus global concern, tourists in general is being reduced temporary. So, we are taking this temporary assumption -- sorry the assumption of this temporary reduction under account in our guidance. Sorry could you repeat who was the subject to the makeup when you said they? I didn't understand. I -- frankly, yes, I think everyone realizes the power of skin care in this moment and we are all working together to leverage the power of skin care also because skin care for instant results and skincare product combined with makeup is on a growth. So, there are -- yes you speak about shelf space which obviously is a bit more gradual in the way it changes. But definitely innovation programs are reflecting a lot of this. So, there is more activity, more social media, more advertising in skin care than before and this is a reflection on the results. By the way makeup is a big category. The makeup for face meaning foundation for example is still doing very, very well. The place which is softer is color. And importantly, what we are doing to contribute not only to leverage skincare fragrances better but to reinstate growth in makeup in the future is we have accelerated the innovation in the makeup category contributing to the future results of our retail partners also in this category. So, to be clear, we are not giving up at all on makeup. We are just accepting that in the short-term, we are focusing more on other category and innovating better in makeup to reactivate the consumer interest. Thank you. Okay. On the first question is -- the answer is no. At this point, we are not considering Amazon, a channel for our luxury beauty products and we are focusing of our current channels and our current partners to build a continued stabilization in North America of our business. As far as the China question, is the number of physical doors, I'll let Tracey go with that. And on the second part of the China question which is the online, absolutely the online channel is very strong in China and as we said in the second quarter. But in this moment also online is suffering because in this moment in the middle of the outbreak, the delivery system in homes and in the big distribution centers also people are now working like in this moment until February 10th, many people with non-essential activity in factories in other situation this is stopped. The same is for distribution centers the same for other activities. So online in -- at least in the short-term is having the same issues of brick-and-mortar. In terms of the role of online in the recovery in the future, we are optimistic that online will play a very strong role in the recovery when the recovery will happen. Thank you. Yeah. So the short answer to the first question in this moment travel retail is the most impacted channel. Because if you think what -- just to give you the context of what's happening, you will probably know that more than 60 airlines just closed their flights. So in this moment the travel in and out of China is suspended in the large majority of cases. So there is lack of traffic for -- just in and out of China. Second, in general tourism in this moment is more prudent, because it's a global issue. The outbreak is a global concern. And so many people which are concerned to travel in this moment are reducing their choice or postponing some of the travel. And I'm speaking touristic travel. Then there is a third factor. Many companies have banned travel to any place -- to China, but also to any other place where there is the virus. And so business travel is being reduced not to count the many companies are reducing business travel for cost containment reasons. So in this moment, the amount of travel in airports is reduced and traffic is significantly reduced. So that's the biggest impact. The second biggest impact is obviously China Mainland itself and Hong Kong, which have reduced significance. So I would say the Greater China area, because of all the reasons that we have already discussed in the prepared remarks that I'm not going to repeat. But the most important thing is that keep in mind that until February 10 most of the cities are not even -- people are not back to work until at February children are not back to school. And people are requested rightly so not to get out of home for reasons, which are not essential and not going public transportations where there is a risk of contamination. So, the behaviors of the entire population is fundamentally changed. And because of this, this is the second area where in the short-term we expect an impact. The second part of your question is the recovery. Now the recovery we know what you know. We have studied all the previous cases in all the previous situation. And what we see is that the recovery tends to be hockey sticks, meaning, when the things is back, it's back particularly in the traveling. When traffic is back, traffic is back and the people buy. The thing that can -- that we can do more in terms of the business learning that we're applying or during the period before the recovery in travel retail will be very important to push conversion, meaning, when there is -- travel retail is built by traffic and by conversion. Conversion is an area where we're making many improvements. So in this period of transition where traffic will be low, we are reworking our plans to use conversion as a key mitigating element of the deep and then obviously we are preparing for future recovery plans when the time will arrive. The last point I want to make is that we will try to tune the recovery to the recovery of the Chinese economy and the Chinese population. We don't want just to look this as a business. We want to see -- look at this as a contribution to the recovery of the country and really supporting our employees at the country in this. And the same will happen in travel retail where for example some of our customers and retail partners are Chinese. And we are going to stay close to them to contribute to the recovery of the travel retail business to make sure that our long-term retail partners will benefit from the recovery much -- as much as possible and to start this all again to restart the right process and to regain momentum not only for us, but for the entire industry. Thank you. Yes. No, that's a very good question. As I commented a lot of times on the subject this is a very important phenomenon, because today we have physical distribution in China in 123 city with our most distributed brands which are Lauder and Clinique and much lower city coverage in the other brands, which are still on a growth trajectory. So it is a lot of physical distribution potential in the long-term still untapped. But at the same time, we know there is demand in China now in over 600 cities. So there are over 450 cities where there is strong demand and there is not yet physical distribution of prestige luxury and for sure prestige luxury of Este\u0301e Lauder brands. So this demand gets filled by online and get filled by -- when there's consumer travel also travel within China like in amazing 3-Tier markets like Hainan Island then where they can access the products or when they travel for internal business or vacation like go to Beijing or to Shanghai. So that's the situation. But online cover a lot these cities and that's why also is growing and is very strategic, because it give us access to these consumers in a very productive way. The other important positive consequence of this dynamic is that the brick-and-mortar can remain very productive. It can remain very focused where there is the right productivity and online can cover productively the rest. So this is a good phenomenon continue to grow. It is definitely one of the reason behind my comment that we are having better and better results also in the Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities also where physical distribution has not yet arrived. In terms of percentage of sales, China is the highest percentage of sales online versus other markets. It's on high side and it's continued to grow. I mean, we have control of the online I mean with our partners like Tmall and obviously, our own online activity. But the \u2013 remember we \u2013 our way to build distribution and also to build coverage is \u2013 we are in luxury. And for us selective distribution, which means demand ahead of supply is very important. So we gradually build the demand. And the reason why today demand is growing so fast also in the city is social media. Because while in the past advertising was local, meaning advertising was focused in the cities where there was physical distribution. Social media by definition is national. So you are in a dynamic where demand is normally ahead of supply and that's the typical demand of the good luxury market and we are filling this demand gradually and making sure that we keep the concept of desirability and high quality and high quality also the experience that we give to our consumer in mind. So we are not selling products. We are selling quality and full experiences and we only do that when we can provide the best possible service to the consumer. So the short answer is gradually, but yes, we have the capability to dial up as the market opportunity reveals itself. So I will not give you specific numbers but I can tell you that we have the consumer data, so we know the number of consumers that are buying from different cities. Even we use these data analytics to decide where to open physical distribution. So we use the demand and the elements of the strength of the demand from the cities also to judge our physical distribution strategy to make sure that we continue to provide better high-touch services to the consumer when the demand is sufficient to be productive and to offer the quality and the service that we need to offer. So it's a gradual development of quality service. Welcome."

            "name": "Tracey Travis",
            "content": "Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning, everyone. Certainly, our thoughts and best wishes are with everyone managing through a very difficult situation in China and globally. We are committed to supporting our employees and other stakeholders, while we also manage the business impact as best we can during this time. As a reminder, my commentary today is adjusted for the items that Rainey mentioned at the beginning of the call and net sales growth numbers are in constant currency. We acquired Have & Be the owner of the Dr. Jart+ brand towards the end of December. The results for the new brand will be recorded in future periods on a one month lag, so you can expect operating results from Dr. Jart+ to be reflected in our fiscal third quarter for the first time, including the impact of purchase accounting and the interest expense on the debt we issued largely to fund this acquisition. So starting with the quarter results. Net sales for the second quarter rose 16% driven by strong growth in our international regions and improvement in North America. Sales growth in Asia, travel retail and online continue to exceed our expectations. From a geographic standpoint, our Asia Pacific region net sales rose 30% with broad-based growth across the region. Sales in Greater China accelerated, rising very strong double-digits. Our sales in Mainland China continued to deliver broad-based growth across cities, brands, categories and channels and our brands saw record results on Singles Day. As expected, sales on Hong Kong declined more than 20%. Among developed markets in APAC, we again delivered double-digit sales growth in Korea this quarter. Our sales in Japan rose mid-single digits despite the October 1st, VAT increase last year that contributed to double-digit growth last quarter. And emerging markets in Southeast Asia grew high-single-digits led by Thailand. Net sales in our Europe, the Middle East and Africa region rose 18% with most markets contributing to growth. Our global travel retail business rose strong double-digits driven largely by like-door growth the continued rapid development of online pre-ordering and the successful introduction of newer brands like Le Labo and KILIAN. Emerging markets in the region grew double-digits led by India and Russia. Western European markets grew low to mid-single digits led by Italy, Iberia and Germany. Net sales in the Americas rose 1%, a significant improvement from last quarter. Skin care and fragrance showed good growth driven by Este\u0301e Lauder, Origins and La Mer as well as strong holiday performances from Jo Malone and Tom Ford. Initial shipments of Este\u0301e Lauder's new Futurist Hydra Rescue Moisturizing Makeup launch helped to partially offset the overall continued weakness in the makeup category. In North America, sales rose high-single-digits across all our online channels. Our sales in the specialty-multi channel grew double-digits, while the brick-and-mortar department store business remained challenged. From a category standpoint, skin care once again led growth this quarter. Net sales accelerated to 28% growth with strong contributions from Este\u0301e Lauder, La Mer, Origins and Clinique. Innovations such as Este\u0301e Lauder Advanced Night Repair Intense Reset Concentrate La Mer The Regenerating Serum and Clinique iD BB-gel contributed incremental sales and supported their hero franchises. Net sales in makeup grew 7% led by Este\u0301e Lauder, Tom Ford and Bobbi Brown. Solid innovation and support in foundation and lip products, as well as special holiday sets and products drove growth in the category. Sales of fragrances grew 9% driven by strong holiday activations at Jo Malone, London and the launch of Metallique from Tom Ford. Fragrance sales grew across all regions, but were strongest in the Americas and in Asia. Our hair care sales rose 5% driven by the launch of the Nutriplenish line of products from Aveda and improvement at Bumble and bumble. Our gross margin increased 20 basis points compared to the second quarter last year. Favorable pricing and mix was partially offset by the impact of the incremental tariffs and higher obsolescence costs. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved 130 basis points. We continue to leverage higher sales and greater efficiencies in our selling model and store operating costs to fund advertising and strategic investments in technology and other capabilities. Operating income rose 23% and operating margin increased by 150 basis points. Adjusted diluted EPS of $2.11, increased 21% compared to the prior year, and the currency translation impact was negligible. EPS was higher than expected due to the stronger sales growth as well as disciplined expense management and was partially offset by a slightly higher tax rate. During the quarter, we acquired the remaining stake in Have & Be, the Korean-based skin care company. The transaction resulted in a one-time gain of $576 million, primarily related to the re-measurement of our previously held minority equity investment to fair value. We also recorded $777 million of impairment charges related to three of our four makeup brands a reflection of the continued challenges in the makeup category that have been most prevalent in North America. While the market momentum for makeup has slowed in the near term as we have previously discussed, the growth opportunities and the strategic value of these brands remains compelling as evidenced by our increased share and capability in specialty-multi retail the enhanced social media expertise of the brand and an increased consumer base of Gen-Z and millennials. Turning now to cash flow. For the six months, we generated $1.26 billion in net cash flows from operating activities, which was roughly flat with the prior year. Higher earnings were offset primarily by the timing and level of accounts payable. We invested $291 million in capital expenditures with cash and $1.04 billion to acquire the remaining equity interest in Have & Be, which was funded with debt. We also continue to return cash to stockholders by utilizing $813 million to repurchase 4.3 million shares of our stock and $330 million to pay dividends. So we ended the first six months of the fiscal year with strong net sales growth of 14% in constant currency and adjusted EPS growth of 21%, a tremendous reflection of the hard work of our teams as well as strong consumer momentum that we have in our markets. So now let's turn to our outlook for the balance of this year. The strong performance in the first half of our fiscal year, our multiple engines of growth strategy and the greater financial flexibility and agility we have built into our operating model is expected to help us to effectively manage through the short-term disruption caused by the Coronavirus outbreak. Due to the rapid escalation and the fluidity of the situation, it is both complex and difficult to predict the timing and the corresponding impact on our business. Therefore, we are not giving explicit guidance for the third quarter. We also remain mindful that a variety of macro risks such as ongoing trade tensions and continued challenges in Hong Kong's retail environment could impact our second half results. For the year -- for the fiscal year, we now strive to achieve net sales growth of at least 6% to 8% in constant currency. This range is before the impact of one point of growth from the inclusion of sales from Have & Be. Currency translation is expected to negatively affect reported sales growth by 1 percentage point reflecting weighted average rates of $1.10 for the euro, $1.27 for the pound and 7.03 for the won for the fiscal year. With this sales guidance, EPS is expected to range between $5.60 and $5.70 before restructuring and other charges. This includes approximately $0.05 of dilution from currency translation and $0.18 dilution from the Have & Be acquisition. In constant currency, we expect EPS growth of 6% to 8%. Excluding the dilution from Have & Be, EPS growth is expected to be at least 9% to 11%, which remains in line with our long-term objectives. For the second half, net sales are expected to increase approximately 1% to 2% in constant currency. Currency translation is expected to negatively impact growth by 1 percentage point and the inclusion of Have & Be is expected to add 2 percentage points. In terms of cadence throughout the second half we have anticipated the greatest negative sales impact from the Coronavirus to be in the third quarter followed by a gradual recovery in the fourth quarter. We are severely curtailing discretionary costs, while continuing to support critical areas of growth. Leading Beauty Forward has reduced our percentage of fixed cost in our operations, which gives us greater agility to manage more effectively with slowing sales. We expect the belt tightening to have the maximum benefit in the fourth quarter. EPS is forecast between $1.86 and $1.91 before restructuring charges. This includes approximately $0.03 dilution from currency and $0.17 dilution from Have & Be, which includes some impact from the Coronavirus outbreak, purchase accounting and interest expense on the debt issuance as I mentioned previously. While our outlook for the balance of this year is uncertain, we do remain quite optimistic about the long-term growth opportunities for the company. We believe we can manage through this difficult health prices while maintaining the agility to invest as needed and regain our momentum once the recovery is established. On behalf of the entire Este\u0301e Lauder Companies, we extend our deepest well wishes to those who have been affected and thank everyone for their extraordinary efforts to manage during this period particularly our incredibly hardworking and wonderful team in China. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time. And I just want to add as it relates to our guidance. I mentioned the range of $1.82 to $1.91 which is within our press release. I think I mentioned a different number in our guidance for the second half. Yes. So, starting with the Have & Be dilution, we obviously have the step-up in inventory which is one-time depends on how you're treating the interest expense which is also in that number. What I would say Michael is that we expect that Have & Be will be, if you think forward, relatively flat including purchase accounting. So, eliminating those onetime items next year and accretive the following year. The makeup question is the second question? Yes. So, as you can imagine it's quite fluid. And one of the things that we've seen is the Chinese New Year extended for many, many of our employees. Our stores have closed as malls have closed. So, very recently two-thirds of our department store doors were closed and the remaining doors were on reduced hours. Now that could change next week, so this is a very fluid situation. So I'll start and then Fabrizio can also add his comments. We are progressing towards stabilization in North America. And clearly, it was a strong holiday and strong second quarter for us in North America and in other parts of the globe. So our teams have worked awfully hard to make this holiday season a very good one and consumers responded and we're very happy about that. As we look at the back half of the year, Fabrizio touched on the fact that we do have tourists that we expect that that business to be a bit softer given the situation that we're managing through globally. And I would also say that North America is making progressive progress. However, I would not expect that the second quarter would necessarily be reflective of continued acceleration from there. But the North America team is executing against all of the strategies that were laid out last year and we're seeing some good outcomes from that. So what we told you last quarter was North America, we expect certainly to have better performance this year than we did last year in North America. So that is progression towards stabilization. Lauren asked earlier about the Macy's announcement. And clearly, as we've been saying for some time, we believe that brick-and-mortar needs to be taken out of North America. North America has been over retailed for some time. So we are very much aligned with what Macy's has announced in their Investor Day yesterday. The doors that actually would be closing in our fiscal year were already included in our guidance."

For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Rainey Mancini.\nRainey Mancini: Good morning. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and other reports filed with the SEC, where you will find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges and adjustments disclosed in our press release. All net sales growth numbers are in constant currency. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investors section of our website. During the Q&A session, we will ask that you please limit to one question, so we can respond to all of you within the time scheduled for this call. And now I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio.\nFabrizio Freda: Thank you, Rainey, and good morning, everyone. We have started off our new fiscal year with terrific results. Our successful strategy driven by the multiple engines of growth helped us to deliver an extraordinary performance, especially in light of the volatile macro environment. Net sales grew 12% in constant currency making our tenth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. As a result, we gained share and strengthened our leading position in global prestige beauty. We leveraged our strong sales increase with a disciplined focus on cost and adjusted diluted earnings per share rose 20%. Our performance on both the top and the bottom lines was fueled by successful innovations, increased advertising and effective marketing across brands, categories, geographies and channels. With deeper consumer insights informed by improved data analytics, we expanded our growth engines activated additional ones and invested in the best opportunities worldwide, which fueled these strong results. We remain mindful of global volatility risk. However, with the strong start and our confidence in continue to execute effectively, we are raising our net sales and EPS estimates for the year in constant currency. During the quarter, the external environment was challenging and we faced different issues in every region. Disruptions in Hong Kong affected commerce in that area. Continued uncertainty about Brexit impacted consumer spending in the UK and demand for makeup in North America softened. However, by having numerous growth engines across all facets of our business, we were able to deliver and exceed our sales and earnings expectations. Most of the over-achievement came from continued strengths in China and Travel Retail. We also had better-than-expected improvements across Europe and our other emerging markets. Also, contributed to our continued growth is our company positions in the sweet spot of consumer goods. Our brands generate superior consumer loyalty, evident in our strong repurchase rates. And while our high quality products justify premium pricing, they are an affordable luxury, which we believe, makes them more resilient to economic volatility than other luxury products. During the quarter, each of our four largest brands grew globally, reflecting strong consumer demand for established brands and their proven desirable product and compelling innovations. Estee Lauder and La Mer each advanced more than 20%. A key strategy is our focus on hero franchises which are the high repeat products in each brand. With greater innovation and resources around these hero product lines; our brands successfully attracted new consumers and reinforced their loyalty with existing ones. Our Estee Lauder brand is a great example of this winning strategy. The brand introduced a new product in its largest franchise Advanced Night Repair. Sales of the concentrate exceeded our expectations, and it helped lift the entire franchise by double-digits globally. In Asia, buzz around Estee Lauder new Intense Reset Concentrate broadened the brand reach about 70% of consumers who bought it were new to the brand, underscoring our strategic priority to attract new users with exciting innovations. Estee Lauder was one of several of our brands that benefited from rapid growth in the skincare category worldwide. We are well-positioned to meet the growing demand for all types of skincare products. It is our largest category and grew sharply accounting for nearly half of our global sales in the quarter. We continue to invest in skincare. La Mer gained share in luxury skin care in Asia Pacific and Clinique delivered a stronger global growth in several years driven by well received skin care innovations. One of Clinique's newest products, the Smart Clinical multidimensional moisturizer line resonated strongly with ageless consumers, particularly in North America and the UK. In other developments, our Tom Ford Beauty brand launched a luxury skincare collection to complement its successful fragrance and makeup offerings. Our makeup sales grew globally driven by a sharp uptick in Asia Pacific and Travel Retail as well as gains in the European region. The deceleration in prestige color cosmetics has been driven by Anglo market, but growth is still healthy in other geographies. And global companies like ours are well-positioned to grow in the category. Using enhanced data analytics and consumer insight that signal new and fast growing areas of demand, we invest in the promising subcategories as they emerge. For example, we knew the interest in foundations with skincare benefits was trending. With that insight, we develop new products around our hero foundations they offer hydrating and smoothing benefits. In our foundation business climbed 20% globally. We innovated with great success in other subcategories where we found granular opportunities. For example, MAC introduced Love Me lipstick, a breakthrough weightless and motorizing formula that offers lasting color. The product helped increase the brand lip business which climbed double-digits. Overall, our innovation was robust and new products accounting for 30% of our makeup category this quarter. Turning to our geographies. Our growth in China accelerated from the previous quarter, fueled by multiple engines. We had double-digit growth across all categories, all channels and nearly all brands. Our online business in China was strong. Our sales on Tmall doubled with growth across brands. We also successfully partnered with Tmall on special events, such as Jo Malone London Super Brand Day. Additionally, GLAMGLOW launched on the platform in September. Investing in emerging markets remains a strategic priority because we anticipate a continuation of growing demand for prestige beauty from the expanding middle class. Excluding China, as a group, this market rose double digits and they recruited several new consumers. Standout included Russia, Mexico, Brazil and Southeast Asia and we saw improvements in retail in Middle East. Our business in Hong Kong was challenged. Our sales declined 20% in the quarter and we have not seen sign of improvement to-date. However, since the last downturn in the market, we have re-positioned our business and increased sales with local consumers becoming less dependent on tourists, which was the most affected area. Our sales decline in Hong Kong was offset by an acceleration in the rest of Asia, reflecting strong consumer demand for our prestige brands and desirable products. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, every market grew, which added another growth driver and broadened our multiple engines. We were encouraged by strengths in the large Western European markets which advanced as well as many emerging markets in the region. Thanks in part to strong reception of our brand's innovation across categories. The North America market remained challenged by declining makeup sales, mainly in color cosmetics, as well as weak traffic in brick and mortar department store where we are the largest player. Although, our business generally reflected these trends, there were several bright spots. Our skincare business rose, several brands had higher sales and we had grown in key subcategories such as eye treatments or mascara. Typically, skincare makeup growth fluctuates depending on trends and innovation and can accelerate at different rates at different times. However, on average, over the last five years, both categories rose nearly 10% compounded annually in the US. We believe recent declines in color cosmetics in the US are due to several factors. Trends change and a more natural appearance is now involved, which requires fewer products that went contouring and other looks were popular. Also, the number of new product launches in makeup declined 20% in the last year, including forming the brands. In addition, Gen Z consumers are discovering the benefits of skin care, spurred by more social media activity in that category. Our brands continue to innovate strongly in both makeup and skincare. Clinique recently launched a new lipstick collection, which matches the consumer foundation shape with 28 new lipstick color based on the brand shade Match Science. This continues Clinique customization of beauty product that began with its successful Clinique at the skincare launch. Looking at our business by channel. Travel Retail and online globally again drove our performance. Travel Retail upward trajectory continued with strong double-digit sales growth, reflecting diversified growth engines across brands worldwide. Our products continue to resonate globally and like-door growth was robust. Among our top eight brands in the channel, all but one grew double-digits at retail. Digital campaigns and pre-ordering aimed at travelers before they start their trip helped boost sales. We expanded distribution for our newer artisanal fragrance brands and there is still much distribution expansion remaining for many brands in our portfolio that are only available in a small percentage of airports. Our online business also climbed strong double-digits. All types of online distribution grew substantially led by third-party sites and retailer sites. Traffic was higher and mobile commerce accounted for more than half of our e-commerce sales. We increased our advertising investment faster than our sales growth and continued to focus our spending on digital advertising, which accounted for 75% of the total. Our digital spending is mainly on advertising social media communications and search engines. Our brands are using many digital tools and experimenting with emerging social media platform to connect with consumers. For example, MAC launched a tool that lets consumer test over 100 lipstick shades on their own face by accessing the camera of their own phone and to simply research and purchasing. La Mer and Bobbi Brown launched voice search on their brand dot com sites in North America. We are proud of our results this quarter and confident we have the right plans in place for the rest of the year. Our brands have created many exciting products and promotions for the holiday period, in store and online for Cyber Monday and 11/11 in Asia and we believe consumers will be attracted by our compelling offerings. Looking ahead, we expect to further expand and magnify our multiple engine of growth across categories, brands, channels and geographies to better manage global volatility. We will continue to leverage our superb skincare growth and expect to gain even greater market share in that category. We have the best diversified pure-play in global prestige beauty with talented global teams and have profound local expertise, which makes us well positioned to pursue the fastest-growing areas around the world for any kind of consumer. At the same time, we will continue to transform our business as we anticipate what lies ahead and strengthen our entrepreneurial and competitive spirits. Now, I will turn the call over to Tracey.\nTracey Travis: Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning everyone. As a reminder, my commentary today is adjusted for the items that Rainey mentioned at the beginning of the call and net sales growth numbers are in constant currency. And now for the quarter results. Net sales for the first quarter rose 12% driven by strong growth in our international regions and in our skincare category. Asia, Travel Retail and online continued to deliver strong growth and our European and Latin America market sales growth accelerated, while sales in North America remain challenged. From a geographic standpoint, our Asia Pacific region net sales rose 26%, with more than half of the markets contributing double-digit increases. Sales in Greater China rose strong double-digits. Our sales in Mainland China continued to deliver broad-based growth across cities, brands, categories and channels as we gained share and as anticipated, our sales in Hong Kong fell 20%. Among developed markets in APAC, both Japan and Korea delivered double-digit sales growth this quarter. Our sales in Japan which grew a solid 7% last fiscal year, accelerated even further within the quarter in anticipation of an October 1st VAT increase the country. In Korea, sales in specialty-multi and online distribution were robust. And we gained share in department stores. Southeast Asia grew double-digits led by Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam. Net sales in our Europe, the Middle East and Africa region rose 19%, with every market contributing to growth. Our Global Travel retail business rose strong double-digits led by quarters across Asia. Strong like-door growth drove the majority of the increase in Travel Retail, and was supplemented by the rapid development of online pre-ordering. Our emerging markets in the region grew high-single digits, led by a double-digit increase in Russia and the Middle East. Western markets grew mid-single digits, led by Switzerland and Greece. Our sales in the UK grew modestly this quarter despite continued challenges in brick and mortar retail. Some retailers bought extra stock this quarter ahead of the anticipated hard Brexit and our online business in the UK continued to grow double-digits. Net sales in the Americas, declined 6%. Brick and mortar retail remained difficult especially in department stores. As you know, the makeup category in North America has been declining and we are the leading prestige company in the category. We continue to invest where we saw the best opportunities for growth. Skincare showed good growth driven by Estee Lauder, Clinique and La Mer, in their hero franchises. Within makeup, we saw solid growth with some key subcategories such as mascara. And while our fragrance business was particularly soft this quarter, it is expected to pick up in the holiday quarter. Looking at the region by channel, North America sales rose in both brand and retailer online as well as in freestanding retail stores. Our sales in the specialty-multi channel also grew at retail. Our Estee Lauder brand and most luxury brands grew in North America this quarter. In addition, sales in Latin America grew double-digits in all major markets. From a category standpoint, skincare led growth this quarter. Net sales accelerated to 25% with strong contributions from Estee Lauder, La Mer and Clinique. Innovations such as Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair Intense, Reset Concentrate, LA Mer the Regenerating Serum and Clinique's Smart-Clinical multi-dimensional line, contributed incremental sales and supported hero franchises. And the historical strength of Origins and natural skincare helped drive the brand's double-digit gains. Net sales in makeup grew 4%, with strong double-digit growth in Asia and Travel Retail led by strong innovations and support behind foundation and lip products from Estee Lauder, MAC, Lamar and Tom Ford Beauty. Sales of fragrances declined 1% as sales in luxury and artisanal brands were offset by declines in designer fragrances. Clinique and Estee Lauder which had a tough comparison to the prior year launch of Beautiful Belle. Innovations this quarter included Poppy & Barley from Jo Malone, METALLIQUE from Tom Ford and new City Exclusives from Le Labo. Fragrance sales grew in all international regions, but were soft in the Americas region as I mentioned earlier. Our hair care sales declined 4% driven by a tough comparison to the prior year launch of Cherry Almond shampoo and conditioner from Aveda, as well as lower sales from Bumble and bumble in North America. Our gross margin declined 10 basis points compared to the first quarter last year. Higher obsolescence and sourcing costs were mostly offset by pricing and favorable skincare category mix. Operating expenses as a percent of sales improved 120 basis points. Continued leverage of our cost base due to greater efficiencies in our selling model and store operating costs more than covered higher advertising investments to build awareness in critical growth markets and support our innovations globally. Operating income rose 17% and operating margin increased by 110 basis points. Diluted EPS of $1.67 increased 19% compared to the prior year and grew 20% in constant currency. EPS was higher than expected due to the stronger sales growth with greater operating leverage and a slightly favorable tax rate. During the quarter, we utilized $170 million in net cash flows from operating activities, which was below the prior year, due primarily to timing differences in accounts payable and we invested $125 million in capital expenditures. We used $313 million to repurchase 1.6 million shares of our stock and paid $156 million in dividends. We also announced this morning a 12% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.48 per share. Now, let's turn to our outlook for next quarter and for the full year. We are pleased obviously with the strong start to our fiscal year, but we recognize that a variety of macro risks such as ongoing trade tensions, Brexit and continued challenges in Hong Kong's retail environment could impact our fiscal 2020 results. Nonetheless, we believe our multiple engines of growth strategy will continue to deliver strong global results. For the year, we are raising our sales growth expectation by one point to 8% to 9% in constant currency. This still assumes a moderation of growth in China in Travel Retail in the back half of the year. Despite the market conditions in place today, we expect our North America business to gradually improve fueled by innovations in skincare and foundations, better fragrance performance during holiday and strong growth online. Currency translation is expected to negatively affect reported sales growth by 1 percentage point, reflecting weighted average rates of $1.09 for the euro, $1.23 for the pound and $7.12 for the won for the fiscal year. EPS is expected to range between $5.85 and $5.93 before restructuring and other charges. This includes approximately $0.05 of dilution from currency translation. As you are most likely aware, currency rates have moved about 3% to 4% since our last guidance, which was based on rates as of June 30th, the spot rate. The won, euro and pound have all weakened relative to the US dollar and created a currency swing of approximately $0.10 on our annual expectations for EPS. So the currency impact previously was a plus $0.05 that we were expecting for the year and we are now expecting a minus $0.05 EPS impact based on the September 30th spot rates. For the second quarter, net sales are expected to increase approximately 8% to 9% in constant currency. Currency translation is expected to negatively impact growth by 1 percentage point. Therefore we expect reported net sales to grow between 7% and 8%. EPS is forecast between $1.83 and $1.86 before restructuring charges. This includes about $0.02 dilution from currency. With a strong start to the fiscal year, we are optimistic about our ability to execute our plans to deliver another year of top line growth, margin expansion and double-digit EPS improvement. And with that, that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time.\nOperator: The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks so much. I wanted to ask a little bit about US and distribution footprint because the commentary we all know of course that the specialty-multi channel has slowed a bit. And Tracey, your comment I think was pretty specific that you still saw growth in the channel at retail. So I guess one, can you talk about any inventory destocking that might be going on in that channel? And two, what might be happening there in terms of foot traffic and takeaway because that might tell a slightly better story in terms of the health of the channel versus, I think what we're all worried about in terms of maybe like a structural slowdown of the channel? Thanks.\nFabrizio Freda: Let me start answering this question. I think the key point is I don't think stocks -- the key point here is that the color makeup market has softened. And there are certain companies like us and certain retailers which are more exposed to makeup than others. And this has fluctuations. And so in that quarter, that was the new news that we have managed around. And so the key idea is that when we see trends, we are able to anticipate and react to those trends. That's why we moderated the impact of this fluctuation on makeup, pushing more obviously our skincare business and continue building our distribution in the way that we want to focus it in the long term, meaning swinging the distribution toward high traffic, high performance channels and retailers gradually over time. So, the strategy continues. On top in North America, we have really improved our team, our capabilities, our ability to manage the market granularly exactly to anticipate and react to these trends very fast. We have better consumer insights; more local relevance and we have dramatically improved the ability to work online and our online business have been very solid. So, we are committed to improve the North America trends in the course of this fiscal year obviously even more in the long term. And this quarter was mainly, as I explained, a softer than expected color makeup business.\nLauren Lieberman: Okay, that's great. Thank you. In that regard Fabrizio you're pointing out some of the changes that you've already started to make in the US and that you had actually talked about and I think some of the things that Chris Good highlighted at your Analyst Day in the spring were really interesting, so it was a type of [ph] segmentation. So when do we start to see or do you think we start to see that impact performance? Is that kind of why you're speaking to the forecasted improvement from here? It's less about the makeup category and getting healthier and more about some of Estee Lauder specific proactive hyper-segmentation coming into play? Is that fair?\nFabrizio Freda: Yes, that's fair. It is going to be more proactive segmentation. Also it's going to be innovation focused on this proactive segmentation. That's why in my prepared remark I explained that our innovation, for example, the Clinique innovation on makeup is more customized exactly to the opportunity we had identified. I also explained that frankly, when you don't look to the last quarter or the last six months, but you look to the last five years, the categories, makeup, skin care or even the subcategories like color cosmetic versus the foundation or moisturizer versus anti-aging had different situation and different trends. On average over the years, this category all been growing pretty well. In this moment, there is a softness in color makeup for a specific consumer-driven reason. I personally believe this will come back. It has always come back up and down over time.\nTracey Travis: I would also add more in that. We did have an unusual anniversarying of a very strong launch period last quarter from a fragrance standpoint last year with Estee Lauder Beautiful Belle and some of our other designer fragrances, and we are comfortable and quite encouraged by our holiday programs for the second quarter.\nFabrizio Freda: Yes. And also, I want to clarify because maybe this is not completely coming out from the fragrance number that our high-end fragrances so Jo Malone, Tom Ford continues to grow very strongly also in North America -- globally and in North America. So the fragrance number is 100% influenced by the base period of the launch of Estee Lauder in the past and scent designer fragrance performance, but our high-end fragrances continue to be strong performance, continue to become a bigger percentage of our business and we are at the moment of tilting the proportion.\nLauren Lieberman: Okay, great. Thank you so much. I'll pass it on and try to get back in.\nOperator: The next question is from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey, good morning. So I wanted to flush out a bit more the lower global prestige beauty category revenue growth guidance you gave in your release versus last quarter. Can you give us a sense of which geographies and product categories are driving that lower growth expectation? Is it just mainly US makeup or are there other areas and then obviously you raised your own internal sales forecasts? So just help us understand the context of greater confidence in Estee market share trends within that lower prestige category growth?\nFabrizio Freda: Yes. First of all, I want to say our estimate of the market is still very, very strong and the 5% to 6% is at the top of the historical averages. So to be clear, we continue to believe that this -- the prestige beauty is going to be one of the fastest growing market in consumer goods and that will continue to be in this moment on top of the historical averages. So, this is a great moment of growth overall. We have taken this point down in reflecting the reality of the softening of the color makeup, particularly in the Anglo market, specifically North America, UK, Australia and to reflect our assumption to a moderation of growth, in China and Travel Retail that however, to be clear, we have not yet seen happening, but just to be consistent with our future forecast and that's what we're seeing, but again, this is the most robust consumer market in the numbers and this robustness will continue in our estimate.\nTracey Travis: And obviously taking up the year certainly reflects there the performance that we saw in the first quarter.\nDara Mohsenian: Great, thanks.\nOperator: The next question is from Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nOlivia Tong: Great, thanks. Just sort of following up a little bit on that. Can you talk about your expectation for market share gains, particularly given that a key competitor's luxury division at least this quarter outpaced your growth? Now clearly Asia continues to be fantastic. Is there more coming there to drive even greater improvement, more in terms of the US rebound? You talked a little bit about that in the prepared remarks, even more doors, even better innovation? And maybe if you could just sort of, if possible, on the category growth, just sort of talk through the prestige growth where it's more --where your expectation is going in makeup? Thanks.\nTracey Travis: So I'll start and then Fabrizio will continue. So, Olivia, we're seeing strong growth in Asia. We're seeing very strong growth, as we've called out previously in Travel Retail. We're seeing also an acceleration in EMEA as well. So some of the things that give us confidence in terms of gaining market share, it's less about North America at the moment, although we clearly expect to see, as I said in my prepared remarks, modest improvements in North America throughout the course of the year, but from a share standpoint, we really expect to gain share outside of North America in our international markets as well as good growth in online as well.\nFabrizio Freda: Yes. And on top of what Tracey explained, obviously is the strength of this quarter -- the strengths of the last two years show that we are growing clearly ahead of market. So we are gaining market share. So it's not that we plan to do anything different. We continue to gain market share in a very good way, we are growing market share today. Our strategy for growing market share is not to spend aggressively in stable markets to fight market share in a zero-sum gain. Our strategy to grow market share is dictated by our Compass, where we anticipate where growth will come from and we build market share at the beginning of the growth trend. For example, in this moment, we are gaining significant market share in China. We are gaining significant market share in every single of the emerging markets of the world. We are gaining, again, market share in Europe, in Western Europe. We are gaining market share in most of the categories in the UK because of the softness on the market. And so we grow market share where we are taking the opportunity to really anticipate growth in areas that then in the future will increase dramatically so that our market share is also a reflection of mix where our high market share markets will become over time bigger and grow our global market share. So it's a very long-term-oriented game. And because of this, it's very efficient and our rate of return on the investment of our market share growth are excellent and I monitor it every day. The other big driver of market share growth is innovation. As we said, we had a robust innovation, a very, very good results in the success of our innovation. In the last years, we have improved it dramatically. Our speed of our innovation is improving; in this moment, we had about 70% of the innovation that we had developed from idea to market in 12 months and many other particularly makeup within six months. This was not possible in the past and this has reinforced our ability to grow market share via innovation in every market of the world. And then finally, our Leading Beauty Forward activities have created more flexibility for us to invest in advertising and advertising invested in the current way is the other increasing tool and increasing strength for us to grow market share globally.\nOperator: The next question is from Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nAli Dibadj: Thanks. Fabrizio, that's a very good segue to my question actually and recognizing very much the share gains that you've developed and growing the beauty category even as it slows the gap in fact as to your point continue to expand as you continue to outgrow even further the category. And I guess my question is what levers do you have at your disposal if the top line of the category slows even more. What levers do you have at your disposal to keep growing top line, keep growing margins if it really gets tougher from here, would you just continue to invest more in advertising and innovation like you just described, would you acquire more, would you lever the balance sheet more and buy back stock more? Are there new expansion and geographies that you take advantage of? Could you cut costs a lot further? I guess I'm trying to get a better sense of what's the contingency plan if the world gets much tougher from here?\nFabrizio Freda: The contingency plan is the diversification of our business in the sense that we believe that the total beauty business globally will continue to grow healthy, as I just explained in the previous question. So we can argue, if this 5% to 6% or 6% to 7%, but those are the recent numbers. And this is sustainable in the long term as we have explained in our Analyst Day. So that being the base, however as we have demonstrated in this moment, that could be in a given market, a given category which is softer in this moment is color makeup in the United States as an example. And then what we do is that we are able to continue to try to improve in this category and using the softness also to build some market share. But most importantly, we are going to diversify our investment, our innovation, our marketing activation, our consumer repeat purchase activations and CRMs on where there is growth. And today we have the agility to move investment from maybe temporarily soft markets or categories to very, very high growth market and categories. This agility has improved, thanks to the increase of variable cost and reduction of fixed costs that Leading Beauty Forward provide and our flexibility to invest in advertising when needed. So, basically the answer -- the overall strategic answer to your question, the flexibility that we have is part of our multiple engine or growth strategy and the ability to continuously invest on where there is growth, where the return of our investment will be the highest not only financially, but also in term of growth in market share. Then going more in specific of the flexibility, we have taken this quarter -- I think this quarter, you can read it in many different ways, but for us it's a terrific demonstration of our multiple engine of growth. We are delivering a 12% growth globally and despite color makeup had one of the softer trends in Anglo markets in the last years, Hong Kong has been difficult, and North America business in total had a softer market than expected. Why? Because we have accelerated angry [ph] market share and deployed innovation in skincare in a terrific way across the globe in every single market because this quarter, 94% of our brands grew, basically all our portfolio is growing because Asia has further accelerated. China has further accelerated. TR has been super strong. Online continue to grow at the same strong level that's been growing for some years. In every single online channel, one data point which is interesting, our direct-to-consumer part of online, meaning where we have direct-to-consumer which include our brand dot com and Tmall, has been growing at 40%-plus. So we continue achieving more direct content with the consumers via that. And we have been able, despite this area of softness, to focus also on the area of strengths, adding total to beat our growth forecast. That I think is the key sign that we are trying to explain is the secret is not never having something in the world that doesn't work. With such a big category, something will go wrong somewhere, but now we have the flexibility to move in order to always try our best to deliver the total and progress the total in term of growth, EPS and market share.\nOperator: The next question is from Rob Ottenstein with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nRobert Ottenstein: Great, thank you very much. I'd like to drill down a little bit more into China and specifically a number of things. First, you noted that China had accelerated. Was that your business and your market share or was it the market as a whole? Second, as you've looked at and related -- as you've looked at the Chinese market over the last 12 months, have there been any changes that you've seen or any adjustments that you've done to give us a little bit better sense of what's going on in the ground? And then finally, our read of the media that's coming out of China, is that the pre-sales for 11/11 are off to a record start. I mean, really phenomenal pre-sales. Is that correct and has that continued? Thank you.\nFabrizio Freda: So let's start to the core of your question. China market continued to grow, the beauty market above 20%. So the market is super solid. We grew much more than that and we built significant market share. In the quarter, we built almost 2 full points of market share, so significant market share in the market. And so both the market and our market share gains are working together in that sense. What is driving that? First of all, we are in China for the long term. We have a local organization which is terrific and understand the local relevance of the market. We are able to invest in all the area of growth. In this moment in China, there is a lot of growth that is coming also not only for Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities, which has been true for some time, but Tier 3 sorry and Tier 4 city are accelerating significantly, which is what is reflected in the acceleration of Tmall that you are referring to. Let me explain what the dynamic here. Historically in China, there was no national advertising. We could invest where we had distribution. So if you had stores in Shanghai, you could invest in print in Shanghai. With the advent of social media, social media is national. And because of this, there is the possibility of creating demand nationally even if distribution for the moment is -- our most distributed brand is in totally 121 cities, while in reality, there is social media impact and demand created in over 600 cities. So there are hundreds of cities with million inhabitants with growing middle class that for the moment do not have access to physical distribution. And obviously, the two drivers of their consumption is TR and Tmall and online brand.com site like ours. So obviously, over time, distribution will increase and physical distribution will make more inroads into these cities. But for the time being, online is basically the way in which demand gets satisfied. And with that dynamic is a long-term dynamic and will continue for some time independently from temporary or not softness or economic variations. But this long-term is driven by middle class demographics and by the passion for beauty of the Chinese population, and frankly, for the Asian population as a whole. So this is the trend and I believe that our position is strong and the forecast for the market in the long term remains as strong as possible.\nOperator: The next question is from Wendy Nicholson with Citi. Please go ahead.\nWendy Nicholson: Hi, two questions if I can. First, on the balance sheet. Your cash balance just continues to grow on -- and I assume you're in the market or will be soon supporting the stock and buying back more. But just generally, you're kind of -- it seems like you're sort of -- there's an aversion to acquisitions these days. But can you talk about, sort of, your interest in doing something more aggressive on the repurchase side? What's your philosophy with that growing cash balance? And then just secondly, can you remind us -- the gross margin has been under pressure now for several years and it just continues to surprise me because skincare I thought was your highest gross margin business. And with that outsized growth, I would have thought gross margin would revert to going back up at some point. So that -- a little bit of color there would be great too. Thanks.\nTracey Travis: Okay. So let me start with your second question, Wendy. In terms of the gross margin, there are many factors that impact gross margin, obviously. And clearly, skincare is a benefit from a gross margin standpoint. Certain channels are a benefit from a gross margin standpoint as well. As we've called out, we have given where growth is coming from for us, a lot in Asian markets and you're aware of our footprint. We do have more supply chain expenses related to supporting some of the terrific double-digit growth that we've had and certainly that growth being in the Eastern part of the world has increased both inventory levels as well as transit costs. The tariffs, we've also spoken about the fact that we do have and have included some of the higher tariffs that have been called out in our gross margin as well. So we are seeing some shifts upside related to category mix and some geographic mix, offset by some of those other factors related to freight as well as obsolescence and some of the supply chain costs related to tariffs, etcetera. In terms of the balance sheet, our general philosophy as it relates to free cash flow is to return free cash flow to shareholders if in fact, we don't have any acquisitions that we are contemplating. We are always in the market looking for the right strategic acquisitions that will represent white space opportunity for us and incremental sales and profit growth. We also have minority investments that we have a path to purchase as well. So, we definitely consider acquisitions as an important strategic growth opportunity for us, the right acquisitions that again represent a good fit within our portfolio. If we have no acquisitions that are at the right price and represent those white space opportunities, then generally -- and we have this discussion every year with our board, we return 100% of free cash flow to shareholders via dividends and share repurchase activity. And you're aware as well, we have also increased our CapEx this year to reinvest back in the business again to support long-term growth. So I think our capital deployment in terms of the cash, even though you're seeing a little bit extra on the balance sheet is, in the highest return areas in terms of how we strategically allocate it for our purposes as well as for shareholder purposes.\nOperator: The next question is from Mark [ph] with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks and good morning, everybody. A couple of clarifications, please. So the VAT benefit in Japan, how much was the benefit, was it material in the quarter, is there any expectations that that comes out of the December quarter? And then your category growth expectation, I was under the impression that you had anticipated a moderation at some point in time in China when you gave it originally. And so your comment in addition to North America weakness was I guess somewhat surprising or maybe I misinterpreted it. So, maybe if you could talk about kind of the confluence of those expecting China to already decelerate and yet taking your global growth rate down. And kind of related to the last one, how do you think about North America over the balance of the year? You had talked about it, anticipated to stabilize; is that still the expectation and what does stabilize kind of mean?\nTracey Travis: Okay, let me start. I'll start with your question on Japan. So as I'm sure you're aware, the Japan market had a VAT increase starting on October 1st. So typically -- and we have this experience from the last time, there was a VAT increase in the market. We do see some acceleration of purchases into the month prior to the increase, which is expected. It typically normalizes out during the course of the year. So the reason I commented on the fact that we're coming off of a 7% growth last year from Japan, we certainly expect Japan for the year will normalize out to the levels of very strong growth that we've seen and we're very pleased with the pickup that we've seen in Japan over the last couple of years, really a testament to the great team that we have in Japan and what they've been doing in the market. As it relates to North America, we did say and I did say in my prepared remarks, we expect gradual improvement. We did talk about the fact that we have seen further deceleration in North America. Fabrizio talked about the color makeup challenges that we, along with others, have spoken about in the market. So depending on your definition of stabilization, we certainly expect to see improvement from the results that we saw in the first quarter. And again, we had some unusual anniversarying items in the first quarter as well, but -- so we expect to see gradual improvement from the first quarter results throughout the balance of the year for North America.\nFabrizio Freda: And I think the other part you referred to China. We said, no, our market point of view is that 5% to 6% growth is a super strong growth that will continue at the high end as explained of the historical range, but we have reflected the softening of the makeup North America market in our global estimate. And then we continue to assume that there could be a softening of the China market in the future, but as I said, we have not seen it yet. I just commented that actually we see an acceleration in this moment, but we believe this is a prudent assumption in the current global economic situation.\nOperator: The next question is from Fulvio [ph] with Berenberg. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yes. Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Just on that last comment you made Fabrizio about the potential of a slowdown in China. I mean given the comments that you've also made during this call about the contingencies, the diversification of your business, the ability to quickly react and adapt and go after new pockets of growth. How should we then read that in reference to the guidance that you've given? Because I guess if you think about what you've delivered, what you expect to deliver in the second quarter, your full year guidance implies just over 5% organic growth in the second half. I'm just sort of trying to understand why you couldn't use all the tools that you've got available now to offset potentially some of that China slowdown if and when it comes in the second half to still generate a high level of growth? Thank you.\nTracey Travis: So, I think -- this is Tracey and then Fabrizio will respond. In the second half, we're -- I think your numbers are a little soft. If you do the math, it's more in the 6% to 7% range in terms of what we're expecting in the second half of the year with the moderation that we spoke about in -- as it relates to China and Travel Retail. And again, given the global backdrop and the global environment, it has nothing to do with our business. It is really a point of view with respect to what could happen to global markets given the fact that there are global macro slowdowns, even though we haven't in fact seen it in China and haven't seen it affect our Asia business in general, which is quite strong, but it certainly could happen. And so as we plan our business, plan our resources in the second half of the year, clearly if it doesn't happen, then we'll continue to have the kind of results that we had in the first quarter, but we think it's responsible for us to expect what many economists are projecting in terms of a slowdown in the second half of the year.\nFabrizio Freda: Yes. And by the way, to go to your point, I've explained all our great strengths, strategic strengths, the flexibility, the agility, the ability to leverage all channel. That's why we believe that even if there was a slowdown, we will continue to build market share and we'll continue to be ahead of the market. That's the strengths we've built. And if there will be no slowdown, we will over-deliver and that's what happened this quarter. And it happened frankly even in case there was one element, that actually was worse than our expectation. There was the makeup color market in the US. So even in presence of one element, that was actually a surprise, we still over-deliver because all the other elements, first of all, the strategic execution that I commented on and second, the overall trend of the market in Asia is now slowdown and our strategy execution is excellent and so we have over-delivered. And that's the situation. In this moment, as you see also, currencies have impacted in a way which were different than our guidance just few months ago. So there're many variables that we are trying to take under account, but the strengths of our model and the ability to navigate good times and bad times, growing market share, doing better than market that I believe is by now really proven.\nTracey Travis: Thank you for recognizing the fact that we are operating quite well in a very difficult market.\nFabrizio Freda: Yes.\nRainey Mancini: We do have time for one final question, that question will come from Linda Bolton with D. A. Davidson. Please go ahead.\nLinda Bolton: So I was wondering if you could comment on this concept of your hero products, which drive your core franchises so successfully. I think in the past, you had commented that some of the indie brands in North America may be weren't so good at that. Have you detected any increased capability on their part to develop these hero products, which could be further threatening to your market share? Can you just comment on that? And also the idea that your costs to attract attention on first trial is rising over time, can you comment on that trend and whether there's been any change there? Thanks.\nFabrizio Freda: Yes, interesting question. So as I explained also in my prepared remark, what we define hero products in our portfolio is actually products with high repeat rates and a decent purchase frequency, meaning products that have not only the power to make the consumer loyal, but also they have to bring the consumer to the repurchase return that create traffic in stores for our partners and for ourselves. So these products are very precious in the portfolio and to build product like that, marketing is not enough. You need superior quality and great performance because I know many people, including myself, that is tempted to try new stuff one time to try new things, but I don't know any person that buys these things the second time if this product didn't perform in line with expectation and that's what we mean. We invest into high quality R&D, high quality manufacturing, safety, clinical test, product that really work and not only they work in term of performance and they have the kind of texture and usage experience that made the consumer delighted about what design and that investments that at the end is the essence of our premium pricing strategy. That investment creates repeat purchase. This is still a very big differentiator between on average our portfolio and the portfolio of indie brands. If you look at the numbers, the difference in repeat are still significant because also the difference of repeat are driven by quality, innovation and by the ability to delight the consumer over the long term. So we believe this is a strength which is not being mitigated. In your question, you speak about new threat. Frankly, on that topic, I don't see new threat. Actually, I see new strengths and it is from new strengths for our brands, not for the indie brands. And to prove that, is that this is the first quarter in some time where each one of our big brands is growing globally and the total of them is growing faster than any combination of our indie brands; and so it is really an extraordinary, if you want proof of the point, that repeat purchase is the biggest driver of prestige beauty.\nOperator: That concludes today's question and answer session.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Fabrizio Freda",
            "content": "Thank you, Rainey, and good morning, everyone. We have started off our new fiscal year with terrific results. Our successful strategy driven by the multiple engines of growth helped us to deliver an extraordinary performance, especially in light of the volatile macro environment. Net sales grew 12% in constant currency making our tenth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. As a result, we gained share and strengthened our leading position in global prestige beauty. We leveraged our strong sales increase with a disciplined focus on cost and adjusted diluted earnings per share rose 20%. Our performance on both the top and the bottom lines was fueled by successful innovations, increased advertising and effective marketing across brands, categories, geographies and channels. With deeper consumer insights informed by improved data analytics, we expanded our growth engines activated additional ones and invested in the best opportunities worldwide, which fueled these strong results. We remain mindful of global volatility risk. However, with the strong start and our confidence in continue to execute effectively, we are raising our net sales and EPS estimates for the year in constant currency. During the quarter, the external environment was challenging and we faced different issues in every region. Disruptions in Hong Kong affected commerce in that area. Continued uncertainty about Brexit impacted consumer spending in the UK and demand for makeup in North America softened. However, by having numerous growth engines across all facets of our business, we were able to deliver and exceed our sales and earnings expectations. Most of the over-achievement came from continued strengths in China and Travel Retail. We also had better-than-expected improvements across Europe and our other emerging markets. Also, contributed to our continued growth is our company positions in the sweet spot of consumer goods. Our brands generate superior consumer loyalty, evident in our strong repurchase rates. And while our high quality products justify premium pricing, they are an affordable luxury, which we believe, makes them more resilient to economic volatility than other luxury products. During the quarter, each of our four largest brands grew globally, reflecting strong consumer demand for established brands and their proven desirable product and compelling innovations. Estee Lauder and La Mer each advanced more than 20%. A key strategy is our focus on hero franchises which are the high repeat products in each brand. With greater innovation and resources around these hero product lines; our brands successfully attracted new consumers and reinforced their loyalty with existing ones. Our Estee Lauder brand is a great example of this winning strategy. The brand introduced a new product in its largest franchise Advanced Night Repair. Sales of the concentrate exceeded our expectations, and it helped lift the entire franchise by double-digits globally. In Asia, buzz around Estee Lauder new Intense Reset Concentrate broadened the brand reach about 70% of consumers who bought it were new to the brand, underscoring our strategic priority to attract new users with exciting innovations. Estee Lauder was one of several of our brands that benefited from rapid growth in the skincare category worldwide. We are well-positioned to meet the growing demand for all types of skincare products. It is our largest category and grew sharply accounting for nearly half of our global sales in the quarter. We continue to invest in skincare. La Mer gained share in luxury skin care in Asia Pacific and Clinique delivered a stronger global growth in several years driven by well received skin care innovations. One of Clinique's newest products, the Smart Clinical multidimensional moisturizer line resonated strongly with ageless consumers, particularly in North America and the UK. In other developments, our Tom Ford Beauty brand launched a luxury skincare collection to complement its successful fragrance and makeup offerings. Our makeup sales grew globally driven by a sharp uptick in Asia Pacific and Travel Retail as well as gains in the European region. The deceleration in prestige color cosmetics has been driven by Anglo market, but growth is still healthy in other geographies. And global companies like ours are well-positioned to grow in the category. Using enhanced data analytics and consumer insight that signal new and fast growing areas of demand, we invest in the promising subcategories as they emerge. For example, we knew the interest in foundations with skincare benefits was trending. With that insight, we develop new products around our hero foundations they offer hydrating and smoothing benefits. In our foundation business climbed 20% globally. We innovated with great success in other subcategories where we found granular opportunities. For example, MAC introduced Love Me lipstick, a breakthrough weightless and motorizing formula that offers lasting color. The product helped increase the brand lip business which climbed double-digits. Overall, our innovation was robust and new products accounting for 30% of our makeup category this quarter. Turning to our geographies. Our growth in China accelerated from the previous quarter, fueled by multiple engines. We had double-digit growth across all categories, all channels and nearly all brands. Our online business in China was strong. Our sales on Tmall doubled with growth across brands. We also successfully partnered with Tmall on special events, such as Jo Malone London Super Brand Day. Additionally, GLAMGLOW launched on the platform in September. Investing in emerging markets remains a strategic priority because we anticipate a continuation of growing demand for prestige beauty from the expanding middle class. Excluding China, as a group, this market rose double digits and they recruited several new consumers. Standout included Russia, Mexico, Brazil and Southeast Asia and we saw improvements in retail in Middle East. Our business in Hong Kong was challenged. Our sales declined 20% in the quarter and we have not seen sign of improvement to-date. However, since the last downturn in the market, we have re-positioned our business and increased sales with local consumers becoming less dependent on tourists, which was the most affected area. Our sales decline in Hong Kong was offset by an acceleration in the rest of Asia, reflecting strong consumer demand for our prestige brands and desirable products. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, every market grew, which added another growth driver and broadened our multiple engines. We were encouraged by strengths in the large Western European markets which advanced as well as many emerging markets in the region. Thanks in part to strong reception of our brand's innovation across categories. The North America market remained challenged by declining makeup sales, mainly in color cosmetics, as well as weak traffic in brick and mortar department store where we are the largest player. Although, our business generally reflected these trends, there were several bright spots. Our skincare business rose, several brands had higher sales and we had grown in key subcategories such as eye treatments or mascara. Typically, skincare makeup growth fluctuates depending on trends and innovation and can accelerate at different rates at different times. However, on average, over the last five years, both categories rose nearly 10% compounded annually in the US. We believe recent declines in color cosmetics in the US are due to several factors. Trends change and a more natural appearance is now involved, which requires fewer products that went contouring and other looks were popular. Also, the number of new product launches in makeup declined 20% in the last year, including forming the brands. In addition, Gen Z consumers are discovering the benefits of skin care, spurred by more social media activity in that category. Our brands continue to innovate strongly in both makeup and skincare. Clinique recently launched a new lipstick collection, which matches the consumer foundation shape with 28 new lipstick color based on the brand shade Match Science. This continues Clinique customization of beauty product that began with its successful Clinique at the skincare launch. Looking at our business by channel. Travel Retail and online globally again drove our performance. Travel Retail upward trajectory continued with strong double-digit sales growth, reflecting diversified growth engines across brands worldwide. Our products continue to resonate globally and like-door growth was robust. Among our top eight brands in the channel, all but one grew double-digits at retail. Digital campaigns and pre-ordering aimed at travelers before they start their trip helped boost sales. We expanded distribution for our newer artisanal fragrance brands and there is still much distribution expansion remaining for many brands in our portfolio that are only available in a small percentage of airports. Our online business also climbed strong double-digits. All types of online distribution grew substantially led by third-party sites and retailer sites. Traffic was higher and mobile commerce accounted for more than half of our e-commerce sales. We increased our advertising investment faster than our sales growth and continued to focus our spending on digital advertising, which accounted for 75% of the total. Our digital spending is mainly on advertising social media communications and search engines. Our brands are using many digital tools and experimenting with emerging social media platform to connect with consumers. For example, MAC launched a tool that lets consumer test over 100 lipstick shades on their own face by accessing the camera of their own phone and to simply research and purchasing. La Mer and Bobbi Brown launched voice search on their brand dot com sites in North America. We are proud of our results this quarter and confident we have the right plans in place for the rest of the year. Our brands have created many exciting products and promotions for the holiday period, in store and online for Cyber Monday and 11/11 in Asia and we believe consumers will be attracted by our compelling offerings. Looking ahead, we expect to further expand and magnify our multiple engine of growth across categories, brands, channels and geographies to better manage global volatility. We will continue to leverage our superb skincare growth and expect to gain even greater market share in that category. We have the best diversified pure-play in global prestige beauty with talented global teams and have profound local expertise, which makes us well positioned to pursue the fastest-growing areas around the world for any kind of consumer. At the same time, we will continue to transform our business as we anticipate what lies ahead and strengthen our entrepreneurial and competitive spirits. Now, I will turn the call over to Tracey. Let me start answering this question. I think the key point is I don't think stocks -- the key point here is that the color makeup market has softened. And there are certain companies like us and certain retailers which are more exposed to makeup than others. And this has fluctuations. And so in that quarter, that was the new news that we have managed around. And so the key idea is that when we see trends, we are able to anticipate and react to those trends. That's why we moderated the impact of this fluctuation on makeup, pushing more obviously our skincare business and continue building our distribution in the way that we want to focus it in the long term, meaning swinging the distribution toward high traffic, high performance channels and retailers gradually over time. So, the strategy continues. On top in North America, we have really improved our team, our capabilities, our ability to manage the market granularly exactly to anticipate and react to these trends very fast. We have better consumer insights; more local relevance and we have dramatically improved the ability to work online and our online business have been very solid. So, we are committed to improve the North America trends in the course of this fiscal year obviously even more in the long term. And this quarter was mainly, as I explained, a softer than expected color makeup business. Yes, that's fair. It is going to be more proactive segmentation. Also it's going to be innovation focused on this proactive segmentation. That's why in my prepared remark I explained that our innovation, for example, the Clinique innovation on makeup is more customized exactly to the opportunity we had identified. I also explained that frankly, when you don't look to the last quarter or the last six months, but you look to the last five years, the categories, makeup, skin care or even the subcategories like color cosmetic versus the foundation or moisturizer versus anti-aging had different situation and different trends. On average over the years, this category all been growing pretty well. In this moment, there is a softness in color makeup for a specific consumer-driven reason. I personally believe this will come back. It has always come back up and down over time. Yes. And also, I want to clarify because maybe this is not completely coming out from the fragrance number that our high-end fragrances so Jo Malone, Tom Ford continues to grow very strongly also in North America -- globally and in North America. So the fragrance number is 100% influenced by the base period of the launch of Estee Lauder in the past and scent designer fragrance performance, but our high-end fragrances continue to be strong performance, continue to become a bigger percentage of our business and we are at the moment of tilting the proportion. Yes. First of all, I want to say our estimate of the market is still very, very strong and the 5% to 6% is at the top of the historical averages. So to be clear, we continue to believe that this -- the prestige beauty is going to be one of the fastest growing market in consumer goods and that will continue to be in this moment on top of the historical averages. So, this is a great moment of growth overall. We have taken this point down in reflecting the reality of the softening of the color makeup, particularly in the Anglo market, specifically North America, UK, Australia and to reflect our assumption to a moderation of growth, in China and Travel Retail that however, to be clear, we have not yet seen happening, but just to be consistent with our future forecast and that's what we're seeing, but again, this is the most robust consumer market in the numbers and this robustness will continue in our estimate. Yes. And on top of what Tracey explained, obviously is the strength of this quarter -- the strengths of the last two years show that we are growing clearly ahead of market. So we are gaining market share. So it's not that we plan to do anything different. We continue to gain market share in a very good way, we are growing market share today. Our strategy for growing market share is not to spend aggressively in stable markets to fight market share in a zero-sum gain. Our strategy to grow market share is dictated by our Compass, where we anticipate where growth will come from and we build market share at the beginning of the growth trend. For example, in this moment, we are gaining significant market share in China. We are gaining significant market share in every single of the emerging markets of the world. We are gaining, again, market share in Europe, in Western Europe. We are gaining market share in most of the categories in the UK because of the softness on the market. And so we grow market share where we are taking the opportunity to really anticipate growth in areas that then in the future will increase dramatically so that our market share is also a reflection of mix where our high market share markets will become over time bigger and grow our global market share. So it's a very long-term-oriented game. And because of this, it's very efficient and our rate of return on the investment of our market share growth are excellent and I monitor it every day. The other big driver of market share growth is innovation. As we said, we had a robust innovation, a very, very good results in the success of our innovation. In the last years, we have improved it dramatically. Our speed of our innovation is improving; in this moment, we had about 70% of the innovation that we had developed from idea to market in 12 months and many other particularly makeup within six months. This was not possible in the past and this has reinforced our ability to grow market share via innovation in every market of the world. And then finally, our Leading Beauty Forward activities have created more flexibility for us to invest in advertising and advertising invested in the current way is the other increasing tool and increasing strength for us to grow market share globally. The contingency plan is the diversification of our business in the sense that we believe that the total beauty business globally will continue to grow healthy, as I just explained in the previous question. So we can argue, if this 5% to 6% or 6% to 7%, but those are the recent numbers. And this is sustainable in the long term as we have explained in our Analyst Day. So that being the base, however as we have demonstrated in this moment, that could be in a given market, a given category which is softer in this moment is color makeup in the United States as an example. And then what we do is that we are able to continue to try to improve in this category and using the softness also to build some market share. But most importantly, we are going to diversify our investment, our innovation, our marketing activation, our consumer repeat purchase activations and CRMs on where there is growth. And today we have the agility to move investment from maybe temporarily soft markets or categories to very, very high growth market and categories. This agility has improved, thanks to the increase of variable cost and reduction of fixed costs that Leading Beauty Forward provide and our flexibility to invest in advertising when needed. So, basically the answer -- the overall strategic answer to your question, the flexibility that we have is part of our multiple engine or growth strategy and the ability to continuously invest on where there is growth, where the return of our investment will be the highest not only financially, but also in term of growth in market share. Then going more in specific of the flexibility, we have taken this quarter -- I think this quarter, you can read it in many different ways, but for us it's a terrific demonstration of our multiple engine of growth. We are delivering a 12% growth globally and despite color makeup had one of the softer trends in Anglo markets in the last years, Hong Kong has been difficult, and North America business in total had a softer market than expected. Why? Because we have accelerated angry [ph] market share and deployed innovation in skincare in a terrific way across the globe in every single market because this quarter, 94% of our brands grew, basically all our portfolio is growing because Asia has further accelerated. China has further accelerated. TR has been super strong. Online continue to grow at the same strong level that's been growing for some years. In every single online channel, one data point which is interesting, our direct-to-consumer part of online, meaning where we have direct-to-consumer which include our brand dot com and Tmall, has been growing at 40%-plus. So we continue achieving more direct content with the consumers via that. And we have been able, despite this area of softness, to focus also on the area of strengths, adding total to beat our growth forecast. That I think is the key sign that we are trying to explain is the secret is not never having something in the world that doesn't work. With such a big category, something will go wrong somewhere, but now we have the flexibility to move in order to always try our best to deliver the total and progress the total in term of growth, EPS and market share. So let's start to the core of your question. China market continued to grow, the beauty market above 20%. So the market is super solid. We grew much more than that and we built significant market share. In the quarter, we built almost 2 full points of market share, so significant market share in the market. And so both the market and our market share gains are working together in that sense. What is driving that? First of all, we are in China for the long term. We have a local organization which is terrific and understand the local relevance of the market. We are able to invest in all the area of growth. In this moment in China, there is a lot of growth that is coming also not only for Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities, which has been true for some time, but Tier 3 sorry and Tier 4 city are accelerating significantly, which is what is reflected in the acceleration of Tmall that you are referring to. Let me explain what the dynamic here. Historically in China, there was no national advertising. We could invest where we had distribution. So if you had stores in Shanghai, you could invest in print in Shanghai. With the advent of social media, social media is national. And because of this, there is the possibility of creating demand nationally even if distribution for the moment is -- our most distributed brand is in totally 121 cities, while in reality, there is social media impact and demand created in over 600 cities. So there are hundreds of cities with million inhabitants with growing middle class that for the moment do not have access to physical distribution. And obviously, the two drivers of their consumption is TR and Tmall and online brand.com site like ours. So obviously, over time, distribution will increase and physical distribution will make more inroads into these cities. But for the time being, online is basically the way in which demand gets satisfied. And with that dynamic is a long-term dynamic and will continue for some time independently from temporary or not softness or economic variations. But this long-term is driven by middle class demographics and by the passion for beauty of the Chinese population, and frankly, for the Asian population as a whole. So this is the trend and I believe that our position is strong and the forecast for the market in the long term remains as strong as possible. And I think the other part you referred to China. We said, no, our market point of view is that 5% to 6% growth is a super strong growth that will continue at the high end as explained of the historical range, but we have reflected the softening of the makeup North America market in our global estimate. And then we continue to assume that there could be a softening of the China market in the future, but as I said, we have not seen it yet. I just commented that actually we see an acceleration in this moment, but we believe this is a prudent assumption in the current global economic situation. Yes. And by the way, to go to your point, I've explained all our great strengths, strategic strengths, the flexibility, the agility, the ability to leverage all channel. That's why we believe that even if there was a slowdown, we will continue to build market share and we'll continue to be ahead of the market. That's the strengths we've built. And if there will be no slowdown, we will over-deliver and that's what happened this quarter. And it happened frankly even in case there was one element, that actually was worse than our expectation. There was the makeup color market in the US. So even in presence of one element, that was actually a surprise, we still over-deliver because all the other elements, first of all, the strategic execution that I commented on and second, the overall trend of the market in Asia is now slowdown and our strategy execution is excellent and so we have over-delivered. And that's the situation. In this moment, as you see also, currencies have impacted in a way which were different than our guidance just few months ago. So there're many variables that we are trying to take under account, but the strengths of our model and the ability to navigate good times and bad times, growing market share, doing better than market that I believe is by now really proven. Yes. Yes, interesting question. So as I explained also in my prepared remark, what we define hero products in our portfolio is actually products with high repeat rates and a decent purchase frequency, meaning products that have not only the power to make the consumer loyal, but also they have to bring the consumer to the repurchase return that create traffic in stores for our partners and for ourselves. So these products are very precious in the portfolio and to build product like that, marketing is not enough. You need superior quality and great performance because I know many people, including myself, that is tempted to try new stuff one time to try new things, but I don't know any person that buys these things the second time if this product didn't perform in line with expectation and that's what we mean. We invest into high quality R&D, high quality manufacturing, safety, clinical test, product that really work and not only they work in term of performance and they have the kind of texture and usage experience that made the consumer delighted about what design and that investments that at the end is the essence of our premium pricing strategy. That investment creates repeat purchase. This is still a very big differentiator between on average our portfolio and the portfolio of indie brands. If you look at the numbers, the difference in repeat are still significant because also the difference of repeat are driven by quality, innovation and by the ability to delight the consumer over the long term. So we believe this is a strength which is not being mitigated. In your question, you speak about new threat. Frankly, on that topic, I don't see new threat. Actually, I see new strengths and it is from new strengths for our brands, not for the indie brands. And to prove that, is that this is the first quarter in some time where each one of our big brands is growing globally and the total of them is growing faster than any combination of our indie brands; and so it is really an extraordinary, if you want proof of the point, that repeat purchase is the biggest driver of prestige beauty."

            "name": "Tracey Travis",
            "content": "Thank you, Fabrizio, and good morning everyone. As a reminder, my commentary today is adjusted for the items that Rainey mentioned at the beginning of the call and net sales growth numbers are in constant currency. And now for the quarter results. Net sales for the first quarter rose 12% driven by strong growth in our international regions and in our skincare category. Asia, Travel Retail and online continued to deliver strong growth and our European and Latin America market sales growth accelerated, while sales in North America remain challenged. From a geographic standpoint, our Asia Pacific region net sales rose 26%, with more than half of the markets contributing double-digit increases. Sales in Greater China rose strong double-digits. Our sales in Mainland China continued to deliver broad-based growth across cities, brands, categories and channels as we gained share and as anticipated, our sales in Hong Kong fell 20%. Among developed markets in APAC, both Japan and Korea delivered double-digit sales growth this quarter. Our sales in Japan which grew a solid 7% last fiscal year, accelerated even further within the quarter in anticipation of an October 1st VAT increase the country. In Korea, sales in specialty-multi and online distribution were robust. And we gained share in department stores. Southeast Asia grew double-digits led by Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam. Net sales in our Europe, the Middle East and Africa region rose 19%, with every market contributing to growth. Our Global Travel retail business rose strong double-digits led by quarters across Asia. Strong like-door growth drove the majority of the increase in Travel Retail, and was supplemented by the rapid development of online pre-ordering. Our emerging markets in the region grew high-single digits, led by a double-digit increase in Russia and the Middle East. Western markets grew mid-single digits, led by Switzerland and Greece. Our sales in the UK grew modestly this quarter despite continued challenges in brick and mortar retail. Some retailers bought extra stock this quarter ahead of the anticipated hard Brexit and our online business in the UK continued to grow double-digits. Net sales in the Americas, declined 6%. Brick and mortar retail remained difficult especially in department stores. As you know, the makeup category in North America has been declining and we are the leading prestige company in the category. We continue to invest where we saw the best opportunities for growth. Skincare showed good growth driven by Estee Lauder, Clinique and La Mer, in their hero franchises. Within makeup, we saw solid growth with some key subcategories such as mascara. And while our fragrance business was particularly soft this quarter, it is expected to pick up in the holiday quarter. Looking at the region by channel, North America sales rose in both brand and retailer online as well as in freestanding retail stores. Our sales in the specialty-multi channel also grew at retail. Our Estee Lauder brand and most luxury brands grew in North America this quarter. In addition, sales in Latin America grew double-digits in all major markets. From a category standpoint, skincare led growth this quarter. Net sales accelerated to 25% with strong contributions from Estee Lauder, La Mer and Clinique. Innovations such as Estee Lauder Advanced Night Repair Intense, Reset Concentrate, LA Mer the Regenerating Serum and Clinique's Smart-Clinical multi-dimensional line, contributed incremental sales and supported hero franchises. And the historical strength of Origins and natural skincare helped drive the brand's double-digit gains. Net sales in makeup grew 4%, with strong double-digit growth in Asia and Travel Retail led by strong innovations and support behind foundation and lip products from Estee Lauder, MAC, Lamar and Tom Ford Beauty. Sales of fragrances declined 1% as sales in luxury and artisanal brands were offset by declines in designer fragrances. Clinique and Estee Lauder which had a tough comparison to the prior year launch of Beautiful Belle. Innovations this quarter included Poppy & Barley from Jo Malone, METALLIQUE from Tom Ford and new City Exclusives from Le Labo. Fragrance sales grew in all international regions, but were soft in the Americas region as I mentioned earlier. Our hair care sales declined 4% driven by a tough comparison to the prior year launch of Cherry Almond shampoo and conditioner from Aveda, as well as lower sales from Bumble and bumble in North America. Our gross margin declined 10 basis points compared to the first quarter last year. Higher obsolescence and sourcing costs were mostly offset by pricing and favorable skincare category mix. Operating expenses as a percent of sales improved 120 basis points. Continued leverage of our cost base due to greater efficiencies in our selling model and store operating costs more than covered higher advertising investments to build awareness in critical growth markets and support our innovations globally. Operating income rose 17% and operating margin increased by 110 basis points. Diluted EPS of $1.67 increased 19% compared to the prior year and grew 20% in constant currency. EPS was higher than expected due to the stronger sales growth with greater operating leverage and a slightly favorable tax rate. During the quarter, we utilized $170 million in net cash flows from operating activities, which was below the prior year, due primarily to timing differences in accounts payable and we invested $125 million in capital expenditures. We used $313 million to repurchase 1.6 million shares of our stock and paid $156 million in dividends. We also announced this morning a 12% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.48 per share. Now, let's turn to our outlook for next quarter and for the full year. We are pleased obviously with the strong start to our fiscal year, but we recognize that a variety of macro risks such as ongoing trade tensions, Brexit and continued challenges in Hong Kong's retail environment could impact our fiscal 2020 results. Nonetheless, we believe our multiple engines of growth strategy will continue to deliver strong global results. For the year, we are raising our sales growth expectation by one point to 8% to 9% in constant currency. This still assumes a moderation of growth in China in Travel Retail in the back half of the year. Despite the market conditions in place today, we expect our North America business to gradually improve fueled by innovations in skincare and foundations, better fragrance performance during holiday and strong growth online. Currency translation is expected to negatively affect reported sales growth by 1 percentage point, reflecting weighted average rates of $1.09 for the euro, $1.23 for the pound and $7.12 for the won for the fiscal year. EPS is expected to range between $5.85 and $5.93 before restructuring and other charges. This includes approximately $0.05 of dilution from currency translation. As you are most likely aware, currency rates have moved about 3% to 4% since our last guidance, which was based on rates as of June 30th, the spot rate. The won, euro and pound have all weakened relative to the US dollar and created a currency swing of approximately $0.10 on our annual expectations for EPS. So the currency impact previously was a plus $0.05 that we were expecting for the year and we are now expecting a minus $0.05 EPS impact based on the September 30th spot rates. For the second quarter, net sales are expected to increase approximately 8% to 9% in constant currency. Currency translation is expected to negatively impact growth by 1 percentage point. Therefore we expect reported net sales to grow between 7% and 8%. EPS is forecast between $1.83 and $1.86 before restructuring charges. This includes about $0.02 dilution from currency. With a strong start to the fiscal year, we are optimistic about our ability to execute our plans to deliver another year of top line growth, margin expansion and double-digit EPS improvement. And with that, that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time. I would also add more in that. We did have an unusual anniversarying of a very strong launch period last quarter from a fragrance standpoint last year with Estee Lauder Beautiful Belle and some of our other designer fragrances, and we are comfortable and quite encouraged by our holiday programs for the second quarter. And obviously taking up the year certainly reflects there the performance that we saw in the first quarter. So I'll start and then Fabrizio will continue. So, Olivia, we're seeing strong growth in Asia. We're seeing very strong growth, as we've called out previously in Travel Retail. We're seeing also an acceleration in EMEA as well. So some of the things that give us confidence in terms of gaining market share, it's less about North America at the moment, although we clearly expect to see, as I said in my prepared remarks, modest improvements in North America throughout the course of the year, but from a share standpoint, we really expect to gain share outside of North America in our international markets as well as good growth in online as well. Okay. So let me start with your second question, Wendy. In terms of the gross margin, there are many factors that impact gross margin, obviously. And clearly, skincare is a benefit from a gross margin standpoint. Certain channels are a benefit from a gross margin standpoint as well. As we've called out, we have given where growth is coming from for us, a lot in Asian markets and you're aware of our footprint. We do have more supply chain expenses related to supporting some of the terrific double-digit growth that we've had and certainly that growth being in the Eastern part of the world has increased both inventory levels as well as transit costs. The tariffs, we've also spoken about the fact that we do have and have included some of the higher tariffs that have been called out in our gross margin as well. So we are seeing some shifts upside related to category mix and some geographic mix, offset by some of those other factors related to freight as well as obsolescence and some of the supply chain costs related to tariffs, etcetera. In terms of the balance sheet, our general philosophy as it relates to free cash flow is to return free cash flow to shareholders if in fact, we don't have any acquisitions that we are contemplating. We are always in the market looking for the right strategic acquisitions that will represent white space opportunity for us and incremental sales and profit growth. We also have minority investments that we have a path to purchase as well. So, we definitely consider acquisitions as an important strategic growth opportunity for us, the right acquisitions that again represent a good fit within our portfolio. If we have no acquisitions that are at the right price and represent those white space opportunities, then generally -- and we have this discussion every year with our board, we return 100% of free cash flow to shareholders via dividends and share repurchase activity. And you're aware as well, we have also increased our CapEx this year to reinvest back in the business again to support long-term growth. So I think our capital deployment in terms of the cash, even though you're seeing a little bit extra on the balance sheet is, in the highest return areas in terms of how we strategically allocate it for our purposes as well as for shareholder purposes. Okay, let me start. I'll start with your question on Japan. So as I'm sure you're aware, the Japan market had a VAT increase starting on October 1st. So typically -- and we have this experience from the last time, there was a VAT increase in the market. We do see some acceleration of purchases into the month prior to the increase, which is expected. It typically normalizes out during the course of the year. So the reason I commented on the fact that we're coming off of a 7% growth last year from Japan, we certainly expect Japan for the year will normalize out to the levels of very strong growth that we've seen and we're very pleased with the pickup that we've seen in Japan over the last couple of years, really a testament to the great team that we have in Japan and what they've been doing in the market. As it relates to North America, we did say and I did say in my prepared remarks, we expect gradual improvement. We did talk about the fact that we have seen further deceleration in North America. Fabrizio talked about the color makeup challenges that we, along with others, have spoken about in the market. So depending on your definition of stabilization, we certainly expect to see improvement from the results that we saw in the first quarter. And again, we had some unusual anniversarying items in the first quarter as well, but -- so we expect to see gradual improvement from the first quarter results throughout the balance of the year for North America. So, I think -- this is Tracey and then Fabrizio will respond. In the second half, we're -- I think your numbers are a little soft. If you do the math, it's more in the 6% to 7% range in terms of what we're expecting in the second half of the year with the moderation that we spoke about in -- as it relates to China and Travel Retail. And again, given the global backdrop and the global environment, it has nothing to do with our business. It is really a point of view with respect to what could happen to global markets given the fact that there are global macro slowdowns, even though we haven't in fact seen it in China and haven't seen it affect our Asia business in general, which is quite strong, but it certainly could happen. And so as we plan our business, plan our resources in the second half of the year, clearly if it doesn't happen, then we'll continue to have the kind of results that we had in the first quarter, but we think it's responsible for us to expect what many economists are projecting in terms of a slowdown in the second half of the year. Thank you for recognizing the fact that we are operating quite well in a very difficult market."

And now I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio.\nFabrizio Freda: Thank you, Rainey and hello everyone. I hope you and your families are in good health. In our hearts, continue to be with those impacted by COVID-19. We delivered outstanding performance amid the pandemic in fiscal year 2021, capped with an exceptional fourth quarter empowered by our dynamic multiple engines of growth strategy, as well as the timeless desirability of prestige beauty. In a year of pain and sorrow, our employees cared for each other, their families, and our Company with compassion, creativity, and results. While the challenges of COVID-19 persist, we confidently begin Fiscal year 2022 as a stronger Company full of aspiration for the opportunities of tomorrow. For Fiscal Year 2021, sales rose 11%, as we pivoted our energy resources to the growth engines of skincare, fragrance, Asia-Pacific, travel retail in Asia-Pacific, and global online. Impressively, 8 brands grew double-digits, led by Estee Lauder, La Mer, and Jo Malone London. Multiple waves and variance of COVID-19 to extend the center reach were unexpected a year ago drove volatility and variability throughout the year. We saw reopening reversed to closing and reopening in one market met with renewed lockdowns in other markets. Despite this, we delivered on the goal we set last August for sales growth to improve sequentially each quarter. Our sales exceeded $16 billion for the first time ever, up 9% from Fiscal year 2019 on a reported basis, fueled by skincare and fragrance. Adjusted Operating margin expanded to 18.9%, which is 140 Basis points above Fiscal year 2019. As we invested in today's strongest growth engines, managed cost with discipline and funded long-term growth opportunities. Adjusted diluted earnings per share rose 21% relative to 2 years ago. We delivered these excellent results while pushing our social impact and sustainability goals and commitment. First and foremost, we remain focused on employee and consumer safety and well-being. We achieved important milestones for our 2025 sustainability goals, expanded our inclusion, diversity and equity programs, defined a strategy for Women's advancement and gender equality and advanced work towards our racial equity commitments. Here are a few among the many areas of our progress. We achieved net-zero carbon emissions and 100% renewable electricity globally, for our own operations. We also set science-based emissions reductions targets, addressing scope 1 and 2 for our direct operation and certain elements of scope 3 for our value chain signaling our new level of ambition for climate options. We launched ingredient [Indiscernible] for seven additional brands, such that 11 brands now offer these insightful content. We transformed our tradition inclusion, diversity and equity week into a blockbuster virtual experience with 35 events involving thousands of participants from 25 countries. We also introduced new educational offerings, including four anti-racist and inclusive leadership. We expanded our gross root to add employee resource groups, which served as a source of support and comfort throughout the turmoil of last year. The women leadership network is our largest group and is now global with it's a expansion into Latin America and Asia-Pacific. We created two new leadership programs for women and Black employees. The open door women's leadership program is a unique, intensive course to develop our next-generation of women leaders. Building on its success, we designed the open doors collection, a self-guided program to bring these leadership skills to all our employees around the world. The [Indiscernible] chair leadership and development program as successfully held to ensure that black employees have equitable access to leadership training's, mentorship, career development, and advancement opportunity, as well as to build a stronger, more inclusive network of talent across the organization by promoting visibility and facilitating leadership connections points with participants. Our new partnership with Howard University focused on its alumina, hosted 12 engaging events and launched an accelerator program to help increase the pipeline for black talent with career, coaching, professional training, and self-empowering networking. Let me now turn to product Innovation, which serve as an impossible catalysts for growth in Fiscal year 2021. Innovation represented over 30% of sales, exceeding our expectations. We combined data analytics with our creative talent and R&D to successfully anticipate, scale and set trends across categories. The Estee Lauder brand achieved its fourth consecutive year of double-digit sales growth in fiscal year 2021, fueled by strength across its many hero franchises in skin care. Trusted products along with innovation were highly sold from Shanghai to New York, Paris, and now Sao Paolo, given the brand's well-received launch in Brazil. Advanced Night Repair newly preformulated serum sparked excellent sales growth. Revitalizing Supremes\u2019, New Supreme Bright moisturizer further bolstered the accelerating franchise, while the Nutriv new eye serum served and created a halo effect on demand. In makeup, the brand's double wear, futurist and pure Clorox franchises produced significant double-digit sales growth in the fourth quarter. An exciting early signs of makeup river source. La Mer delivered outstanding double-digit Sales growth in the fiscal year. As innovation sort an engaging campaigns with iconic ingredient base narratives drove demand for its hero products. The new genesence de La Mer concentrated on a bulb proved highly sold after and expanded the brand's ultra-luxury franchise. It is both large count new consumers and captivated, loyal consumers globally. Clinique Skin Care accelerate in fiscal year 2021. Sales rose double digits and powered the brands to high single-digit sales growth. The brand successfully met consumer needs through the launch of Moisture Surge 100H with its unique hydration benefits and target solutions for how to solve skincare problems like Even Better Clinical Interrupter. Clinique showcased its promise for makeup renaissance, with Stellar double-digit category growth in the Fourth Quarter, with the new Even Better Clinical Serum Foundation and Even Better Concealer capitalizing on its skincare authority. All told, our robust skincare Portfolio from entry prestige to luxury in across subcategories, is fulfilling this journey needs around the world [Indiscernible] with its [Indiscernible], brand positioning and Hero products delivered strong double-digit organic sales growth in the second half of Fiscal year 2021. In May, we amplified the strength of our skincare Portfolio as we became majority owner of DECIEM with its coveted ingredient base brand, the ordinary, an emerging science driven neared brand as part of its Portfolio. Complementing skincare strengths, fragrance delivered striking sequential sales growth acceleration throughout the year. Each of our luxury and artisanal fragrance brand contributed meaningfully from Jo Malone, London to Tom Ford Beauty, Le Labo, Kilian Paris and Frederic Malle. In both established fragrance markets of the west and emerging fragrance market of the East, Tom Ford Beauty's Private Blend franchise is both recruiting new consumers and driving stronger tips in marketing newly embracing the category with the brand's dragon Sales more than doubling in Mainland China during the year. The Asia-Pacific region was another dynamic growth engine in Fiscal Year 2021. Its annual sales growth accelerated from 18% to 22%, led by Mainland China where sales rose strong double digits. Korea grew organically. Several smaller markets also contributed to Asia-Pacific strength. The region, however, experienced increasing pressure from the pandemic as the year evolved, with Japan and many markets in Southeast Asia particularly impacted from renewed lockdowns in the second half. Mainland China prospered, as we invested in its vibrancy of today and opportunity of tomorrow. We entered more cities, reaching 145, expanded our presence specialty multi, opened freestanding doors and increased our advertising spending. Skincare fragrance sales grew strong double-digit for the Fiscal year. We are encouraged that the makeup accelerated to double-digit sales growth in the second half, our brands delivered excellent results for the key events of T-Mobile's 1111 global shopping festival and 618 mid-year shopping festival as engaging live streaming generated product discovery for many new consumers. For the recent 618, among Tmall Beauty Flagship Stores, the Estee Lauder brand ranked number 1 in Total Beauty, while La Mer ranked 1st in Luxury Beauty, and Jo Malone London led the fragrance category. To further capture the market recent online growth opportunity, we are continuing to invest in Tmall and brand.com to expand our capabilities. Most recently, some brands increased coverage of a different demographics by launching already in July. With international travel, larger curtailed, we expanded our investment in the dynamic Travel retail development of Hainan highland to serve the Chinese consumers in the best possible way, given the island's tremendous traffic growth in higher duty-free purchase limits. Our brands further elevated the installed and prepaid shopping experiences, delivered ideal merchandising, and leveraged live streaming to drive strong sales growth. Looking at channels, online thrived globally in fiscal year 2021 characterized by strong double-digit sales gains and step change in its power as a growth engine. We accelerated our consumer-facing digital infrastructure and fulfillment investments. The challenge is now more than twice as big as it was two years ago and greatly benefit from its diversification as each of brand.com, third-party platforms, retail.com and [Indiscernible] of retailers delivered outstanding performance. During the year, brand.com came to epitomize their lure of a luxury flack sheet store for each brands localized by market and re-imagined with our classic High-Touch services.

Clinique, this happens campaigns on TikTok became a viral sensation, highlighting the brand's acne solution, exploring the creation of nearly 700,000 videos on the app. Together, these and other strategic actions delivered exceptional results for brand.com as new consumers, conversion, basket size, repeat, and loyalty members grew considerably. Beyond the favorable growth rates, the data relationship with Frosted with consumers enabled us to better optimize engagement in-store and online, offering exciting future growth opportunities. We are investing across all channels of online, collaborating with traditional and pure-play retailers on initiatives to actualize Prestige Beauty online potential. We spoke on the last call about heading expanded our presence with Tour Player retailers, which continued into the Fourth Quarter, most especially in EMEA. And as I discussed a few minutes ago, we are expanding our consumer coverage in Mainland China. For Fiscal Year 2022, we expect these growth engines of Skincare, Fragrance Asia-Pacific, Travel Retail Asia-Pacific, and Global Online to continue to try, owing to our strong repeat purchase rates, sophisticated data analytics -derived consumer acquisitions, and retention. high-touch online services, and robust innovation pipeline. Three compelling skincare innovation recently launched. Estee Lauder's new advanced night repair eye matrix is focused on lines in every eyed zone, while La Mer De Hydrating Infused Emulsion is designed to replenish, strengthen, stabilize skin with healing moisture and has already proven to attract new consumers. Clinic -- Smart Clinical retail wrinkled correcting Serum is designed to visibly reduced stubborn lines. Our Shanghai Innovation Center is expected to open in the second half of this fiscal year. In reaching our capability in product design, formulation, consumer insight, and trend analytics for Chinese and Asian consumers. Also, with the new center, our East to West innovation will benefit, enabling us to create more successes like Estee Lauder futurist Hydra or Supreme Bright, and La Mer, the treatment lotion. As the world emerged from the pandemic, we will be the best diversified pure-play in prestige beauty as more engines of growth contribute across categories, geographies, and channels. Makeup and hair care are poised to gradually reignite as growth engines. As our developed markets in the West in Brick-and-mortar retail. Growth in emerging markets is expected to resume over time as vaccination rates increase. We anticipate the momentum in makeup will build around the world driven by local reopening, an increasing social and professional user education, just as we saw in the fourth quarter. Indeed, makeups started to improve to the end of Fiscal year 2021, driven by our Hero of sub-categories of foundation and mascara. Newness in the category was highly sold, evidenced by the success of MAC magic extension Mascara to face Lip Plumper, Smashbox hollowed, tinted moisturizers, and Bobbi Brown sheer pressie power contributing to makeup emerging Renaissance, MAC launched MAC The Moment. It campaign linking its makeup products in artistry inspire trends to key experiences such as date night, parties, weddings, and back-to-school shopping Too Faced expanded into brows in July with the collection that includes an innovative brow gel, that adds color and texture. Similar to makeup, hair care is set to benefit from the rise of socially professional use education, as well as saloon reopening. Aveda, which is now 100% vegan and Bumble and bumble enter fiscal year 2022 with momentum owing to desirable innovation and reached consumer engagement for strong online performance globally over the past year. As makeup and hair care vein yard, we expect our engines of growth will gradually diversify by geography and channel, initially driven by developed markets in the west and over time by emerging markets in the U.S., the Fourth Quarter, we aligned innovation, advertised spending and store activations as consumer returned to stores, eager to explore beauty and steer in high-touch services. Across brick-and-mortar from regional and national department stores to specialty [inaudible] and freestanding stores, our business in the U.S. prospered, most especially in makeup and fragrance, and exceeded our expectations. As we start our new fiscal year, Bobbi Brown recently debuted in Ulta Beauty. Several of our brands launched online and in-store with Sephora at Kohl's and Ulta Beauty at Target. In closing. We leverage the power of our multiple engines of growth strategy to elevate the Company to new heights in Fiscal year 2021. We did this while leaving our values with the health and well-being of our employees as primary focus in making post and progress on our social impact commitment and sustainability goals. Our success in agility, in operating and in the challenges of the past year, give us confidence for Fiscal year 2022 as we expect volatility of variability from the pandemic to persist for some time to come. This year, we are celebrating our 75th anniversary as a Company and beginning our next 75 years, incredibly inspired by the opportunities of tomorrow as the leading global house of prestige beauty with the most talented employees, to whom I extend my deepest gratitude. I will now turn the call over to Tracey.\nTracey Travis: Thank you for [Indiscernible] and hello, everyone. I concur with Fabrizio in thanking our incredible team who have demonstrated great resilience during the pandemic. Navigating through the highly uneven recovery this past year has certainly required greater agility and flexibility and our teams across the globe rose to the occasion, delivering superb results for the Fiscal year, while also establishing a stronger foundation for future growth and profitability. We delivered exceptional net sales growth of 56% in our fourth quarter as we anniversary pandemic-related store closures in the prior year. The inclusion of six weeks of sales from DECIEM added approximately three points to growth in the quarter. Our performance also exceeded the pre-pandemic levels of the Fiscal 2019 Fourth Quarter by 9% driven by significant sales increases in Mainland China, the skincare and fragrance categories, global online, and travel retail in Asia. All three regions grew and all product categories within each region grew during the Quarter. Net sales in the Americas region rose 86% against the prior-year period with almost no brick-and-mortar retail open. Throughout the quarter, consumer confidence in the U.S. grew as COVID restrictions abated and people resume shopping in stores again. Our brands responded with strong program supporting recovery, new product launches, and animating key brand shopping events like Mother's Day. Sales in the region remained below Fiscal '19 level for the quarter, reflecting in part the loss of over 900 retail locations that represented nearly 170 million in annual sales. Additionally, makeup has historically been the largest category in the region, and the category has yet to fully recouped sales loss during the pandemic. Nevertheless, we are encouraged by the sequential acceleration in North American sales, which has been better than we expected. Net Sales in our Europe, the Middle East, and Africa region increased 65% with all markets contributing to growth as COVID restrictions eased throughout the Quarter. Global Travel Retail, which is primarily reported in this region, continued to suffer from a significant drop in international travel traffic, but grew strong double-digits in the Quarter as comparisons eased and local tourism in China, especially to Hainan remained robust. Across developed markets in the region, store traffic has begun to pick up and retailers have become more comfortable with restocking. Emerging markets in the region saw strong retail in the Quarter, driven by locally relevant holiday activation, retailer events, and online performance. Sales in the region were slightly above Fiscal '19 levels for the Quarter, primarily due to the resilience of travel retail. Net sales in the Asia-Pacific region rose 30%. Virtually every country contributed to growth, although the pace of improvement varied widely among the markets and a resurgence of COVID has slowed a full recovery. Sales of our products online continued to rise strong double-digit in the region driven by the successful 618 Shopping Festival campaign in China and including the continued strength of social e-commerce. Mainland China continued to experience robust double-digit growth with broad-based improvement across product categories, brands and channels. Other markets in the region, including Korea, Hong Kong and Japan grew exceptionally against prior year Brick-and-mortar lockdown. Sales in the region were 50% above 2019 levels, largely reflecting China's rapid emergence from the pandemic last year. Net sales in all product categories grew sharply this quarter. And skin care, fragrance and hair care drove higher sales than Fiscal 2019. Fragrance-led growth with net sales rising 150% versus prior-year. Luxury fragrances resonated with consumers looking for self-care and indulgence and among Chinese consumers, increasingly attracted to the category. Home, bath, and body products have also gained traction during the pandemic and helped to attract new consumers. Jo Malone London saw recovery to pre-pandemic levels in Brick-and-mortar. And the brands Blossom and Brit collections were popular in Asia. Standouts from Tom Ford Beauty include the recent launch of Tubereuse Nue and the continued strength of Bitter Peach and Rose Prick. Net sales in makeup jumped 70% against the prior year that reflected the greatest beauty category impact of COVID-19, particularly in western markets, where makeup is the largest category. The makeup category in prestige beauty has proven to be especially sensitive to brick-and-mortar recovery due to the use of testers and in-store services by consumers. Estee Lauder saw strong growth of Futurist and Double Wear foundations in Asia, and MAC liquid lip colour and eye products, especially mascara, outperformed. Haircare net sales grew 52% as salons and stores reopened. The launch of Aveda's Blonde Revival Shampoo and Conditioner also contributed to category growth. Adding to other strong innovation programs over the past several months from Aveda. Net sales in skincare continued to thrive. They rose 42% in the quarter driven by strong increases from the La Mer Estee Lauder, Clinique and [Indiscernible] with its brands, particularly in Asia. Skincare sales growth also benefited from the addition of DECIEM in the quarter by approximately 4% points. Our Gross margin improved 650 Basis points compared to the fourth quarter last year. This favorability reflected significant improvements in obsolescence and manufacturing efficiencies compared to the prior year impact of COVID-19 on our Sales and on our manufacturing locations. Operating expenses rose 36% driven by the planned increase in advertising and selling costs to support the reopening of retail and the recovery. Additionally, we sharply curtailed spending last year in response to the onset of the pandemic and some of these costs were reinstated, primarily compensation. We delivered operating income of 385 million for the Quarter compared to a $228 million operating loss in the prior-year quarter. Diluted earnings per share of $0.78 included $0.02 of favorable currency translation and $0.02 dilution from the acquisition of DECIEM. Our full-year results reflect the benefits of our strategic focus as we leaned into current growth drivers and invested behind future areas of growth, while effectively managing both costs and cash. The sequential acceleration of our business throughout the year culminated in net sales growth of 11%. The strength of Chinese consumer demand, both at home and in travel retail, the resilience of the skincare and fragrance categories, and the momentum we drove in our online channels, all supported our growth. Our distribution mix continued to revolve even as Brick-and-mortar reopened. Sales of our products through all online channels continued to thrive as they rose 34% for the year and represented 28% of Sales. Despite the continued curtailment of international travel, our business in the Travel retail channel grew ending Fiscal 2021 at 29% of Sales. Among Brick-and-mortar retail, specialty multi and perfumeries grew while department stores and freestanding stores experienced the greatest impact from the ongoing pandemic and declined for the year. Our Gross margin rose 120 Basis points to 76.4% driven by favorable pricing, lower obsolescence, increased manufacturing efficiencies and lower costs for testers and stores and partially offset by currency due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar. Operating expenses declined 300 Basis points to 57.5% of sales. Selling and store operating costs decreased as high service stores were either closed for part of the year or they reopened with reduced traffic and staffing levels. Additionally, in-store merchandising costs decreased while advertising investments, primarily Digital media, rose faster than Sales to support our brands in the recovery. We achieved significant savings from our cost initiatives, including Leading Beauty Forward and the preliminary benefits from the Post-COVID Business Acceleration Program. And this gave us the flexibility to reinvest in necessary capabilities, absorbed some of the inflation and media and logistics costs, as well as support the reinstatement of certain compensation elements that were reduced or frozen due to the onset of the pandemic. Our full-year Operating margin was 18.9%. representing a 420 basis-point improvement over last year and 140 basis points above Fiscal 2019. This year also includes 50 basis points of dilution from the inclusion of Dr. Jart and DECIEM. Our effective tax rate for the year was 18.7%, a decrease of 450 basis points over the prior year, primarily driven by the geographic mix of earnings, which included a favorable one-time adjustment for Fiscal Years 2019 and 2020 related to recently issued GILTI Tax Regulation s. Net earnings rose 57% to $2.4 billion and diluted EPS increased 57% to $6.45. Earnings per share includes $0.11 accretion from currency translation and $0.08 dilution from the acquisitions of Dr. Jart and DECIEM. In Fiscal 2021, we recorded 148 million after-tax or $0.40 per share of impairment charges related to our Smashbox and GLAMGLOW brands, as well as certain freestanding retail stores. Restructuring and other charges related primarily to the Post-COVID Business Acceleration Program, were 176 million after-tax or $0.48 per share. These charges were more than offset by the one-time gain on our minority interest in DECIEM of 847 million after-tax or $2.30 per share. The Post-COVID Business Acceleration Program is progressing quickly with projects underway across all regions. We have closed nearly 500 doors or counters, including about 50 freestanding stores under the program in Fiscal 2021. We also closed approximately 100 additional freestanding stores outside of the program and upon lease expiration, primarily in North America and in Europe. We've realigned our go-to-market organizations to better reflect our evolving channel mix. We're also winding down certain brands such as BECCA and Rodan. These actions are expected to continue into Fiscal 2022. For the total program, we continue to expect to take charges of between 400 million and 500 million through Fiscal 2022 and generate savings of 300 to 400 million before tax by Fiscal 2023, a portion of which will be reinvested. We continue to focus on maintaining strong liquidity while also investing for future growth during the year. Cash generated from operations rose 59% to $3.6 billion were primarily reflecting the higher net earnings. We utilized 637 million for Capital improvements, supporting increased capacity and other supply chain improvements, further e-commerce development and information technology. We repaid 750 million of Debt outstanding from our revolving credit facility, issued 600 million of new long-term Debt and retired 450 million of Debt. We used 1.1 billion net of cash acquired to increase our ownership interest in DECIEM. And we returned 1.5 billion in cash to Stakeholders during the year via increased Dividends and the reinstatement of share repurchase activities in the second half of the Fiscal year. So looking ahead to Fiscal 2022, we are encouraged by the increasing vaccination rates and reopening of markets around the world. We look forward to the resumption of international travel, increasing foot traffic and Brick-and-mortar retail and the development of our recent acquisitions. We are still mindful, however, that the recovery has evolved unevenly and some markets are seeing their third or fourth waves of COVID, including increasing effects of new more contagious strains of the virus, hindering a return to normal life. This has been particularly evident in the U.S. over the past several weeks. Additionally, increasing climate and geopolitical events make it difficult to predict the corresponding impact on our business. Nevertheless, given the strength of our programs, we are cautiously optimistic and therefore providing a range of sales and EPS expectations for the Fiscal year caveated with the following underlying assumptions. Progressive recovery in the makeup category as full vaccination rates increase and mass wearing abates in western markets during the first half of the Fiscal year. Beginning of the resumption of international travel in the second half of the Fiscal year. The addition of new retail accounts for some of our brands should provide broader access to new consumers, notably through Sephora at Kohl's and Ulta at Target in North America and the addition of JD.com in China online. The inclusion of incremental sales from DECIEM, benefiting sales growth for the fiscal year, primarily in the Americas and AMEA region and in the skincare category. Pricing is expected to add approximately 3 points of growth, helping to offset inflation risk and freight, media, labor, and commodities. Increased advertising support as markets reopen and further investment behind select capabilities, including data analytics, innovation, technology, and sustainability initiatives while maintaining good cost discipline elsewhere. We forecast increasing benefits from our post - COVID business acceleration program as it ramps up this year. Approximately, 200 million of the cost we cut during the pandemic are expected to be reinstated. These primarily include hiring, travel and meeting expenses, furloughs and other leaves of absence, and compensation. In addition to these assumptions, there are a few non-operating items you should be aware of as you adjust your models. Our full-year effective tax rate is expected to return to a more normalized level of approximately 23% from 18.7% in Fiscal 2021. Net interest and investment expense is expected to be around $150 million. The increase is primarily due to the comparison to last year when we recorded the benefits of our minority interest in DECIEM through May 18th 2021. At that time, we acquired a majority ownership in DECIEM and we began to fully consolidate the entire business and deduct a portion of the income we don't own as a charge to net earnings attributable to non-controlling interest. This charge is expected to be less than $5 million in Fiscal 2022. Net cash flows from operating activities are forecast between $3.2 billion. Capital expenditures are planned at approximately 5% of projected Sales. As we develop additional manufacturing and distribution capacity, notably for the building of our new facility in Japan. We also expect to fund more robust research and development capabilities in China and North America. Increased investment in technology and support new distribution and e-commerce for our brands. Our Capex plan for the year also includes some spending differed from last year. Also, beginning in Fiscal 2022, we plan to entry -- introduce the concept of organic sales growth in our earnings materials and investor presentations, organic growth, adjust reported sales growth for both currency and changes in structure, such as acquisitions, divestitures, and brand closures. This should help provide a more meaningful understanding of the performance of our comparable business. Additionally, reflecting the level of volatility still in the environment, we are at this point widening our guidance ranges for the year. For the full fiscal year, organic net sales are forecasted to grow 9% to 12% based on August 13 spot rates of 1.17 for the Euro, 1.381 for the Pound, 1164 for the Korean Won and 6.479 for the Chinese Yuan. We expect currency translation to add one point to reported Sales growth for the full Fiscal year. As I mentioned earlier, this range excludes approximately three points from acquisitions, divestitures and brand closures, primarily, the inclusion of DECIEM theme. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $7.23 and $7.38 before restructuring and other charges. This includes approximately $0.19 of accretion from currency translation. In constant currency, we expect EPS to rise by 9% to 12%. This also includes approximately $0.03 accretion from DECIEM. At this time, we expect organic sales for our first quarter to rise 11% to 13%. The incremental sales from acquisitions, divestitures, and brand closures are expected to add about 3 points to reported growth and currency is expected to be accretive by approximately three points. Operating expenses are expected to rise in the First Quarter as we invest in the reopening and recovery of brick-and-mortar retail around the world and some of the temporary cost measures start to ease. We expect First Quarter EPS of a $1.55 to a $1.65. Currency is expected to be accretive to EPS by $0.05 and DECIEM is forecast to have no impact. In closing, while we're cautious about the uneven recovery to date, we remain confident about the strategic actions we continue to take to support sustainable, profitable growth post-pandemic, and the agility we have demonstrated this past year. On behalf of the entire Estee Lauder Company's leadership team, we give thanks to our incredible teams around the world for their extraordinary efforts to manage during this unprecedented period. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time.\nOperator: The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey, good morning, guys.\nTracey Travis: Hi, Dara.\nFabrizio Freda: Good morning.\nDara Mohsenian: Can you give us an update on how much of the incremental e-commerce business and new customers you obtained during COVID are proving sticky now that we fully cycle COVID and perhaps also just give us a sense for expectations for e-commerce sales, growth in Fiscal '22 and how you sort of think about that versus a COVID boost.  And then longer term, can you also spend some time just discussing how you're better using or upgrading technology to drive e-commerce sales longer-term. Thanks.\nFabrizio Freda: So, let me start is -- first of all, I would say the large majority of our online progress during COVID is very sticky. And keep in mind that we attracted also many new consumer. The new consumer were also among the older consumers, and they really liked it.  And so, we see they're coming back and they're staying, even when store reopens, obviously, with a different balance, but this is definitely happening. But then in total, our online is continuing to grow and we expect this to continue to grow from many years to come and the trend will not stop after COVID.  Also, our online mix, which is 3PP in China for example which as you heard from the prepared remarks, flying the our last 18/6 event was really strong and then retail.com that for many retailers around the world is booming to a play, which is very much growing and then brand.com and obviously brand.com in the moment -- the part of brand.com in the moment that is the bigger reopening and people go back to store will temporarily stabilize or slightly decrease.  But then will start growing again. That's our expectations. So overall, all-in-all our online business will continue to progress as percentage of total business over the next years.\nTracey Travis: And keep in mind Dara. We also explained in our prepared remarks that we do have some new customers. So retailer.com should pick up as well with the U.S. expansion of Ulta into Target and Sephora into Kohl's and the same with JD in China. So again, we've got -- as Fabrizio said, very strong plans for online again, this year.  And -- and I expected that it will -- again increase as a percent of our penetration of Sales. As it relates to technology, we are investing quite a bit in our e-commerce platform to enable capabilities, many of which we have spoken about, whether it's virtual try-on.  Our data analytics that -- that certainly support our being able to more personalized experiences for -- for consumers and many other -- many other capabilities. And beyond -- beyond online where we continue to invest in the consumer experience in our stores and in other areas as well. So we do have a robust technology investment plan that I would expect to continue over the next couple of years.  We're also investing in new technology in our new facility in -- that is opening in a couple of years in Japan. And it will be a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility, so it will leverage quite a bit of technology also.\nDara Mohsenian: Great, thanks.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Olivia Tong with Raymond James.\nOlivia Tong: Great. Thank you. Good morning. I was wondering if you'd talk a little bit more about Asia-Pacific and the improvements there? And if you could talk about the drivers there? You mentioned the strength of 618.  So, should we expect more quarterly variability in Asia, whether because of 618 or 11.11, and how that could influence how the year develops? And then if you could just talk a little bit about the current trends, given another uptake in volatility [Indiscernible] with the pandemic? Thank you.\nFabrizio Freda: There is very -- very big strengths in Asia-Pacifics that we will continue in the long term. Obviously, as we said in the prepared remarks, there has been some pandemic issues and we're down in places like Japan, on some parts to Southeast Asia, which become an obstacle to these. So it's a temporary obstacle to this growth in these specific markets. But, overall, Asia-Pacific will continue to be very strong and will be led by China.  Who's progress will continue to develop in our opinion and also that's what's happening so far. Now, the -- what we call variability of Sales, meaning ups and downs to Sales in Asia-Pacific, particularly in China, Frankly, is more about seasonality.  And there is a clear seasonality like the reason that use like the Visa in Europe and there are holiday moments and Chinese New Year moments, moments where the Chinese population travel, moments in which they are more home, moment where there festivities and there are moments of the year with certain progress, particularly skincare is more used than others. Obviously, there is important elements of seasonality.  Now, the good news we're completely on top of those. We manage seasonality with anticipation. And that's why our quarter-by-quarter a year programs are pretty well, articulate and reconnaissance consumer seasonality and trade proportionality period in a very accurate way at this point of time. So this is a leverage point rather than an issue that's why I would not call it variability, but rather seasonality.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Good morning. I will start with the discussion of 3% contribution from pricing in '22. I know there's always some pricing in the business and it's somewhat subtle based on the consumer standpoint, but 3% just sounded higher than usual to me.  So, curious if it's more centered in categories and brands, are there areas where you just like the momentum is so strong that it's not an untapped opportunity or is this more in response to the broadly inflationary environment?\nTracey Travis: Well, as you mentioned, Lauren, we take pricing every year, usually in the 2% to 2.5% range. We are taking approximately 3% of pricing this year and yes, it is certainly considering the inflationary environment that we're operating in.  We do take differential pricing, so that it is an average across all of our markets, all of our brands. And -- and -- and but -- but so there's no specific category that we're taking any more pricing and -- then others. But -- but it is tiered certainly by the tearing of our -- of our brand Portfolio.\nFabrizio Freda: And I just want to add, we do have the ability to price, where there is the opportunity. And because of our loyalty [Indiscernible] levels, etcetera, obviously in certain markets with spaces. And so we are planning because of the current [Indiscernible] environment, as you said, to take about 0.5 point more prices that in the previous years, and this is completely justified.  And these combined with our cost-saving programs, which should allow us to manage the inflation without any negative impact, neither of our advertising nor on our profitability. And that's our plan. The other thing I want to say about our flexibility on pricing is that with the kind of success we had with innovation, in the kind of very attractiveness of our Innovation that can command luxury pricing very easily because of the great, great quality that we are deploying to the consumers.  And the moment you are between 20%, 30% every year of this coming from innovation, you can imagine that we can decide the pricing of 20%, 30% every year based also on our -- our intent, on the power of our Innovation. So this is a next to our flexibility that we have in terms of managing pricing over the years.\nOperator: And our next question is going to come from the line of Rob Ottenstein with Evercore.\nRobert Ottenstein: Great, thank you very much. Just two questions. If I can just a quick follow-up on the China. We're reading a little bit about government actions in terms of cracking down on wealth-flaunting luxury, particularly in social media. And so I just wanted to be -- make sure that that's not something that you see affecting your business.  And then my deeper question is if you could give us an update on the e-commerce in the U.S. as a percent of sales and how that breaks out between your direct brand.com business and the retailer.com business and any changes in trends there that you're seeing? Thank you.\nFabrizio Freda: And sorry, could you repeat the one on the U.S.?\nTracey Travis: The.com.\nRobert Ottenstein: Just -- just an update on the.com business in the U.S., the percent of Sales, I think it's -- was running 40% and then how that's breaking out between the direct business and the retail.com.\nFabrizio Freda: Okay, starting with China and --\nRobert Ottenstein: No, we don't see any issue on China potential in our industry on our last improvement, what you're saying.\nFabrizio Freda: Actually we see a lot of support to the trend and a lot of interest in our products as the middle class evolves. And we see also given, for example, all the government actions that have been taken to support the development of Hainan and the duty-free line, and there is obviously an interest in supporting internal consumption and somehow, our industry is benefiting from the interest in being the creation of internal consumption and also bringing the consumption in the past was outside more internally.  So, it's all of a positive trend. The other thing, when you speak about luxury, just want to say, we are really affordable actually, in the sense that our products are luxury within the beauty category, but they're very affordable purchases in the context of total luxury.  So, we don't see any negative at this point in time on this front, on the contrary, very strong support for the long-term. Going into the internal online development in the U.S., I'll turn this to Tracey for your specific question on the percentages.\nTracey Travis: Yeah. In terms of the online percentage we ended last year a little over 40% online. Again, as you know, we started the year with some of our Brick-and-mortar doors actually closed. So very, very strong online penetration. And as Brick-and-mortar reopened, the online penetration lessened a bit, but we did end the year at about 40%. In terms of the retailer.com versus brand.com, we are seeing -- and it varies.  So we saw quite a bit of strength in retailer.com towards the second half of the year and strengthen -- and brand.com earlier in the year. And this year, obviously, we have some very strong plans for both brand.com and retailer.com in the U.S. to continue to grow.\nRobert Ottenstein: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Steve Powers, Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: Yes. Thanks and good morning. I was hoping you would just elaborate a bit further on what you're doing to best position your portfolio to take advantage of the anticipated recovery in makeup and to what degree you see your businesses likely to accrue net share gains alongside that recovery? Thank you.\nFabrizio Freda: So we -- we -- we are preparing for the makeup brand source and we are working on all our makeup brands and in all our regions to leverage these as user education comes back. The prove that what was exactly happening in the U.S. in this last Quarter is very encouraging. In the last Quarter, our makeup was extraordinarily strong. For example, in countries where the world's have a recovery growth, like the U.S. and we saw great results from MAC onto phase and to many other brands.  And we saw, particularly, the recovery start s from foundation and lipsticks, which is very good news, a very good sign. So what we're doing is first of all, we are preparing programs, marketing programs, and innovation programs and new launches for every market, making sure that we timed those to the expected recovery trend.  That would be gradual but we will be -- as you know, we'll be dependent on vaccination levels and on the ability to control the COVID spikes where this happens. And so we have all analytics that tell us when this timing could be in different parts of the world. We time our marketing the auction, our advertising relaunch auctions, our innovation auctions to the different expected recovery moments.  So it's a pretty complex elaboration or plan, but it's very effective. And so far has given us the kind of results we wanted, but most importantly, the kind of return on the investment that we wanted when you time it correctly. The second thing that we're doing obviously is making sure that we use data analytics and we use the understanding of the consumers to really tailor it to where the trend will start, and this is set by makeup subcategories.  There are very different priorities that the consumer choose in coming back to makeup when the [Indiscernible]. And so we have some outstanding new capability in analytics that drive us also in maximum effectiveness in these areas.  So, in -- all-in-all, we are very, very encouraged by the early recovery in the countries where this happened, which are mainly U.S., China, and we are well organized to follow up on the recovering gradually in the course of 2022.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Stephanie Wissink with [Indiscernible].\nGrace Ong: Hi, good morning. This is Grace Ong for Steph. I wanted to dig in a little on the Travel retail recovery that you're expecting and how you think about the growth in market locations like Hainan. Would you expect that Hainan continues to grow on international travel resumes or is there a re-balancing where the demand is realized? Thank you.\nFabrizio Freda: Yeah. First of all, we expect Hainan to continue to grow in the future and we expect Hainan success to be relatively independent from the comeback to international travel. Let me explain that; if you put in the number of Chinese consumers that have a passport, which is above 10% evolving towards 15%, from the information which are available and you assume they don't get percentage of those consumer with the past travel internationally in a given year, you immediately see that the international travel is going to create consumption that is a certain percentage of the Chinese population.  Hainan is domestic travel, so is open to 100% of the Chinese middle class that wants to travel and is traveling as we speak. So the Hainan phenomenon is basically -- goes well beyond international travel because it is domestic travel and appeals 100% of the population. That's why we believe that Hainan is here to stay and is a great opportunity for the long-term term that will continue to growth even when international travel will restart.  As far as the international travel question. We are assuming that some international travel will gradually restart in the second semester of our '22 Fiscal year. And these obviously, this is an assumption, nobody knows and will depend not only will from the pandemic development, will depend also from the government decisions on how to manage the various rules around the management of the pandemic.  So is -- we can only go with estimates, but that's what we're currently estimating. And we have seen already signs for example, in summer in Europe, we're seeing some new travel, some new movements and some increase, but obviously relatively still very much below what was before COVID. And then in Fiscal Year 2023, we assume there will be a more robust international travel acceleration.\nOperator: And our next question is going to come from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel.\nMark Astrachan: Thanks and morning everyone. Wanted to ask a bit of a follow-up on China and just maybe talk a bit about what's embedded in your -- your expectations just overall for the business, for that country for Fiscal '22? And it may be in the context of things that we've seen around slowing sales on Tmall and discuss the commentary about expanding on JD and just how does that fit in when you talk about different demographics? So, if you could elaborate a bit on what you're hoping to accomplish that would be helpful? Thank you.\nFabrizio Freda: So we -- we -- we expect the -- the market in China to continue to grow double-digit. And we're very, very optimistic on the strengths of this market, as well as on -- on our position with the consumers in this market. We -- we expect to see a continuous acceleration of online, which is already 50% of Mainland China business today and farther growing.  We see the possibility of continued growth in the existing platforms, like Tmall, which is for us, for beauty, for our brands, very successful and a great partners that we will continue to develop and manage with also specific products of specific brands -- of specific new brands in the future.  And then we see an acceleration of brand.com. And in the marketing models around the brand.com in which we are investing and also improving our technologies to keep it aligned with the extraordinary development of technology in China, and the ability to make this technology very appealing to the consumers.  And so we keep learning and keep evolving in this area. And then there are certain brands that are appealing to certain demographics that also decided to expand [Indiscernible], and just now in July. And so very optimistic with also the results of these increased coverage of consumers that we're getting.  And there would be more opportunity in the future is a very, very dynamic market and competitive market, which keeps evolving and our principal is always to stay ahead of devolution, which admittedly is not easy in such a demanding market. But we're trying to stay always ahead of the evolution and anticipate change.  And we'd get helped in this by our extraordinary Chinese leadership team, that keep us braced around what's happening and help us anticipating all the trends. And we get helped by our compass that we discussed in our time, which gives us a good, good point of view on what will be the evolution in the consumer preferences in every market, but particularly in China.\nOperator: And our next question is going to come from the line of Erinn Murphy with Piper Sandler.\nErinn Murphy: Great. Thanks. Good morning. My question is for Tracey. If you could talk a little bit more about what you expect for the Sales and the profitability of rebound in the North American segment in Fiscal 2022.  Particularly when you're kind of layering on some of the new distribution partnerships, both Kohl's and Sephora and Ulta Target. And then I do have a follow-up Fabrizio on DECIEM. I know that ordinary has been driving the large success to date, but they do have a number of other brands in their Portfolio? So curious on your plans to scale some of them. Thank you.\nTracey Travis: Okay. Let me start with North America. We're very optimistic, given the trends that we saw in the Fourth Quarter and that are continuing into the First Quarter as it relates to North America. So, people are coming back to stores. People are still shopping online and certainly, the new retail partnerships of our retail partners, we are expecting, will also contribute to growth this year.  But across the board, the team has really been working on a terrific innovation. We're increasing advertising in North America in Fiscal 2022, so we expect both top-line growth and margin expansion in North America related to our strategies in 2022.\nFabrizio Freda: And on these, you are absolutely right. DECIEM is a Company with an extraordinary Portfolio brands. The Ordinary is today, the biggest, and is continued to be very successful in growing as an extraordinary brand. But our other brand light [Indiscernible], which is more science-based, that we intend with the DECIEM team to continue to develop.  And also DECIEM is adding twice that of the Company, the capability of an extraordinary incubation, [Indiscernible], and ability. So we definitely intend to continue incubate new brands, develop new ideas, and continue with the days and philosophy of the challenge of the status quo and seeing new different point of views to be offered to the consumers and develop the extraordinary new brands in the long-term.  But in this moment, the opportunity for the ordinary to continue to grow -- to continue to expand is frankly amazing and is obviously the priority we are focusing on in fiscal year 2022.\nErinn Murphy: Thank you so much.\nOperator: And our next question is going to be from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo.\nChris Carey: Hi, thank you very much. I just wanted to follow up on disclosure around travel retail being 29% of Fiscal '21 Sales. Can you just confirm that? And then that would imply that you had a pretty big acceleration in Q4 in the Travel retail business. And then does that mean that the continental Europe business declined in the quarter?  So any -- just any clarification just around that. And then just longer-term this decision to partner with Ulta and Target, support Coles, this is really an expansion of distribution throughout [Indiscernible] some channels where you've been less comfortable going in the past, but there's just more of a -- these brands are being curated in a different setting, what are your thoughts on that in other channels, say Amazon or other online forums over time? So thanks so much for those.\nTracey Travis: So -- so I can confirm Travel retail in terms of the percent of mix at -- at 29% on it -- we did have strong growth and travel retail in the fourth quarter. And in terms of the AMEA region, we did see growth as well in the AMEA region excluding -- excluding Travel retail, the UK was a little challenge. But -- but as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, all our regions grew in the fourth quarter\nFabrizio Freda: And the other thing I want to say on Travel retail on the long term, as I said, is the -- travel retail as these addition of the domestic travel in China, which is a very important additions. And so the development of the business with the Chinese consumers is extraordinary and then the Chinese consumer depending on the period of the year or their choice is some of them would travel to Hainan by there others would buy in the cities, and so you would see these expanding growth of the Chinese consumers in the China region or in the travel retail Hainan depending on what the Chinese consumer decide to do.  Our strategy is very simple. We are going to serve the growing demand of Chinese consumer wherever they choose to shop. And so, we are aligned, we are in the outstanding quality department stores in China, we are in Hainan, and in all these areas, where they shop, we tend to be present with outstanding execution, great luxury, quality of services, and to really give justice to our elevated luxury positioning in these positions.  And that's the strategy to cover the Chinese consumer shopping. And as far as the -- when, when the international traveling will restart, we'll obviously also cover the international travels in the best possible way. In term of your second part of the question is -- I would like to clarify one thing. I think Fiscal Year 2021 was an extraordinary year to build our luxury position and to elevate our consumers pressure in a very luxury way.  If you think that the core investment that we have done is being in elevating the brand building, the luxury experience online. And that we have been able to bring online a lot of the luxury speed and services than the past we're only in the best department stores or in the best Brick-and-mortar locations. So these now means that we have elevated to the best possible experience about 30% of our business.  Then, as I explained, our best expression of luxury is frankly in TR. It's being for a -- since a long time, particularly in the best airports of the world, but now is in Hainan, where there is the best expression of the brands in the world, and as you said, is another 29%. So we have elevated our luxury expression in more than 60% of our business around the world.  And that's the key areas to where we invested. We have also taken the opportunity, where there is the opportunity to source from mass and to continue growing the prestige segment, to bring some of our brands to have the power of sourcing from mass clues to where the mass consumers are choosing to shop and wants to have the opportunity to upgrade to different quality.  And that's where some opportunities like the Ulta Target and Sephora Kohl's offer us the opportunity to further source from mass, and further serve more consumers and consumer that we didn't access before with our best experience at best quality products.\nOperator: Thank you.

            "name": "Fabrizio Freda",
            "content": "Thank you, Rainey and hello everyone. I hope you and your families are in good health. In our hearts, continue to be with those impacted by COVID-19. We delivered outstanding performance amid the pandemic in fiscal year 2021, capped with an exceptional fourth quarter empowered by our dynamic multiple engines of growth strategy, as well as the timeless desirability of prestige beauty. In a year of pain and sorrow, our employees cared for each other, their families, and our Company with compassion, creativity, and results. While the challenges of COVID-19 persist, we confidently begin Fiscal year 2022 as a stronger Company full of aspiration for the opportunities of tomorrow. For Fiscal Year 2021, sales rose 11%, as we pivoted our energy resources to the growth engines of skincare, fragrance, Asia-Pacific, travel retail in Asia-Pacific, and global online. Impressively, 8 brands grew double-digits, led by Estee Lauder, La Mer, and Jo Malone London. Multiple waves and variance of COVID-19 to extend the center reach were unexpected a year ago drove volatility and variability throughout the year. We saw reopening reversed to closing and reopening in one market met with renewed lockdowns in other markets. Despite this, we delivered on the goal we set last August for sales growth to improve sequentially each quarter. Our sales exceeded $16 billion for the first time ever, up 9% from Fiscal year 2019 on a reported basis, fueled by skincare and fragrance. Adjusted Operating margin expanded to 18.9%, which is 140 Basis points above Fiscal year 2019. As we invested in today's strongest growth engines, managed cost with discipline and funded long-term growth opportunities. Adjusted diluted earnings per share rose 21% relative to 2 years ago. We delivered these excellent results while pushing our social impact and sustainability goals and commitment. First and foremost, we remain focused on employee and consumer safety and well-being. We achieved important milestones for our 2025 sustainability goals, expanded our inclusion, diversity and equity programs, defined a strategy for Women's advancement and gender equality and advanced work towards our racial equity commitments. Here are a few among the many areas of our progress. We achieved net-zero carbon emissions and 100% renewable electricity globally, for our own operations. We also set science-based emissions reductions targets, addressing scope 1 and 2 for our direct operation and certain elements of scope 3 for our value chain signaling our new level of ambition for climate options. We launched ingredient [Indiscernible] for seven additional brands, such that 11 brands now offer these insightful content. We transformed our tradition inclusion, diversity and equity week into a blockbuster virtual experience with 35 events involving thousands of participants from 25 countries. We also introduced new educational offerings, including four anti-racist and inclusive leadership. We expanded our gross root to add employee resource groups, which served as a source of support and comfort throughout the turmoil of last year. The women leadership network is our largest group and is now global with it's a expansion into Latin America and Asia-Pacific. We created two new leadership programs for women and Black employees. The open door women's leadership program is a unique, intensive course to develop our next-generation of women leaders. Building on its success, we designed the open doors collection, a self-guided program to bring these leadership skills to all our employees around the world. The [Indiscernible] chair leadership and development program as successfully held to ensure that black employees have equitable access to leadership training's, mentorship, career development, and advancement opportunity, as well as to build a stronger, more inclusive network of talent across the organization by promoting visibility and facilitating leadership connections points with participants. Our new partnership with Howard University focused on its alumina, hosted 12 engaging events and launched an accelerator program to help increase the pipeline for black talent with career, coaching, professional training, and self-empowering networking. Let me now turn to product Innovation, which serve as an impossible catalysts for growth in Fiscal year 2021. Innovation represented over 30% of sales, exceeding our expectations. We combined data analytics with our creative talent and R&D to successfully anticipate, scale and set trends across categories. The Estee Lauder brand achieved its fourth consecutive year of double-digit sales growth in fiscal year 2021, fueled by strength across its many hero franchises in skin care. Trusted products along with innovation were highly sold from Shanghai to New York, Paris, and now Sao Paolo, given the brand's well-received launch in Brazil. Advanced Night Repair newly preformulated serum sparked excellent sales growth. Revitalizing Supremes', New Supreme Bright moisturizer further bolstered the accelerating franchise, while the Nutriv new eye serum served and created a halo effect on demand. In makeup, the brand's double wear, futurist and pure Clorox franchises produced significant double-digit sales growth in the fourth quarter. An exciting early signs of makeup river source. La Mer delivered outstanding double-digit Sales growth in the fiscal year. As innovation sort an engaging campaigns with iconic ingredient base narratives drove demand for its hero products. The new genesence de La Mer concentrated on a bulb proved highly sold after and expanded the brand's ultra-luxury franchise. It is both large count new consumers and captivated, loyal consumers globally. Clinique Skin Care accelerate in fiscal year 2021. Sales rose double digits and powered the brands to high single-digit sales growth. The brand successfully met consumer needs through the launch of Moisture Surge 100H with its unique hydration benefits and target solutions for how to solve skincare problems like Even Better Clinical Interrupter. Clinique showcased its promise for makeup renaissance, with Stellar double-digit category growth in the Fourth Quarter, with the new Even Better Clinical Serum Foundation and Even Better Concealer capitalizing on its skincare authority. All told, our robust skincare Portfolio from entry prestige to luxury in across subcategories, is fulfilling this journey needs around the world [Indiscernible] with its [Indiscernible], brand positioning and Hero products delivered strong double-digit organic sales growth in the second half of Fiscal year 2021. In May, we amplified the strength of our skincare Portfolio as we became majority owner of DECIEM with its coveted ingredient base brand, the ordinary, an emerging science driven neared brand as part of its Portfolio. Complementing skincare strengths, fragrance delivered striking sequential sales growth acceleration throughout the year. Each of our luxury and artisanal fragrance brand contributed meaningfully from Jo Malone, London to Tom Ford Beauty, Le Labo, Kilian Paris and Frederic Malle. In both established fragrance markets of the west and emerging fragrance market of the East, Tom Ford Beauty's Private Blend franchise is both recruiting new consumers and driving stronger tips in marketing newly embracing the category with the brand's dragon Sales more than doubling in Mainland China during the year. The Asia-Pacific region was another dynamic growth engine in Fiscal Year 2021. Its annual sales growth accelerated from 18% to 22%, led by Mainland China where sales rose strong double digits. Korea grew organically. Several smaller markets also contributed to Asia-Pacific strength. The region, however, experienced increasing pressure from the pandemic as the year evolved, with Japan and many markets in Southeast Asia particularly impacted from renewed lockdowns in the second half. Mainland China prospered, as we invested in its vibrancy of today and opportunity of tomorrow. We entered more cities, reaching 145, expanded our presence specialty multi, opened freestanding doors and increased our advertising spending. Skincare fragrance sales grew strong double-digit for the Fiscal year. We are encouraged that the makeup accelerated to double-digit sales growth in the second half, our brands delivered excellent results for the key events of T-Mobile's 1111 global shopping festival and 618 mid-year shopping festival as engaging live streaming generated product discovery for many new consumers. For the recent 618, among Tmall Beauty Flagship Stores, the Estee Lauder brand ranked number 1 in Total Beauty, while La Mer ranked 1st in Luxury Beauty, and Jo Malone London led the fragrance category. To further capture the market recent online growth opportunity, we are continuing to invest in Tmall and brand.com to expand our capabilities. Most recently, some brands increased coverage of a different demographics by launching already in July. With international travel, larger curtailed, we expanded our investment in the dynamic Travel retail development of Hainan highland to serve the Chinese consumers in the best possible way, given the island's tremendous traffic growth in higher duty-free purchase limits. Our brands further elevated the installed and prepaid shopping experiences, delivered ideal merchandising, and leveraged live streaming to drive strong sales growth. Looking at channels, online thrived globally in fiscal year 2021 characterized by strong double-digit sales gains and step change in its power as a growth engine. We accelerated our consumer-facing digital infrastructure and fulfillment investments. The challenge is now more than twice as big as it was two years ago and greatly benefit from its diversification as each of brand.com, third-party platforms, retail.com and [Indiscernible] of retailers delivered outstanding performance. During the year, brand.com came to epitomize their lure of a luxury flack sheet store for each brands localized by market and re-imagined with our classic High-Touch services. We expanded virtual trainer, live-streaming, omnichannel capabilities and consultations with our expert beauty advisors. Consumers are all ages. Explored, replenished and engaged in an immersive environment of entertainment and community. Our brands increasingly leverage the exciting trends in social commerce by integrating with Instagram, WeChat, Snapchat and others. Estee Lauder launched on TikTok with the #NightDoneRight. driving nearly 12 billion views and the creation of almost 2 million videos. It challenge use diverse creators to educate a younger audience on how important is to take care of your skin at night. Showcasing Advanced Night Repair. Clinique, this happens campaigns on TikTok became a viral sensation, highlighting the brand's acne solution, exploring the creation of nearly 700,000 videos on the app. Together, these and other strategic actions delivered exceptional results for brand.com as new consumers, conversion, basket size, repeat, and loyalty members grew considerably. Beyond the favorable growth rates, the data relationship with Frosted with consumers enabled us to better optimize engagement in-store and online, offering exciting future growth opportunities. We are investing across all channels of online, collaborating with traditional and pure-play retailers on initiatives to actualize Prestige Beauty online potential. We spoke on the last call about heading expanded our presence with Tour Player retailers, which continued into the Fourth Quarter, most especially in EMEA. And as I discussed a few minutes ago, we are expanding our consumer coverage in Mainland China. For Fiscal Year 2022, we expect these growth engines of Skincare, Fragrance Asia-Pacific, Travel Retail Asia-Pacific, and Global Online to continue to try, owing to our strong repeat purchase rates, sophisticated data analytics -derived consumer acquisitions, and retention. high-touch online services, and robust innovation pipeline. Three compelling skincare innovation recently launched. Estee Lauder's new advanced night repair eye matrix is focused on lines in every eyed zone, while La Mer De Hydrating Infused Emulsion is designed to replenish, strengthen, stabilize skin with healing moisture and has already proven to attract new consumers. Clinic -- Smart Clinical retail wrinkled correcting Serum is designed to visibly reduced stubborn lines. Our Shanghai Innovation Center is expected to open in the second half of this fiscal year. In reaching our capability in product design, formulation, consumer insight, and trend analytics for Chinese and Asian consumers. Also, with the new center, our East to West innovation will benefit, enabling us to create more successes like Estee Lauder futurist Hydra or Supreme Bright, and La Mer, the treatment lotion. As the world emerged from the pandemic, we will be the best diversified pure-play in prestige beauty as more engines of growth contribute across categories, geographies, and channels. Makeup and hair care are poised to gradually reignite as growth engines. As our developed markets in the West in Brick-and-mortar retail. Growth in emerging markets is expected to resume over time as vaccination rates increase. We anticipate the momentum in makeup will build around the world driven by local reopening, an increasing social and professional user education, just as we saw in the fourth quarter. Indeed, makeups started to improve to the end of Fiscal year 2021, driven by our Hero of sub-categories of foundation and mascara. Newness in the category was highly sold, evidenced by the success of MAC magic extension Mascara to face Lip Plumper, Smashbox hollowed, tinted moisturizers, and Bobbi Brown sheer pressie power contributing to makeup emerging Renaissance, MAC launched MAC The Moment. It campaign linking its makeup products in artistry inspire trends to key experiences such as date night, parties, weddings, and back-to-school shopping Too Faced expanded into brows in July with the collection that includes an innovative brow gel, that adds color and texture. Similar to makeup, hair care is set to benefit from the rise of socially professional use education, as well as saloon reopening. Aveda, which is now 100% vegan and Bumble and bumble enter fiscal year 2022 with momentum owing to desirable innovation and reached consumer engagement for strong online performance globally over the past year. As makeup and hair care vein yard, we expect our engines of growth will gradually diversify by geography and channel, initially driven by developed markets in the west and over time by emerging markets in the U.S., the Fourth Quarter, we aligned innovation, advertised spending and store activations as consumer returned to stores, eager to explore beauty and steer in high-touch services. Across brick-and-mortar from regional and national department stores to specialty [inaudible] and freestanding stores, our business in the U.S. prospered, most especially in makeup and fragrance, and exceeded our expectations. As we start our new fiscal year, Bobbi Brown recently debuted in Ulta Beauty. Several of our brands launched online and in-store with Sephora at Kohl's and Ulta Beauty at Target. In closing. We leverage the power of our multiple engines of growth strategy to elevate the Company to new heights in Fiscal year 2021. We did this while leaving our values with the health and well-being of our employees as primary focus in making post and progress on our social impact commitment and sustainability goals. Our success in agility, in operating and in the challenges of the past year, give us confidence for Fiscal year 2022 as we expect volatility of variability from the pandemic to persist for some time to come. This year, we are celebrating our 75th anniversary as a Company and beginning our next 75 years, incredibly inspired by the opportunities of tomorrow as the leading global house of prestige beauty with the most talented employees, to whom I extend my deepest gratitude. I will now turn the call over to Tracey. Good morning. So, let me start is -- first of all, I would say the large majority of our online progress during COVID is very sticky. And keep in mind that we attracted also many new consumer. The new consumer were also among the older consumers, and they really liked it.  And so, we see they're coming back and they're staying, even when store reopens, obviously, with a different balance, but this is definitely happening. But then in total, our online is continuing to grow and we expect this to continue to grow from many years to come and the trend will not stop after COVID.  Also, our online mix, which is 3PP in China for example which as you heard from the prepared remarks, flying the our last 18/6 event was really strong and then retail.com that for many retailers around the world is booming to a play, which is very much growing and then brand.com and obviously brand.com in the moment -- the part of brand.com in the moment that is the bigger reopening and people go back to store will temporarily stabilize or slightly decrease.  But then will start growing again. That's our expectations. So overall, all-in-all our online business will continue to progress as percentage of total business over the next years. There is very -- very big strengths in Asia-Pacifics that we will continue in the long term. Obviously, as we said in the prepared remarks, there has been some pandemic issues and we're down in places like Japan, on some parts to Southeast Asia, which become an obstacle to these. So it's a temporary obstacle to this growth in these specific markets. But, overall, Asia-Pacific will continue to be very strong and will be led by China.  Who's progress will continue to develop in our opinion and also that's what's happening so far. Now, the -- what we call variability of Sales, meaning ups and downs to Sales in Asia-Pacific, particularly in China, Frankly, is more about seasonality.  And there is a clear seasonality like the reason that use like the Visa in Europe and there are holiday moments and Chinese New Year moments, moments where the Chinese population travel, moments in which they are more home, moment where there festivities and there are moments of the year with certain progress, particularly skincare is more used than others. Obviously, there is important elements of seasonality.  Now, the good news we're completely on top of those. We manage seasonality with anticipation. And that's why our quarter-by-quarter a year programs are pretty well, articulate and reconnaissance consumer seasonality and trade proportionality period in a very accurate way at this point of time. So this is a leverage point rather than an issue that's why I would not call it variability, but rather seasonality. And I just want to add, we do have the ability to price, where there is the opportunity. And because of our loyalty [Indiscernible] levels, etcetera, obviously in certain markets with spaces. And so we are planning because of the current [Indiscernible] environment, as you said, to take about 0.5 point more prices that in the previous years, and this is completely justified.  And these combined with our cost-saving programs, which should allow us to manage the inflation without any negative impact, neither of our advertising nor on our profitability. And that's our plan. The other thing I want to say about our flexibility on pricing is that with the kind of success we had with innovation, in the kind of very attractiveness of our Innovation that can command luxury pricing very easily because of the great, great quality that we are deploying to the consumers.  And the moment you are between 20%, 30% every year of this coming from innovation, you can imagine that we can decide the pricing of 20%, 30% every year based also on our -- our intent, on the power of our Innovation. So this is a next to our flexibility that we have in terms of managing pricing over the years. And sorry, could you repeat the one on the U.S.? Okay, starting with China and -- Actually we see a lot of support to the trend and a lot of interest in our products as the middle class evolves. And we see also given, for example, all the government actions that have been taken to support the development of Hainan and the duty-free line, and there is obviously an interest in supporting internal consumption and somehow, our industry is benefiting from the interest in being the creation of internal consumption and also bringing the consumption in the past was outside more internally.  So, it's all of a positive trend. The other thing, when you speak about luxury, just want to say, we are really affordable actually, in the sense that our products are luxury within the beauty category, but they're very affordable purchases in the context of total luxury.  So, we don't see any negative at this point in time on this front, on the contrary, very strong support for the long-term. Going into the internal online development in the U.S., I'll turn this to Tracey for your specific question on the percentages. So we -- we -- we are preparing for the makeup brand source and we are working on all our makeup brands and in all our regions to leverage these as user education comes back. The prove that what was exactly happening in the U.S. in this last Quarter is very encouraging. In the last Quarter, our makeup was extraordinarily strong. For example, in countries where the world's have a recovery growth, like the U.S. and we saw great results from MAC onto phase and to many other brands.  And we saw, particularly, the recovery start s from foundation and lipsticks, which is very good news, a very good sign. So what we're doing is first of all, we are preparing programs, marketing programs, and innovation programs and new launches for every market, making sure that we timed those to the expected recovery trend.  That would be gradual but we will be -- as you know, we'll be dependent on vaccination levels and on the ability to control the COVID spikes where this happens. And so we have all analytics that tell us when this timing could be in different parts of the world. We time our marketing the auction, our advertising relaunch auctions, our innovation auctions to the different expected recovery moments.  So it's a pretty complex elaboration or plan, but it's very effective. And so far has given us the kind of results we wanted, but most importantly, the kind of return on the investment that we wanted when you time it correctly. The second thing that we're doing obviously is making sure that we use data analytics and we use the understanding of the consumers to really tailor it to where the trend will start, and this is set by makeup subcategories.  There are very different priorities that the consumer choose in coming back to makeup when the [Indiscernible]. And so we have some outstanding new capability in analytics that drive us also in maximum effectiveness in these areas.  So, in -- all-in-all, we are very, very encouraged by the early recovery in the countries where this happened, which are mainly U.S., China, and we are well organized to follow up on the recovering gradually in the course of 2022. Yeah. First of all, we expect Hainan to continue to grow in the future and we expect Hainan success to be relatively independent from the comeback to international travel. Let me explain that; if you put in the number of Chinese consumers that have a passport, which is above 10% evolving towards 15%, from the information which are available and you assume they don't get percentage of those consumer with the past travel internationally in a given year, you immediately see that the international travel is going to create consumption that is a certain percentage of the Chinese population.  Hainan is domestic travel, so is open to 100% of the Chinese middle class that wants to travel and is traveling as we speak. So the Hainan phenomenon is basically -- goes well beyond international travel because it is domestic travel and appeals 100% of the population. That's why we believe that Hainan is here to stay and is a great opportunity for the long-term term that will continue to growth even when international travel will restart.  As far as the international travel question. We are assuming that some international travel will gradually restart in the second semester of our '22 Fiscal year. And these obviously, this is an assumption, nobody knows and will depend not only will from the pandemic development, will depend also from the government decisions on how to manage the various rules around the management of the pandemic.  So is -- we can only go with estimates, but that's what we're currently estimating. And we have seen already signs for example, in summer in Europe, we're seeing some new travel, some new movements and some increase, but obviously relatively still very much below what was before COVID. And then in Fiscal Year 2023, we assume there will be a more robust international travel acceleration. So we -- we -- we expect the -- the market in China to continue to grow double-digit. And we're very, very optimistic on the strengths of this market, as well as on -- on our position with the consumers in this market. We -- we expect to see a continuous acceleration of online, which is already 50% of Mainland China business today and farther growing.  We see the possibility of continued growth in the existing platforms, like Tmall, which is for us, for beauty, for our brands, very successful and a great partners that we will continue to develop and manage with also specific products of specific brands -- of specific new brands in the future.  And then we see an acceleration of brand.com. And in the marketing models around the brand.com in which we are investing and also improving our technologies to keep it aligned with the extraordinary development of technology in China, and the ability to make this technology very appealing to the consumers.  And so we keep learning and keep evolving in this area. And then there are certain brands that are appealing to certain demographics that also decided to expand [Indiscernible], and just now in July. And so very optimistic with also the results of these increased coverage of consumers that we're getting.  And there would be more opportunity in the future is a very, very dynamic market and competitive market, which keeps evolving and our principal is always to stay ahead of devolution, which admittedly is not easy in such a demanding market. But we're trying to stay always ahead of the evolution and anticipate change.  And we'd get helped in this by our extraordinary Chinese leadership team, that keep us braced around what's happening and help us anticipating all the trends. And we get helped by our compass that we discussed in our time, which gives us a good, good point of view on what will be the evolution in the consumer preferences in every market, but particularly in China. And on these, you are absolutely right. DECIEM is a Company with an extraordinary Portfolio brands. The Ordinary is today, the biggest, and is continued to be very successful in growing as an extraordinary brand. But our other brand light [Indiscernible], which is more science-based, that we intend with the DECIEM team to continue to develop.  And also DECIEM is adding twice that of the Company, the capability of an extraordinary incubation, [Indiscernible], and ability. So we definitely intend to continue incubate new brands, develop new ideas, and continue with the days and philosophy of the challenge of the status quo and seeing new different point of views to be offered to the consumers and develop the extraordinary new brands in the long-term.  But in this moment, the opportunity for the ordinary to continue to grow -- to continue to expand is frankly amazing and is obviously the priority we are focusing on in fiscal year 2022. And the other thing I want to say on Travel retail on the long term, as I said, is the -- travel retail as these addition of the domestic travel in China, which is a very important additions. And so the development of the business with the Chinese consumers is extraordinary and then the Chinese consumer depending on the period of the year or their choice is some of them would travel to Hainan by there others would buy in the cities, and so you would see these expanding growth of the Chinese consumers in the China region or in the travel retail Hainan depending on what the Chinese consumer decide to do.  Our strategy is very simple. We are going to serve the growing demand of Chinese consumer wherever they choose to shop. And so, we are aligned, we are in the outstanding quality department stores in China, we are in Hainan, and in all these areas, where they shop, we tend to be present with outstanding execution, great luxury, quality of services, and to really give justice to our elevated luxury positioning in these positions.  And that's the strategy to cover the Chinese consumer shopping. And as far as the -- when, when the international traveling will restart, we'll obviously also cover the international travels in the best possible way. In term of your second part of the question is -- I would like to clarify one thing. I think Fiscal Year 2021 was an extraordinary year to build our luxury position and to elevate our consumers pressure in a very luxury way.  If you think that the core investment that we have done is being in elevating the brand building, the luxury experience online. And that we have been able to bring online a lot of the luxury speed and services than the past we're only in the best department stores or in the best Brick-and-mortar locations. So these now means that we have elevated to the best possible experience about 30% of our business.  Then, as I explained, our best expression of luxury is frankly in TR. It's being for a -- since a long time, particularly in the best airports of the world, but now is in Hainan, where there is the best expression of the brands in the world, and as you said, is another 29%. So we have elevated our luxury expression in more than 60% of our business around the world.  And that's the key areas to where we invested. We have also taken the opportunity, where there is the opportunity to source from mass and to continue growing the prestige segment, to bring some of our brands to have the power of sourcing from mass clues to where the mass consumers are choosing to shop and wants to have the opportunity to upgrade to different quality.  And that's where some opportunities like the Ulta Target and Sephora Kohl's offer us the opportunity to further source from mass, and further serve more consumers and consumer that we didn't access before with our best experience at best quality products."

            "name": "Tracey Travis",
            "content": "Thank you for [Indiscernible] and hello, everyone. I concur with Fabrizio in thanking our incredible team who have demonstrated great resilience during the pandemic. Navigating through the highly uneven recovery this past year has certainly required greater agility and flexibility and our teams across the globe rose to the occasion, delivering superb results for the Fiscal year, while also establishing a stronger foundation for future growth and profitability. We delivered exceptional net sales growth of 56% in our fourth quarter as we anniversary pandemic-related store closures in the prior year. The inclusion of six weeks of sales from DECIEM added approximately three points to growth in the quarter. Our performance also exceeded the pre-pandemic levels of the Fiscal 2019 Fourth Quarter by 9% driven by significant sales increases in Mainland China, the skincare and fragrance categories, global online, and travel retail in Asia. All three regions grew and all product categories within each region grew during the Quarter. Net sales in the Americas region rose 86% against the prior-year period with almost no brick-and-mortar retail open. Throughout the quarter, consumer confidence in the U.S. grew as COVID restrictions abated and people resume shopping in stores again. Our brands responded with strong program supporting recovery, new product launches, and animating key brand shopping events like Mother's Day. Sales in the region remained below Fiscal '19 level for the quarter, reflecting in part the loss of over 900 retail locations that represented nearly 170 million in annual sales. Additionally, makeup has historically been the largest category in the region, and the category has yet to fully recouped sales loss during the pandemic. Nevertheless, we are encouraged by the sequential acceleration in North American sales, which has been better than we expected. Net Sales in our Europe, the Middle East, and Africa region increased 65% with all markets contributing to growth as COVID restrictions eased throughout the Quarter. Global Travel Retail, which is primarily reported in this region, continued to suffer from a significant drop in international travel traffic, but grew strong double-digits in the Quarter as comparisons eased and local tourism in China, especially to Hainan remained robust. Across developed markets in the region, store traffic has begun to pick up and retailers have become more comfortable with restocking. Emerging markets in the region saw strong retail in the Quarter, driven by locally relevant holiday activation, retailer events, and online performance. Sales in the region were slightly above Fiscal '19 levels for the Quarter, primarily due to the resilience of travel retail. Net sales in the Asia-Pacific region rose 30%. Virtually every country contributed to growth, although the pace of improvement varied widely among the markets and a resurgence of COVID has slowed a full recovery. Sales of our products online continued to rise strong double-digit in the region driven by the successful 618 Shopping Festival campaign in China and including the continued strength of social e-commerce. Mainland China continued to experience robust double-digit growth with broad-based improvement across product categories, brands and channels. Other markets in the region, including Korea, Hong Kong and Japan grew exceptionally against prior year Brick-and-mortar lockdown. Sales in the region were 50% above 2019 levels, largely reflecting China's rapid emergence from the pandemic last year. Net sales in all product categories grew sharply this quarter. And skin care, fragrance and hair care drove higher sales than Fiscal 2019. Fragrance-led growth with net sales rising 150% versus prior-year. Luxury fragrances resonated with consumers looking for self-care and indulgence and among Chinese consumers, increasingly attracted to the category. Home, bath, and body products have also gained traction during the pandemic and helped to attract new consumers. Jo Malone London saw recovery to pre-pandemic levels in Brick-and-mortar. And the brands Blossom and Brit collections were popular in Asia. Standouts from Tom Ford Beauty include the recent launch of Tubereuse Nue and the continued strength of Bitter Peach and Rose Prick. Net sales in makeup jumped 70% against the prior year that reflected the greatest beauty category impact of COVID-19, particularly in western markets, where makeup is the largest category. The makeup category in prestige beauty has proven to be especially sensitive to brick-and-mortar recovery due to the use of testers and in-store services by consumers. Estee Lauder saw strong growth of Futurist and Double Wear foundations in Asia, and MAC liquid lip colour and eye products, especially mascara, outperformed. Haircare net sales grew 52% as salons and stores reopened. The launch of Aveda's Blonde Revival Shampoo and Conditioner also contributed to category growth. Adding to other strong innovation programs over the past several months from Aveda. Net sales in skincare continued to thrive. They rose 42% in the quarter driven by strong increases from the La Mer Estee Lauder, Clinique and [Indiscernible] with its brands, particularly in Asia. Skincare sales growth also benefited from the addition of DECIEM in the quarter by approximately 4% points. Our Gross margin improved 650 Basis points compared to the fourth quarter last year. This favorability reflected significant improvements in obsolescence and manufacturing efficiencies compared to the prior year impact of COVID-19 on our Sales and on our manufacturing locations. Operating expenses rose 36% driven by the planned increase in advertising and selling costs to support the reopening of retail and the recovery. Additionally, we sharply curtailed spending last year in response to the onset of the pandemic and some of these costs were reinstated, primarily compensation. We delivered operating income of 385 million for the Quarter compared to a $228 million operating loss in the prior-year quarter. Diluted earnings per share of $0.78 included $0.02 of favorable currency translation and $0.02 dilution from the acquisition of DECIEM. Our full-year results reflect the benefits of our strategic focus as we leaned into current growth drivers and invested behind future areas of growth, while effectively managing both costs and cash. The sequential acceleration of our business throughout the year culminated in net sales growth of 11%. The strength of Chinese consumer demand, both at home and in travel retail, the resilience of the skincare and fragrance categories, and the momentum we drove in our online channels, all supported our growth. Our distribution mix continued to revolve even as Brick-and-mortar reopened. Sales of our products through all online channels continued to thrive as they rose 34% for the year and represented 28% of Sales. Despite the continued curtailment of international travel, our business in the Travel retail channel grew ending Fiscal 2021 at 29% of Sales. Among Brick-and-mortar retail, specialty multi and perfumeries grew while department stores and freestanding stores experienced the greatest impact from the ongoing pandemic and declined for the year. Our Gross margin rose 120 Basis points to 76.4% driven by favorable pricing, lower obsolescence, increased manufacturing efficiencies and lower costs for testers and stores and partially offset by currency due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar. Operating expenses declined 300 Basis points to 57.5% of sales. Selling and store operating costs decreased as high service stores were either closed for part of the year or they reopened with reduced traffic and staffing levels. Additionally, in-store merchandising costs decreased while advertising investments, primarily Digital media, rose faster than Sales to support our brands in the recovery. We achieved significant savings from our cost initiatives, including Leading Beauty Forward and the preliminary benefits from the Post-COVID Business Acceleration Program. And this gave us the flexibility to reinvest in necessary capabilities, absorbed some of the inflation and media and logistics costs, as well as support the reinstatement of certain compensation elements that were reduced or frozen due to the onset of the pandemic. Our full-year Operating margin was 18.9%. representing a 420 basis-point improvement over last year and 140 basis points above Fiscal 2019. This year also includes 50 basis points of dilution from the inclusion of Dr. Jart and DECIEM. Our effective tax rate for the year was 18.7%, a decrease of 450 basis points over the prior year, primarily driven by the geographic mix of earnings, which included a favorable one-time adjustment for Fiscal Years 2019 and 2020 related to recently issued GILTI Tax Regulation s. Net earnings rose 57% to $2.4 billion and diluted EPS increased 57% to $6.45. Earnings per share includes $0.11 accretion from currency translation and $0.08 dilution from the acquisitions of Dr. Jart and DECIEM. In Fiscal 2021, we recorded 148 million after-tax or $0.40 per share of impairment charges related to our Smashbox and GLAMGLOW brands, as well as certain freestanding retail stores. Restructuring and other charges related primarily to the Post-COVID Business Acceleration Program, were 176 million after-tax or $0.48 per share. These charges were more than offset by the one-time gain on our minority interest in DECIEM of 847 million after-tax or $2.30 per share. The Post-COVID Business Acceleration Program is progressing quickly with projects underway across all regions. We have closed nearly 500 doors or counters, including about 50 freestanding stores under the program in Fiscal 2021. We also closed approximately 100 additional freestanding stores outside of the program and upon lease expiration, primarily in North America and in Europe. We've realigned our go-to-market organizations to better reflect our evolving channel mix. We're also winding down certain brands such as BECCA and Rodan. These actions are expected to continue into Fiscal 2022. For the total program, we continue to expect to take charges of between 400 million and 500 million through Fiscal 2022 and generate savings of 300 to 400 million before tax by Fiscal 2023, a portion of which will be reinvested. We continue to focus on maintaining strong liquidity while also investing for future growth during the year. Cash generated from operations rose 59% to $3.6 billion were primarily reflecting the higher net earnings. We utilized 637 million for Capital improvements, supporting increased capacity and other supply chain improvements, further e-commerce development and information technology. We repaid 750 million of Debt outstanding from our revolving credit facility, issued 600 million of new long-term Debt and retired 450 million of Debt. We used 1.1 billion net of cash acquired to increase our ownership interest in DECIEM. And we returned 1.5 billion in cash to Stakeholders during the year via increased Dividends and the reinstatement of share repurchase activities in the second half of the Fiscal year. So looking ahead to Fiscal 2022, we are encouraged by the increasing vaccination rates and reopening of markets around the world. We look forward to the resumption of international travel, increasing foot traffic and Brick-and-mortar retail and the development of our recent acquisitions. We are still mindful, however, that the recovery has evolved unevenly and some markets are seeing their third or fourth waves of COVID, including increasing effects of new more contagious strains of the virus, hindering a return to normal life. This has been particularly evident in the U.S. over the past several weeks. Additionally, increasing climate and geopolitical events make it difficult to predict the corresponding impact on our business. Nevertheless, given the strength of our programs, we are cautiously optimistic and therefore providing a range of sales and EPS expectations for the Fiscal year caveated with the following underlying assumptions. Progressive recovery in the makeup category as full vaccination rates increase and mass wearing abates in western markets during the first half of the Fiscal year. Beginning of the resumption of international travel in the second half of the Fiscal year. The addition of new retail accounts for some of our brands should provide broader access to new consumers, notably through Sephora at Kohl's and Ulta at Target in North America and the addition of JD.com in China online. The inclusion of incremental sales from DECIEM, benefiting sales growth for the fiscal year, primarily in the Americas and AMEA region and in the skincare category. Pricing is expected to add approximately 3 points of growth, helping to offset inflation risk and freight, media, labor, and commodities. Increased advertising support as markets reopen and further investment behind select capabilities, including data analytics, innovation, technology, and sustainability initiatives while maintaining good cost discipline elsewhere. We forecast increasing benefits from our post - COVID business acceleration program as it ramps up this year. Approximately, 200 million of the cost we cut during the pandemic are expected to be reinstated. These primarily include hiring, travel and meeting expenses, furloughs and other leaves of absence, and compensation. In addition to these assumptions, there are a few non-operating items you should be aware of as you adjust your models. Our full-year effective tax rate is expected to return to a more normalized level of approximately 23% from 18.7% in Fiscal 2021. Net interest and investment expense is expected to be around $150 million. The increase is primarily due to the comparison to last year when we recorded the benefits of our minority interest in DECIEM through May 18th 2021. At that time, we acquired a majority ownership in DECIEM and we began to fully consolidate the entire business and deduct a portion of the income we don't own as a charge to net earnings attributable to non-controlling interest. This charge is expected to be less than $5 million in Fiscal 2022. Net cash flows from operating activities are forecast between $3.2 billion. Capital expenditures are planned at approximately 5% of projected Sales. As we develop additional manufacturing and distribution capacity, notably for the building of our new facility in Japan. We also expect to fund more robust research and development capabilities in China and North America. Increased investment in technology and support new distribution and e-commerce for our brands. Our Capex plan for the year also includes some spending differed from last year. Also, beginning in Fiscal 2022, we plan to entry -- introduce the concept of organic sales growth in our earnings materials and investor presentations, organic growth, adjust reported sales growth for both currency and changes in structure, such as acquisitions, divestitures, and brand closures. This should help provide a more meaningful understanding of the performance of our comparable business. Additionally, reflecting the level of volatility still in the environment, we are at this point widening our guidance ranges for the year. For the full fiscal year, organic net sales are forecasted to grow 9% to 12% based on August 13 spot rates of 1.17 for the Euro, 1.381 for the Pound, 1164 for the Korean Won and 6.479 for the Chinese Yuan. We expect currency translation to add one point to reported Sales growth for the full Fiscal year. As I mentioned earlier, this range excludes approximately three points from acquisitions, divestitures and brand closures, primarily, the inclusion of DECIEM theme. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $7.23 and $7.38 before restructuring and other charges. This includes approximately $0.19 of accretion from currency translation. In constant currency, we expect EPS to rise by 9% to 12%. This also includes approximately $0.03 accretion from DECIEM. At this time, we expect organic sales for our first quarter to rise 11% to 13%. The incremental sales from acquisitions, divestitures, and brand closures are expected to add about 3 points to reported growth and currency is expected to be accretive by approximately three points. Operating expenses are expected to rise in the First Quarter as we invest in the reopening and recovery of brick-and-mortar retail around the world and some of the temporary cost measures start to ease. We expect First Quarter EPS of a $1.55 to a $1.65. Currency is expected to be accretive to EPS by $0.05 and DECIEM is forecast to have no impact. In closing, while we're cautious about the uneven recovery to date, we remain confident about the strategic actions we continue to take to support sustainable, profitable growth post-pandemic, and the agility we have demonstrated this past year. On behalf of the entire Estee Lauder Company's leadership team, we give thanks to our incredible teams around the world for their extraordinary efforts to manage during this unprecedented period. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time. Hi, Dara. And keep in mind Dara. We also explained in our prepared remarks that we do have some new customers. So retailer.com should pick up as well with the U.S. expansion of Ulta into Target and Sephora into Kohl's and the same with JD in China. So again, we've got -- as Fabrizio said, very strong plans for online again, this year.  And -- and I expected that it will -- again increase as a percent of our penetration of Sales. As it relates to technology, we are investing quite a bit in our e-commerce platform to enable capabilities, many of which we have spoken about, whether it's virtual try-on.  Our data analytics that -- that certainly support our being able to more personalized experiences for -- for consumers and many other -- many other capabilities. And beyond -- beyond online where we continue to invest in the consumer experience in our stores and in other areas as well. So we do have a robust technology investment plan that I would expect to continue over the next couple of years.  We're also investing in new technology in our new facility in -- that is opening in a couple of years in Japan. And it will be a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility, so it will leverage quite a bit of technology also. Well, as you mentioned, Lauren, we take pricing every year, usually in the 2% to 2.5% range. We are taking approximately 3% of pricing this year and yes, it is certainly considering the inflationary environment that we're operating in.  We do take differential pricing, so that it is an average across all of our markets, all of our brands. And -- and -- and but -- but so there's no specific category that we're taking any more pricing and -- then others. But -- but it is tiered certainly by the tearing of our -- of our brand Portfolio. The.com. Yeah. In terms of the online percentage we ended last year a little over 40% online. Again, as you know, we started the year with some of our Brick-and-mortar doors actually closed. So very, very strong online penetration. And as Brick-and-mortar reopened, the online penetration lessened a bit, but we did end the year at about 40%. In terms of the retailer.com versus brand.com, we are seeing -- and it varies.  So we saw quite a bit of strength in retailer.com towards the second half of the year and strengthen -- and brand.com earlier in the year. And this year, obviously, we have some very strong plans for both brand.com and retailer.com in the U.S. to continue to grow. Okay. Let me start with North America. We're very optimistic, given the trends that we saw in the Fourth Quarter and that are continuing into the First Quarter as it relates to North America. So, people are coming back to stores. People are still shopping online and certainly, the new retail partnerships of our retail partners, we are expecting, will also contribute to growth this year.  But across the board, the team has really been working on a terrific innovation. We're increasing advertising in North America in Fiscal 2022, so we expect both top-line growth and margin expansion in North America related to our strategies in 2022. So -- so I can confirm Travel retail in terms of the percent of mix at -- at 29% on it -- we did have strong growth and travel retail in the fourth quarter. And in terms of the AMEA region, we did see growth as well in the AMEA region excluding -- excluding Travel retail, the UK was a little challenge. But -- but as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, all our regions grew in the fourth quarter"

        "content": "Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to The Est\u00e9e Lauder Company's Fiscal 2021 Third Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded and webcast. For opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Rainey Mancini. Please go ahead.\nRainey Mancini: Hello. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges and adjustments disclosed in our press release. Unless otherwise stated, all net sales growth numbers are in constant currency and all organic results exclude the impacts of acquisitions. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our press release and on the Investors section of our website. As a reminder, references to online sales include sales we make directly to our consumers through our Brand.com site and through third-party platforms. It also includes estimated sales of our products through our retailer\u2019s websites. During the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question so we can respond to all of you within the time scheduled for this call. And now I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio.\nFabrizio Freda: Thank you, Rainey and hello, everyone. It's a pleasure to speak with you today. And I hope that you and your families are in good health. Our hearts are with those impacted by COVID-19, particularly in places like India and Brazil, that are experiencing severe resurgences. We remain committed to doing what we can to support our employees and these communities. Our third quarter of the fiscal year 2021 marks the continuation of strong sequential sales growth improvements, despite the ongoing challenges from the pandemic. We exceeded our sales and earnings growth expectation, even as several markets experienced increasing COVID-19 pressure throughout the quarter. Our multiple engines of growth strategy drove our success, empowered by the exceptional creativity and passion of our employees. We achieved these outstanding results while acting on our values. First and foremost, we continued to invest in employees and consumer safety and well being during the health crisis. We expanded our work for the environment from setting innovative new sustainability goals in travel retail to seeing a wind farm in Oklahoma became fully operational, which is our largest renewable energy concept to date, and a project we were proud to support. We made progress on our racial equity commitments, and also outlined a new set of commitments for women advanced in gender equality, inclusive of achieving gender pay equity and globally increased representation of women from underrepresented groups. In March, we launched our new Equity and Engagement Center of Excellence, to drive greater equity representation within our business and across the value chain. We also launched the partnership with Howard University to support the success of its alumnae to our experiential learning, career coaching, professional training, and mentorship opportunities. While there was joy in this progress, there was also sorrow. We stood with our employees, consumers and partners in denouncing the rise in acts of violence, hate and discrimination against the Asia and Pacific Islander community, and committed to donate to organizations that support justice and equal treatment from Asian community in the United States. We keep our employees and communities top of mind through these challenging times. With that as our guiding principle, let me turn back to financial results. Constant currency sales rose 13%, representing a substantial acceleration of organic sales growth improvement. We delivered strong performance despite increased COVID-19 hardship in Western Europe, Latin America and parts of North America during the quarter. Est\u00e9e Lauder, La Mer, Jo Malone London, Clinique and Tone for Beauty lead the impressive performance of many brands. Skin care and fragrance once again delivered superior sales growth, although they had the toughest comparison to the year-ago period. In fact, our skin care category was nearly 30% larger on a reported basis this quarter than it was 2 years ago, owing to innovation in our powerful Hero franchises, strength across multiple subcategories and the addition of Dr Jart, but before the future inclusion updation. In our fragrance category, it was 16% bigger than it was in fiscal year 2019 on a reported basis, driven by our strategic focus on the luxury and our seasonal segments. Both of these categories now have even greater scale to capture prestige beauty share as the recovery unfolds. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2021, we focused our investment decisions on engines of growth and employed cost discipline in other areas, resulting in a near doubling of adjusted diluted earnings per share versus the prior year period. While the complexities of the pandemic are ever present, adjusted operating margin nonetheless exceeded that of the third quarter of fiscal year '19. And adjusted diluted earnings per share was 5% higher. Throughout the pandemic, we have been steadfast in our commitment to the long-term, as we successfully navigate the short-term. We continue to strategically invest to drive sustainable growth, including building an end-to-end Innovation Center in Shanghai, and state-of-the-art manufacturing facility near Tokyo. These are expected to open in calendar year 2022. More recently, several of our brands decided to participate in the new partnership of Sephora with Kohl's recalls and Ulta beauty with Target, beginning in the second half of this calendar year. This new consumer coverage represents the promising evolution of the retail landscape both in store and online in the United States for prestige beauty. We also agreed to increase our ownership in DECIEM, becoming majority investors with the path to full ownership in 3 years. DECIEM with its fast growing brand, the ordinary and new brands incubation capability aligns well with our multiple engines of growth strategy. The ordinary further #diversifies our skin care growth engine by consumer segments, price point and geography with a superior online business. The brand has redefined entry prestige with an increased ingredient focused regimen based product portfolio that drives basket size. The Ordinary has quickly established itself as a top 5 skin care brand in the U.S prestige beauty having improved its rank significantly over the last year. Sustainability is integral to DECIEM equity, products and retail practices, which will announce our sustainability brand portfolio and fuel the achievement of our ESG strategy and goals. We look forward to continue the exciting journey with Nicola Kilner and her incredibly talented team to realize DECIEM global opportunity. In the third quarter, the Est\u00e9e Lauder brands delivered stellar results led by strong double-digit growth in skin care, sequentially improving trends in makeup and the return to growth in fragrance. The brand is driving a renewal in the skinification on makeup trend with a significant growth of its Futurist franchise and its new Beautiful Magnolia fragrance is off to a very promising start. The Est\u00e9e Lauder skin care franchises performed exceptionally well led by Advanced Night Repair and its recently reformulated namesake serum. Revitalizing Supreme also was a standout as the launch of Supreme Bright, proved highly sought. Supreme Bright is an amazing story of east to west success. With the product born in the brightening trend in Asia, and realizing global appeals for its uneven skin tone benefits. Re-Nutriv, new eye serum surged and created a halo effect for the franchise phase in eye creams. La Mer performance was once again outstanding. The brand's worldwide success is multifaceted from both loyal and new consumers and with increase in demand from men who now represent more than 15% of sales in mainland China. La Mer's iconic product, rich storytelling, and ideal merchandising, aligned to deliver the successful journey to renewal campaign for Chinese New Year as well the brand executed a superb global campaign focused on moisturizers. The new Genaissance de La Mer, the concentrated night balm continue to spark consumer desires elevating the brand ultra luxury franchise. Clinique sales growth accelerated sequentially and rose in every region driven by its skin care portfolio. From consumers' excellent response to the new Moisture Surge in the United States to even better Clinique interrupter fueling substantial growth in mainland China to in-demand Hero franchises like Dramatically Different Moisturizing, Clinique prospered. Our luxury and our seasonal fragrances realized significant growth in the Americas and Asia Pacific. Like skin care, fragrance offer a means to express self care and that showed through the emotional comfort of scent. We are seeing strong repeat from the emerging category in Asia Pacific. While we continue to welcome new consumers in the region. This trends in fragrance is driven by our strategic shift to the higher end is favorable to margin announcement in the category. Jo Malone London, Tom Ford Beauty, Kilian Paris, Le Labo and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle each grew double digits. Innovation and Hero products work in harmony to fulfill consumer desires with newness from Jo Malone London and Tom Ford Beauty incredibly well received. Kilian Paris, virtual selling, which engaged founder Kilian Hennessy, influencers, and education ambassadors through live chat and shoppable live streams contributed to superb online growth. Each region grew this quarter, led by Asia Pacific, which saw sales rise in every category and many countries contributed. Mainland China was exceptional, delivering sequentially accelerated double-digit sales growth with skin care and fragrance performing ahead of the previous quarter and makeup returning to growth at double digits. Both brick-and-mortar and online thrived, driven by the strong equity of our brands, desirable innovation, high quality product leading to repeat purchase, competitive investment in advertising and investment in local talent and capabilities. For the Chinese New Year, we met the consumer where she or he chose to shop, serving the local consumer as well, the travelling consumer in Hainan, both in-store and retail to tremendous success. Online continue to be a powerful growth engine. As global sales increased strong double digits in every region. Sales of brand.com, third-party platforms and retail.com rose strong double digits, while sales of pure play grew triple-digit as we are building our consumer coverage with select pure play retailers. Our online channel is now nearly double the size it was two years ago. Importantly, the media value of brand.com continue to rise as live chat, virtual try-on and live streaming led to increased traffic and time spent on our sites. EMEA online sales increased near triple digits, while Latin America's growth was also very high. We adaptively met consumer demand in these regions, which were more pressure than others from temporary brick-and-mortar closures. In Asia Pacific and North America, where installed traffic is gradually improving in comparisons to the prior year are increasingly more difficult, online sales still grew double digits. We are innovating in the high touch online consumer experience and harnessing our data to increase engagement and drive sales. Let me share two examples from EMEA. In the United Kingdom, Clinique launched an integrated platform to deliver seamless end-to-end high touch virtual experiences with a personalized data led version of its Skin School on demand. Clinique is providing consultants with data to unlock more sophisticated recommendation with a multitude of tools to ensure the consumer experience is customized based on preferences. Consultants can now enable co-browsing and the adding of friends to services. This new platform, while still in its early days, is delivering above average conversion rates. La Mer enhanced its digital experiences with more expert classes and one-to-one consultations tailored to local consumers. The brand expanded live chat to every market in the region with a standard hours and additional days leading to incredible growth in conversion. All told, La Mer saw its regional online mix of business surge. Our brands are investing for growth with social media platform. Too Faced introduced a new virtual try-on lens on Snapchat to add to its growing portfolio of virtual try-on experiences. On TikTok, it launched a mini movie showcasing the transformative experience of Better Than Sex Mascara via its first world premiere on the platform. Dr. Jart appears color correcting treatment, targets strong online sales in the United States for the brand amplified by social selling TikTok and influencer support. Looking ahead, we are preparing a renaissance in makeup. And we anticipate that momentum will gradually build around the world, driven by local reopening and social and professional occasions. Our data and insights are driving new creativity to aspire consumers as they increase their occasion based makeup. We are strategically well-positioned to grow our sales and capture prestige beauty share in makeup recovery with our Hero products, robust innovation pipeline, analytics engine driving aspirational intelligence, an enticing in-store and online activations centered on the omni-channel consumer. Already in the third quarter newness from Clinique even better franchise in foundation and concealer was highly sought as we saw consumer restocking their core makeup products. Too Faced new Lip Plumper was a major hit. Hero products like Tom Ford Beauty eyeshadows, a mascara from Too Faced, the Bobbi Brown also performed very well. MAC is launching a new mascara, and there is exciting innovation from many brands to come. In closing, we deliver outstanding performance despite the resurging impact of the pandemic in many countries. We lead with our values as we continue to priorities the safety and well-being of our employees and consumers. We made progress on our environmental goals and acted on our social committed. We invested in accelerating drivers for sustainable growth, including innovation in China, manufacturing in Asia Pacific, global online and consumer analytics. For the long-term, we are confident that our multiple engines of growth strategy will continue to create value for our stockholders. I want to say thank you to our employees who are integral to our success in making us a better company through this difficult moment. We are beautifully positioned in prestige beauty to continue drive in recovery with the house of the most dedicated and talented employees. I will now turn the call over to Tracy.\nTracey Travis: Thank you, Fabrizio. I certainly echo that statement and look forward to the continued progression of our recovery. For our fiscal third quarter, net sales rose 13% as we left the onset of the COVID pandemic, and delivered exceptional growth in the Asia Pacific region and in the skin care and fragrance categories. While our brick-and-mortar distribution continue to experience soft foot traffic, our online channel delivered strong growth across all formats and all regions. Conversely, the environments in Western Europe, Latin America and parts of North America were challenged throughout the quarter. Our gross margin increased 90 basis points compared to the prior year quarter favorability and category and channel mix driven by skin care and online growth, as well as lower tester costs were partially offset by obsolescence, negative currency and COVID related under recovery of fixed cost primarily in our facilities that manufacture makeup products. Operating expenses improved by 530 basis points compared to the prior year quarter, largely reflecting the improved sales leverage this year. You will recall that when the pandemic struck in the prior year quarter, the sudden and dramatic drop in sales created expense deleverage that was difficult to fully offset despite the cost actions we took at that time. This quarter, we benefited from both temporary and longer term cost savings, which is reflected in the substantially lower selling and store operating costs as a percent of sales continued to shift from brick-and-mortar to online as sales continued to shift from brick-and-mortar to online. This was due in part to temporary store closures in response to a resurgence of the virus in certain EMEA and Latin American markets. We realize some subsidies and the extension of furlough benefits in some of the affected markets. We've also prudently managed staffing levels in our stores, and new hires on our management teams, until we see the recovery gaining more consistent momentum. Advertising spending grew double digits, and was predominantly focused on digital spending. We invested to support our online acceleration as well as our new product launches, a strong recovery in certain markets and key shopping moments such as Lunar New Year, Women's Day and Valentine's Day. As a result, our operating margin rose 620 basis points to 20.5%, which was 40 basis points above fiscal '19 level. Our effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 20.7%. The lower tax rate for the quarter was primarily due to a lower rate on the company's foreign operations. Diluted EPS of $1.62 increased 92% compared to the prior year. EPS exceeded our expectations primarily due to the higher sales, continued cost management and a lower effective tax rate. Our plans under the post-COVID business acceleration program are progressing. Year-to-date, we have taken actions in three main areas to adjust our distribution footprint in Latin America and EMEA including travel retail, to exit global distribution of BECCA products, and to realign resources and capabilities, including employee related costs between our brick-and-mortar and online channels. We are already beginning to realize the modest benefits from these actions. As the program continues, we expect to further rationalize our brick-and-mortar retail footprint, primarily in Western markets. For the 9 months, we generated $2.78 billion in net cash flows from operating activities, which was substantially above the prior year, primarily due to higher net earnings as well as working capital improvements. We invested $386 million in capital expenditures to support key investment areas like production and distribution capacity and technology, including our online business. Conversely, we spent far less on counters and stores. We ended the period with approximately $6.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents, including cash from $600 million and senior notes issued in March to support the increased equity investment in DECIEM, once the deal was finalized. We also reinstated our share buyback program in March and utilized $316 million of cash to repurchase our stock and we paid $561 million in dividends. After the end of the quarter, we used $450 million in cash to pay down debt maturing in the fourth quarter. Given our strong cash generation this year, we still remain in a very strong position to pursue further growth opportunities after these actions. So now, let's turn to our outlook. We continue to be encouraged by the sequential improvement we have seen in our business throughout the fiscal year. And we are optimistic that restrictions and hesitancy on travel and social activities will begin to ease in certain markets as vaccine coverage steadily increases. In China, Australia, and Israel, which are at the leading edge of recovery, we are seeing higher makeup sales with usage occasions increasing as social and professional engagements gradually normalize. For example, sales in our freestanding stores in Israel have returned to pre-pandemic level and even lipstick sales are almost back to normal. The upcoming addition of the DECIEM brands to our portfolio and the expansion of our business with Sephora and Ulta beauty in the U.S. represent additional growth drivers for us as we progress in recovery from the pandemic shock, giving us further cause for optimism. We have led with our strengths, our values and our amazing team and have proactively addressed areas where which we could control while at the same time ensuring we are protecting our strategic growth areas. As a result, in the context of a very challenging environment in fiscal 2021, we expect to end the year with sales growth of between 9% and 10% in constant currency. Currency translation is expected to add approximately 2 percentage points to reported growth, reflecting rates of 1.18 for the Euro, 1.33 for the pound and 6.64 for the Yuan. 6 months of incremental sales from the December 2019 acquisition of Dr. Jart, and approximately 1 month expected from DECIEM are contributing approximately 2 percentage points to our expectations of growth for the year. Mindful of the more gradual resumption of traffic to our brick-and-mortar distribution, we kept tight control over costs this year to protect investments needed for long-term growth. Some of the costs we cut temporarily will gradually return as more doors open, subsidies will correspondingly diminish and we plan to meaningfully ramp up advertising spending in our fourth quarter as consumers return to social and professional engagements. That said, we expect to end this fiscal year with an operating margin of approximately 18.5%, an improvement of roughly 100 basis points above fiscal 2019. Full year EPS is expected to be between $6.05 and $6.15, before restructuring and other charges. This reflects approximately $0.10 accretion from currency translation and $0.04 dilution from acquisitions. Our fourth quarter sales are expected to rise between 44% and 50% in constant currency. This reflects both the recovery in many parts of the world as well as an easier comparison against the prior year period most impacted by the pandemic. Currency is expected to be accretive by approximately 4 percentage points and the addition of approximately 1 month of sales from DECIEM would contribute less than 2 percentage points to sales growth. Fourth quarter EPS is expected to be between $0.38 and $0.48, reflecting the sales outlook and increased investments to support the ramp up of our innovate -- innovation and manufacturing capabilities in Asia. Continued investment to drive our online business and the advertising and promotion to support recovery, with a resulting operating margin more typical of our pre-pandemic levels of mid to high single-digit in the quarter. Currency is expected to add $0.02 to EPS, and the addition of DECIEM is immaterial for the quarter, given the short timeframe in purchase accounting. In closing, we are pleased with our performance in the third quarter in the context of a challenging macro backdrop. Our skin care and fragrance brands have proven to be resilient during this time, as consumers shifted online and we enhanced the digital experience with increased services on our sites. As we navigate through the final months of our fiscal year, we are investing in both the near-term recovery and the drivers of long-term sustainable growth that create value for our multiple stakeholders. While it is difficult to predict the growth of global prestige beauty in the near-term, we are confident as we have demonstrated that we can nimbly allocate resources to continue to operate with agility and gain share as the recovery gives way to the new normal. That concludes our prepared remarks and we'll be happy to take your questions at this time.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Great, thanks. Good morning.\nFabrizio Freda: Good morning.\nLauren Lieberman: Good morning. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about Asia Pacific because as strong as trends are, on a 2-year basis, things were a little bit slower this quarter. I know the fiscal second quarter you have 11.11 that's probably a much bigger shopping holiday than Chinese New Year. But from the aggregate level that we see in Asia, things were probably a little bit slower than people expected. So could you just give us a little bit more color there, describing maybe trends in China -- Mainland China, I should say versus whether it was Hong Kong, Japan, other areas where things might have slowed down. And also any other thoughts on Hainan and the degree to which shopping there may be overlapping with things that purchases that used to happen in other Asian markets as Chinese were travelling more overseas are now maybe repatriating those purchases to Hainan? Thanks.\nFabrizio Freda: Yes, sure. Let me start and then Tracey will -- perspective. The -- first of all, we believe China is super strong. I mean, we have accelerated decisively. Our reported number is 63% growth, which is almost double last quarter. So China mainland is very, very strong. Now these numbers include Dr. Jart which is a -- also a strong growing brand in Asia and now is part of our portfolio. So all good. Now, your question on Hainan, Hainan was also strong and continues to grow. And as we say, we really look and manage the Chinese consumer. So we sell to the Chinese consumers where they -- when they travel to Hainan we sell to them in their travel. And when they are in their cities, we sell to them in their cities. The opportunity of continue serving the growing middle class and the multiple smaller cities which are becoming very important for consumption from which the demand is growing continuous.  And we are serving this multiple growth, meaning also there's more cities, the Tier 3, Tier 4 and the different consumer groups. We are serving these both in mainland and in Hainan when the travel in a very positive way. So China is very strong, and in our opinion will continue a very strong trend. The other thing that we seen, which is important to us in China is the recovery of makeup, because China is ahead of other regions in the control of COVID and so in people going back with more confidence to shopping also in brick-and-mortar. And we see the positive impact on that -- on the cap, which I said in my prepared remarks grew double digits. And this obviously is encouraging for what today recovery will represent also in the West as the brick-and-mortar sales go back into the new normal. The other part of your question was about Asia in total. And, yes, Hong Kong is obviously smaller than what used to be and the recovery is lower. And so Hong Kong is getting better, but it's been resized at least for the time being to what used to be. So still is a drag versus the historical levels. And Japan was definitely hit by a new wave. And there was new closures and a lot of government activity to limit shopping in brick-and-mortar any way to limit the social life activity, which means again, very big impact on makeup. And Korea, on the contrary, start the recovery, had a better quarter, and Australia had definitely a better quarter. By the way Australia is another place where its visible the recovery of makeup because of the reopening of the brick-and-mortar and more social life. So Asia was a very mixed bag. In summary, very strong China, very strong Hainan, a better Korea, a better Australia, New Zealand, and still very hard hit some of the emerging markets, Japan and Hong Kong.\nTracey Travis: And you covered it, Fabrizio.\nFabrizio Freda: Okay.\nOperator: Your next question is from Erinn Murphy with Piper Sandler.\nErinn Murphy: Great, thanks. Good morning. Fabrizio, I was hoping you could share a little bit more about the renaissance of makeup you spoke to in China in particular. How is the consumer interacting with the category there? Are there new trends that they're starting to embrace? And then are they sticking with virtual try-on and some of the new ways of shopping like social selling or live streaming, and -- or do you anticipate testers or samples coming back? Just curious on some of the behavior behind that category there.\nFabrizio Freda: Well, first of all, what we see is that the recovery on makeup is particularly -- benefits particularly of the recovery of brick-and-mortar omni-channel shopping because people does like to interact with the products and like the experience of shopping together. And so this is really one driver. And so in China, we see this getting stronger and as the recovery unleash. What we see in terms of product, that people -- and again, I speak about China where these active at all. Australia and Israel is another place where we see signs of what happens during the recovery. And the signs are consistent by the way. And first of all, people go back to their core makeup also because they have not used it for some time and may not be fresh anymore in some cases. So, there is a lot of back to foundation, to lipstick, to mascaras that needs to be purchased back. And now depending which region of the world, a different proportion of these subcategories as you know. But this is back to core. But there is also a huge interest in newness, is obviously that from an emotional standpoint people don't want to go back to the past. They want a new normal. They want to forget actually this very difficult year when they\u2019re in a recovery mode and go back to a new future. So they look for newness, for novelty. And that's why in our renaissance plan, we are both planning in every region of the world where and when this recovery will happen. We are ready to bring back our core and allow the consumer to reload what is their core habits, the core products. And at the same time, an outstanding mix of new product innovation, breakthrough idea, fresh way to use makeup, new looks, and most importantly, looks which are consistent with the renaissance of the user educations because to be clear, makeup is not only about shopping -- emotional shopping. It's about having the occasions in your social life, your professional life to use makeup. And so we are studying how those occasions come back and which kind of makeup core and newness is of interest for each occasions. And the occasion are different by region. And so with this level of analytics, we are preparing what we call the renaissance, which is a comeback, that is very specific. And our ability today to manage these with precisions and avoid excessive pool show, avoiding the wrong subcategories focus. In other words, ensuring a good return of our investments during the recovery. Our ability to do that has dramatically increased, thanks to analytics, which are not only giving us more data to understand what's happening but is giving us more data to anticipate what is going to happen, and that's what we are working on.\nErinn Murphy: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.\nNik Modi: Hi. Good morning, everyone.\nFabrizio Freda: Good morning.\nNik Modi: Good morning. I wanted to ask about the recent new hire for the online President that you've brought in from the outside. I mean, obviously, the online business for you has done incredibly well over the last 10-plus years. And so just wanted to get your thoughts on kind of what the priorities will be for new leadership, especially given that they do have outside perspective on both CPG and retail? Thanks.\nFabrizio Freda: Yes, sure. First of all, Gibu is now in -- since some months and is an exceptional new lead -- new hire and a leader, well integrated by now in our organization. He will bring our online business to next level. As you said, we have done well for many years, but he is here to bring it to a completely new level. And so the priority is, first of all, to continue our growth and leverage this huge acceleration in every single channel, in brand.com, in third parties, in pure plays, in retail.com and in making sure that we have the circulation of the best practices around the world, that we learn from what's happening in every angle in -- of the world, both in our business and in what competition or retailers are doing, the third-party are doing. But I would say the center of all this is to add more technology in order to make the consumer experience in each one of these touch points really, really high quality and even more competitive. So the focus is on taking the consumer experience to the next level. You heard me speaking in the past about chats, virtual try-on, live streaming, and many other experiences that are possible but need to become better and better over time and surprise the consumer for positive. And if we do that correctly, we will continue to drive traffic to our online because we will attract traffic, not only because of our great brands, of our great innovation, but also because of our outstanding services online and because of the experience online that will be frictionless. And also, we will need to make sure that this happens in a very efficient way and in a way which is driven by technology and become consistent across the world so that we can scale it very fast every single time this is going to be needed. And finally, we -- also, one of the priorities is to make digital advertising, and particularly, all the advertise linked to eCommerce more efficient and more effective. And with these to continue to push conversion that will be one of the key challenges and the key opportunities of the next year's in the world of online.\nOperator: Your next question is from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey, guys.\nFabrizio Freda: Hello.\nDara Mohsenian: Just given the unique nature of the COVID crisis, can you just give us a bit of an update on your expectations for the travel retail category going forward? How quickly do you think demand comes back? How do you manage the business for the pace of recovery, but also potential volatility? I just love a bit of an update there. Thanks.\nFabrizio Freda: Yes. Our -- again, Tracey, I will let you add any perspective. But anyway, our travel retail business is up. And so is -- I would say that the recovery will be in net extra versus what is already growth. So what's happened in this field, as you all know, is that the domestic travel in general and particularly within China has been more than offsetting the lack of international travel all over the world and particularly in the west. And so in this moment, we expect the strengths that today in travel retail, in domestic travel in China with Hainan and with new centers like Shenzhen, the Greater Bay and other opportunities which are emerging over time, we expect this to continue and to remain very, very solid. But then at certain moment when international travel will be restated, then we expect international travel to bring net extra opportunities, particularly in the west where there will be obviously many more populations going back to travel. And when this will happen, we envision travel retail to be even stronger than what used to be historically and definitely stronger than today which is mainly driven by only the domestic travel part. So strong reality today, a strong future for travel retail. Now travel retail is about traffic, which what I was commenting on now, speaking about the future recovery in international travel. But it's also true about conversion, which is the percentage of travelers that buy something. So we have seen recently the conversion going up, driven by pretail. So the ability to buy online when you travel. Now, pretail is accelerating in Asia, is a very -- it's already about one-third of the business in many parts of Asia and is not yet very present or very significant in the west. So we see in the future pretail to continue to grow and to be a significant part on travel retail. And with the growth of pretail, we see the opportunity of increased growth or conversion. And in that sense, the -- these -- the traffic coming back plus conversion of travelers into buyers continue to progress, those two KPIs will represent a very solid future for travel retail.\nTracey Travis: And the only thing I would add, Dara, to what Fabrizio said, we are obviously watching traffic patterns and travel patterns pretty closely. Our travel retail team is -- so international travel is really projected at this point in time not to recover until perhaps even the second half of fiscal '20 -- our fiscal '22. So again, we're watching it closely obviously. If it will recover sooner, the travel retail business internationally in terms of consumption would pick up correspondingly. But in the meantime, the travel retail team has done a fantastic job of making sure that we are managing the Western travel retail markets prudently in terms of investments until we see the recovery of traffic and consumption in the Western markets. And the only thing I -- the other thing I would say is that travel retail and online combined now are a little more than half of our total business. And so when you think about our growth momentum going forward and the recovery -- the strength that we see in online and the recovery of travel retail it bodes very well for our future growth.\nDara Mohsenian: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question is from Jason English with Goldman Sachs.\nJason English: Hey, good morning, folks. Thank you for slotting me in.\nFabrizio Freda: Good morning.\nTracey Travis: Good morning, Jason.\nJason English: I guess I want to -- good morning. I want to come back to, I guess, the first question where growth was a bit slower than many of us expected. And one thing that surprised me was just the sequential drop. I know that 2Q is always bigger than 3Q, but the drop down from 2Q to 3Q in terms of revenue was larger than is typical, pretty much across every region but especially Asia Pacific. So in fact one or two questions. One, was last quarter maybe a bit inflated with some retailers once again stepping back into the market reloading inventory? Or are we seeing more of a setback? I mean, I know you talked about some markets tightening down, but generally from where we sit and look globally, it looks like the world is slowly reopening and obviously not all consistent -- consistently. So help me contextualize around my head around why we would see the sequential debt?\nTracey Travis: Yes. I mean, I will start, Jason. I think that what we're seeing more and more in the business particularly in Asia Pacific is more seasonality of the business. So Q2, as you indicate has become a very large quarter for us. It always was a large quarter with holiday. But with the addition of 11.11 and tremendous growth of that holiday year-over-year, we're seeing a very large sales number in our second quarter. In the third quarter, as Fabrizio mentioned, China had a very strong third quarter. We did have some large markets in Asia that were a bit softer, Japan. And I think through this pandemic, we are going to see ups and downs until things really more sustainably get back to normal when vaccine rates obviously accelerate a bit. So I would not read anything long-term into it other than this is still part of the pandemic in terms of seeing up and down performance in various markets. Similarly in terms of EMEA as well, obviously, outside of travel retail, but the Western markets in EMEA were also quite challenged in the quarter as well. So that we expect to see until, again, we see more stabilization and normalization from the pandemic.\nFabrizio Freda: Yes. And so frankly, I just want to underline what Tracey said. I will read in this more of a strong Q2, particularly driven by an extraordinary 11.11 where some of our brands were topped in the 11.11 project and by the fact that holidays were a moment also in the West. They were pretty positive. People were possible, they were allowed, went back to shopping, some brick-and-mortar were open. And then, maybe because these holidays where in some places were open to early, then there was a lot of closures immediately after that, Japan, U.K. Italy, part of North America, Canada. So we've got an enormous amount of closures in the January, March period, in the West particularly, and Japan, obviously. And so that's the combination. The combination is the pandemic impact on brick-and-mortar. Now, keep in mind that as you have seen in the results, we have extraordinary skin care and fragrance, and [indiscernible] brand is doing really strong. The question is the makeup recovery, and the makeup is very linked to the comeback of the brick-and-mortar experience. So all the closures that happened actually after the holidays in many Western markets and in Japan did have an impact on makeup. And we have seen that. So I would not say there is any long-term sign in this Q3. Actually, it is an extraordinarily strong Q3. By the way, it was ahead of our guidance because we had seen that in our guidance. We had seen these kinds of things that would have happened because of the closures. And so it was a very strong quarter and Q2 was just an extraordinary quarter. But as Tracey said, Q2 will be pretty strong because in the future there will be always a combination of holidays and a strong peak of commercial activities like 11.11 and more that we create a high in terms of an absolute level of sales.\nTracey Travis: Operator, next question?\nOperator: Your next question is from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.\nRupesh Parikh: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, Fabrizio, I guess getting going back to your comments of, skin care and fragrance have now exceeded FY '19 levels. So I was curious, as you look at makeup going forward, do you see any structural impediments in your business to get back to where makeup was pre-pandemic from a sales perspective?\nFabrizio Freda: No, no, I would definitely not. I think we are counting on it, again, as the COVID abates and the opening. As I've said before, I want to repeat that, makeup is about user education. So -- and the user education on makeup at exactly the social and professional occasions that when there are closures or when the pandemic is very active and not there and so consumption goes down. So we are really -- we don't see any reason why we would not go back to first stabilization and then growth in makeup when these social occasions come back and these professional occasion comebacks. Just want to take the opportunity to make the pictures. Today, we have our current drivers, which are the Chinese consumer, the global online, and the skin care category and now the high-end fragrance category that will continue to drive. There is no discussion. These areas have been accelerated by COVID. But in reality, their trends were strong already before, so COVID does accelerated, and we are really ready and as you see we are having great success on these drivers even in the middle of COVID. Now, there are new drivers that should be added to these drivers as COVID will abate. Makeup usage, as I said, brick-and-mortar productivity in most markets, certain markets and consumer groups like U.S., U.K., Japan, continental Europe, emerging markets today are unfortunately really badly hit by COVID. We come back, and we gradually come back as the COVID improves. Younger consumer consumption, which is especially linked to makeup will come back. And the TR [ph] outside of Hainan as we said before and pretail acceleration will come back. So there are all these new drivers that we need to accelerate in the next 18 months assuming that will be the pace of return from COVID gradually. Then there are new strengths that we have built during COVID and we have invested in them. There is better innovation in Asia with the center in Shanghai and the quality of our innovation that is creating higher repeat process rates. There is more skin care and more makeup skinification and we have more production capacity of high quality production capacity in our upcoming factory in Tokyo; better consumer understanding and better ability to anticipate trends driven by our investment in analytics; more resources for advertising, especially digital advertising, which is increasing; better high touch services online, as I explained before when there was a question on online; brand portfolio, which is becoming stronger with the acquisition of DECIEM and Dr. Jart; a huge investment and acceleration in every ESG activity during COVID. And all of these combined is what I call the new strengths that we are bringing to the [indiscernible]. So the way we see it is that the current drivers will drive, the new drivers including makeup will come back and the new strengths that we have built in Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies during this year will hit. And that's why we really believe that this quarter is just the confirmation that we are creating a very solid long-term sustainable growth pattern for the company.\nRupesh Parikh: Okay, great.\nTracey Travis: And the only thing I would add to that is, just to underscore some of the investment in technology we've made for virtual try-on. So when you think about those social and professional occasions coming back, whether someone wants to come in the store and try makeup or if they want to try it online, the engagement that we see online from some of the capabilities and features that we've added to online certainly bodes very well for when those occasions come back and the makeup category acceleration.\nRupesh Parikh: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: We have time for one more question. Your final question will come from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo.\nChris Carey: Hi. Good morning, everyone. So I wonder if you can just provide some comments on how you're thinking about that operating margin for fiscal '21, which I think you said was 18.4%, but correct me if I got that wrong. I mean, you noted this quarter that they're temporary but also longer term cost saving is substantially lower. Operating costs in store with the shift online, there are some subsidies in play, but you're also reallocating costs for the longer term for brick-and-mortar to online, channel mix is obviously going to be a dynamic going forward. And I guess, underlying the question is that margins continue to come through at a much higher level, channel mix is clearly an element but there are some costs that have come out permanently but also costs that are going to be coming back into the base. And so, I guess getting back to it, I wonder how you view this fiscal '21 target? Do you think that you can move up from there with all the initiatives that they have noted, or would you expect some sort of a step back as you weather some of these costs coming back into the base and channel mix evolving over the next year? Thanks so much.\nTracey Travis: Yes. So, Chris, as you know we typically give forward guidance for the upcoming fiscal year in August, which we will certainly do. I mean this has been an unusual year because of all of the things that you've mentioned. We had part of the year where we had temporary salary reductions, we've had furloughs and we've also done a fantastic job, our teams have, in terms of managing costs. Some of those costs will come back next year and some of them won't. Some of the door closures that we've permanently done, those costs and the remaining fleet of doors should be more productive as traffic continues to accelerate to brick-and-mortar, which is where we see the bulk of the recovery. So given the cost actions that we've taken, given where we expect growth to come from next year disproportionately, we would expect continued margin progression. But we will be able to say more specifically what that will be in the August timeframe. But as we've said for many years, our growth areas are all margin accretive when you think about travel retail, when you think about online when you think about the strength that we've had over multiple years in terms of skin care. And as Fabrizio said, we expect skin care and fragrance to continue to grow and makeup will also grow more strongly certainly next year as those occasions come back. So we've got multiple engines, multiple ways to progress margin even as investments do come back for brick-and-mortar and in other areas. We will, in the fourth quarter as you indicate, and as I said in my prepared remarks, so -- strongly invest as we normally do for a start of a strong fiscal year and we will invest more in advertising to support what we believe will be an acceleration. It's selectively in the markets that we think that it will happen in.\nChris Carey: Thanks so much for the perspective.\nOperator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn it over to management for closing remarks.\nTracey Travis: Just thank everybody for obviously their interest in the company. And again, I think we want to thank all of our teams for the fantastic performance navigating through what has been a difficult year, but we are incredibly proud, as I mentioned and Fabrizio mentioned of our results. And certainly, we look forward to closing the year strong with the guidance that we provided. So thank you, everyone.\nOperator: Thank you.

            "name": "Fabrizio Freda",
            "content": "Thank you, Rainey and hello, everyone. It's a pleasure to speak with you today. And I hope that you and your families are in good health. Our hearts are with those impacted by COVID-19, particularly in places like India and Brazil, that are experiencing severe resurgences. We remain committed to doing what we can to support our employees and these communities. Our third quarter of the fiscal year 2021 marks the continuation of strong sequential sales growth improvements, despite the ongoing challenges from the pandemic. We exceeded our sales and earnings growth expectation, even as several markets experienced increasing COVID-19 pressure throughout the quarter. Our multiple engines of growth strategy drove our success, empowered by the exceptional creativity and passion of our employees. We achieved these outstanding results while acting on our values. First and foremost, we continued to invest in employees and consumer safety and well being during the health crisis. We expanded our work for the environment from setting innovative new sustainability goals in travel retail to seeing a wind farm in Oklahoma became fully operational, which is our largest renewable energy concept to date, and a project we were proud to support. We made progress on our racial equity commitments, and also outlined a new set of commitments for women advanced in gender equality, inclusive of achieving gender pay equity and globally increased representation of women from underrepresented groups. In March, we launched our new Equity and Engagement Center of Excellence, to drive greater equity representation within our business and across the value chain. We also launched the partnership with Howard University to support the success of its alumnae to our experiential learning, career coaching, professional training, and mentorship opportunities. While there was joy in this progress, there was also sorrow. We stood with our employees, consumers and partners in denouncing the rise in acts of violence, hate and discrimination against the Asia and Pacific Islander community, and committed to donate to organizations that support justice and equal treatment from Asian community in the United States. We keep our employees and communities top of mind through these challenging times. With that as our guiding principle, let me turn back to financial results. Constant currency sales rose 13%, representing a substantial acceleration of organic sales growth improvement. We delivered strong performance despite increased COVID-19 hardship in Western Europe, Latin America and parts of North America during the quarter. Este\u0301e Lauder, La Mer, Jo Malone London, Clinique and Tone for Beauty lead the impressive performance of many brands. Skin care and fragrance once again delivered superior sales growth, although they had the toughest comparison to the year-ago period. In fact, our skin care category was nearly 30% larger on a reported basis this quarter than it was 2 years ago, owing to innovation in our powerful Hero franchises, strength across multiple subcategories and the addition of Dr Jart, but before the future inclusion updation. In our fragrance category, it was 16% bigger than it was in fiscal year 2019 on a reported basis, driven by our strategic focus on the luxury and our seasonal segments. Both of these categories now have even greater scale to capture prestige beauty share as the recovery unfolds. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2021, we focused our investment decisions on engines of growth and employed cost discipline in other areas, resulting in a near doubling of adjusted diluted earnings per share versus the prior year period. While the complexities of the pandemic are ever present, adjusted operating margin nonetheless exceeded that of the third quarter of fiscal year '19. And adjusted diluted earnings per share was 5% higher. Throughout the pandemic, we have been steadfast in our commitment to the long-term, as we successfully navigate the short-term. We continue to strategically invest to drive sustainable growth, including building an end-to-end Innovation Center in Shanghai, and state-of-the-art manufacturing facility near Tokyo. These are expected to open in calendar year 2022. More recently, several of our brands decided to participate in the new partnership of Sephora with Kohl's recalls and Ulta beauty with Target, beginning in the second half of this calendar year. This new consumer coverage represents the promising evolution of the retail landscape both in store and online in the United States for prestige beauty. We also agreed to increase our ownership in DECIEM, becoming majority investors with the path to full ownership in 3 years. DECIEM with its fast growing brand, the ordinary and new brands incubation capability aligns well with our multiple engines of growth strategy. The ordinary further #diversifies our skin care growth engine by consumer segments, price point and geography with a superior online business. The brand has redefined entry prestige with an increased ingredient focused regimen based product portfolio that drives basket size. The Ordinary has quickly established itself as a top 5 skin care brand in the U.S prestige beauty having improved its rank significantly over the last year. Sustainability is integral to DECIEM equity, products and retail practices, which will announce our sustainability brand portfolio and fuel the achievement of our ESG strategy and goals. We look forward to continue the exciting journey with Nicola Kilner and her incredibly talented team to realize DECIEM global opportunity. In the third quarter, the Este\u0301e Lauder brands delivered stellar results led by strong double-digit growth in skin care, sequentially improving trends in makeup and the return to growth in fragrance. The brand is driving a renewal in the skinification on makeup trend with a significant growth of its Futurist franchise and its new Beautiful Magnolia fragrance is off to a very promising start. The Este\u0301e Lauder skin care franchises performed exceptionally well led by Advanced Night Repair and its recently reformulated namesake serum. Revitalizing Supreme also was a standout as the launch of Supreme Bright, proved highly sought. Supreme Bright is an amazing story of east to west success. With the product born in the brightening trend in Asia, and realizing global appeals for its uneven skin tone benefits. Re-Nutriv, new eye serum surged and created a halo effect for the franchise phase in eye creams. La Mer performance was once again outstanding. The brand's worldwide success is multifaceted from both loyal and new consumers and with increase in demand from men who now represent more than 15% of sales in mainland China. La Mer's iconic product, rich storytelling, and ideal merchandising, aligned to deliver the successful journey to renewal campaign for Chinese New Year as well the brand executed a superb global campaign focused on moisturizers. The new Genaissance de La Mer, the concentrated night balm continue to spark consumer desires elevating the brand ultra luxury franchise. Clinique sales growth accelerated sequentially and rose in every region driven by its skin care portfolio. From consumers' excellent response to the new Moisture Surge in the United States to even better Clinique interrupter fueling substantial growth in mainland China to in-demand Hero franchises like Dramatically Different Moisturizing, Clinique prospered. Our luxury and our seasonal fragrances realized significant growth in the Americas and Asia Pacific. Like skin care, fragrance offer a means to express self care and that showed through the emotional comfort of scent. We are seeing strong repeat from the emerging category in Asia Pacific. While we continue to welcome new consumers in the region. This trends in fragrance is driven by our strategic shift to the higher end is favorable to margin announcement in the category. Jo Malone London, Tom Ford Beauty, Kilian Paris, Le Labo and Fre\u0301de\u0301ric Malle each grew double digits. Innovation and Hero products work in harmony to fulfill consumer desires with newness from Jo Malone London and Tom Ford Beauty incredibly well received. Kilian Paris, virtual selling, which engaged founder Kilian Hennessy, influencers, and education ambassadors through live chat and shoppable live streams contributed to superb online growth. Each region grew this quarter, led by Asia Pacific, which saw sales rise in every category and many countries contributed. Mainland China was exceptional, delivering sequentially accelerated double-digit sales growth with skin care and fragrance performing ahead of the previous quarter and makeup returning to growth at double digits. Both brick-and-mortar and online thrived, driven by the strong equity of our brands, desirable innovation, high quality product leading to repeat purchase, competitive investment in advertising and investment in local talent and capabilities. For the Chinese New Year, we met the consumer where she or he chose to shop, serving the local consumer as well, the travelling consumer in Hainan, both in-store and retail to tremendous success. Online continue to be a powerful growth engine. As global sales increased strong double digits in every region. Sales of brand.com, third-party platforms and retail.com rose strong double digits, while sales of pure play grew triple-digit as we are building our consumer coverage with select pure play retailers. Our online channel is now nearly double the size it was two years ago. Importantly, the media value of brand.com continue to rise as live chat, virtual try-on and live streaming led to increased traffic and time spent on our sites. EMEA online sales increased near triple digits, while Latin America's growth was also very high. We adaptively met consumer demand in these regions, which were more pressure than others from temporary brick-and-mortar closures. In Asia Pacific and North America, where installed traffic is gradually improving in comparisons to the prior year are increasingly more difficult, online sales still grew double digits. We are innovating in the high touch online consumer experience and harnessing our data to increase engagement and drive sales. Let me share two examples from EMEA. In the United Kingdom, Clinique launched an integrated platform to deliver seamless end-to-end high touch virtual experiences with a personalized data led version of its Skin School on demand. Clinique is providing consultants with data to unlock more sophisticated recommendation with a multitude of tools to ensure the consumer experience is customized based on preferences. Consultants can now enable co-browsing and the adding of friends to services. This new platform, while still in its early days, is delivering above average conversion rates. La Mer enhanced its digital experiences with more expert classes and one-to-one consultations tailored to local consumers. The brand expanded live chat to every market in the region with a standard hours and additional days leading to incredible growth in conversion. All told, La Mer saw its regional online mix of business surge. Our brands are investing for growth with social media platform. Too Faced introduced a new virtual try-on lens on Snapchat to add to its growing portfolio of virtual try-on experiences. On TikTok, it launched a mini movie showcasing the transformative experience of Better Than Sex Mascara via its first world premiere on the platform. Dr. Jart appears color correcting treatment, targets strong online sales in the United States for the brand amplified by social selling TikTok and influencer support. Looking ahead, we are preparing a renaissance in makeup. And we anticipate that momentum will gradually build around the world, driven by local reopening and social and professional occasions. Our data and insights are driving new creativity to aspire consumers as they increase their occasion based makeup. We are strategically well-positioned to grow our sales and capture prestige beauty share in makeup recovery with our Hero products, robust innovation pipeline, analytics engine driving aspirational intelligence, an enticing in-store and online activations centered on the omni-channel consumer. Already in the third quarter newness from Clinique even better franchise in foundation and concealer was highly sought as we saw consumer restocking their core makeup products. Too Faced new Lip Plumper was a major hit. Hero products like Tom Ford Beauty eyeshadows, a mascara from Too Faced, the Bobbi Brown also performed very well. MAC is launching a new mascara, and there is exciting innovation from many brands to come. In closing, we deliver outstanding performance despite the resurging impact of the pandemic in many countries. We lead with our values as we continue to priorities the safety and well-being of our employees and consumers. We made progress on our environmental goals and acted on our social committed. We invested in accelerating drivers for sustainable growth, including innovation in China, manufacturing in Asia Pacific, global online and consumer analytics. For the long-term, we are confident that our multiple engines of growth strategy will continue to create value for our stockholders. I want to say thank you to our employees who are integral to our success in making us a better company through this difficult moment. We are beautifully positioned in prestige beauty to continue drive in recovery with the house of the most dedicated and talented employees. I will now turn the call over to Tracy. Good morning. Yes, sure. Let me start and then Tracey will -- perspective. The -- first of all, we believe China is super strong. I mean, we have accelerated decisively. Our reported number is 63% growth, which is almost double last quarter. So China mainland is very, very strong. Now these numbers include Dr. Jart which is a -- also a strong growing brand in Asia and now is part of our portfolio. So all good. Now, your question on Hainan, Hainan was also strong and continues to grow. And as we say, we really look and manage the Chinese consumer. So we sell to the Chinese consumers where they -- when they travel to Hainan we sell to them in their travel. And when they are in their cities, we sell to them in their cities. The opportunity of continue serving the growing middle class and the multiple smaller cities which are becoming very important for consumption from which the demand is growing continuous.  And we are serving this multiple growth, meaning also there's more cities, the Tier 3, Tier 4 and the different consumer groups. We are serving these both in mainland and in Hainan when the travel in a very positive way. So China is very strong, and in our opinion will continue a very strong trend. The other thing that we seen, which is important to us in China is the recovery of makeup, because China is ahead of other regions in the control of COVID and so in people going back with more confidence to shopping also in brick-and-mortar. And we see the positive impact on that -- on the cap, which I said in my prepared remarks grew double digits. And this obviously is encouraging for what today recovery will represent also in the West as the brick-and-mortar sales go back into the new normal. The other part of your question was about Asia in total. And, yes, Hong Kong is obviously smaller than what used to be and the recovery is lower. And so Hong Kong is getting better, but it's been resized at least for the time being to what used to be. So still is a drag versus the historical levels. And Japan was definitely hit by a new wave. And there was new closures and a lot of government activity to limit shopping in brick-and-mortar any way to limit the social life activity, which means again, very big impact on makeup. And Korea, on the contrary, start the recovery, had a better quarter, and Australia had definitely a better quarter. By the way Australia is another place where its visible the recovery of makeup because of the reopening of the brick-and-mortar and more social life. So Asia was a very mixed bag. In summary, very strong China, very strong Hainan, a better Korea, a better Australia, New Zealand, and still very hard hit some of the emerging markets, Japan and Hong Kong. Okay. Well, first of all, what we see is that the recovery on makeup is particularly -- benefits particularly of the recovery of brick-and-mortar omni-channel shopping because people does like to interact with the products and like the experience of shopping together. And so this is really one driver. And so in China, we see this getting stronger and as the recovery unleash. What we see in terms of product, that people -- and again, I speak about China where these active at all. Australia and Israel is another place where we see signs of what happens during the recovery. And the signs are consistent by the way. And first of all, people go back to their core makeup also because they have not used it for some time and may not be fresh anymore in some cases. So, there is a lot of back to foundation, to lipstick, to mascaras that needs to be purchased back. And now depending which region of the world, a different proportion of these subcategories as you know. But this is back to core. But there is also a huge interest in newness, is obviously that from an emotional standpoint people don't want to go back to the past. They want a new normal. They want to forget actually this very difficult year when they're in a recovery mode and go back to a new future. So they look for newness, for novelty. And that's why in our renaissance plan, we are both planning in every region of the world where and when this recovery will happen. We are ready to bring back our core and allow the consumer to reload what is their core habits, the core products. And at the same time, an outstanding mix of new product innovation, breakthrough idea, fresh way to use makeup, new looks, and most importantly, looks which are consistent with the renaissance of the user educations because to be clear, makeup is not only about shopping -- emotional shopping. It's about having the occasions in your social life, your professional life to use makeup. And so we are studying how those occasions come back and which kind of makeup core and newness is of interest for each occasions. And the occasion are different by region. And so with this level of analytics, we are preparing what we call the renaissance, which is a comeback, that is very specific. And our ability today to manage these with precisions and avoid excessive pool show, avoiding the wrong subcategories focus. In other words, ensuring a good return of our investments during the recovery. Our ability to do that has dramatically increased, thanks to analytics, which are not only giving us more data to understand what's happening but is giving us more data to anticipate what is going to happen, and that's what we are working on. Good morning. Yes, sure. First of all, Gibu is now in -- since some months and is an exceptional new lead -- new hire and a leader, well integrated by now in our organization. He will bring our online business to next level. As you said, we have done well for many years, but he is here to bring it to a completely new level. And so the priority is, first of all, to continue our growth and leverage this huge acceleration in every single channel, in brand.com, in third parties, in pure plays, in retail.com and in making sure that we have the circulation of the best practices around the world, that we learn from what's happening in every angle in -- of the world, both in our business and in what competition or retailers are doing, the third-party are doing. But I would say the center of all this is to add more technology in order to make the consumer experience in each one of these touch points really, really high quality and even more competitive. So the focus is on taking the consumer experience to the next level. You heard me speaking in the past about chats, virtual try-on, live streaming, and many other experiences that are possible but need to become better and better over time and surprise the consumer for positive. And if we do that correctly, we will continue to drive traffic to our online because we will attract traffic, not only because of our great brands, of our great innovation, but also because of our outstanding services online and because of the experience online that will be frictionless. And also, we will need to make sure that this happens in a very efficient way and in a way which is driven by technology and become consistent across the world so that we can scale it very fast every single time this is going to be needed. And finally, we -- also, one of the priorities is to make digital advertising, and particularly, all the advertise linked to eCommerce more efficient and more effective. And with these to continue to push conversion that will be one of the key challenges and the key opportunities of the next year's in the world of online. Hello. Yes. Our -- again, Tracey, I will let you add any perspective. But anyway, our travel retail business is up. And so is -- I would say that the recovery will be in net extra versus what is already growth. So what's happened in this field, as you all know, is that the domestic travel in general and particularly within China has been more than offsetting the lack of international travel all over the world and particularly in the west. And so in this moment, we expect the strengths that today in travel retail, in domestic travel in China with Hainan and with new centers like Shenzhen, the Greater Bay and other opportunities which are emerging over time, we expect this to continue and to remain very, very solid. But then at certain moment when international travel will be restated, then we expect international travel to bring net extra opportunities, particularly in the west where there will be obviously many more populations going back to travel. And when this will happen, we envision travel retail to be even stronger than what used to be historically and definitely stronger than today which is mainly driven by only the domestic travel part. So strong reality today, a strong future for travel retail. Now travel retail is about traffic, which what I was commenting on now, speaking about the future recovery in international travel. But it's also true about conversion, which is the percentage of travelers that buy something. So we have seen recently the conversion going up, driven by pretail. So the ability to buy online when you travel. Now, pretail is accelerating in Asia, is a very -- it's already about one-third of the business in many parts of Asia and is not yet very present or very significant in the west. So we see in the future pretail to continue to grow and to be a significant part on travel retail. And with the growth of pretail, we see the opportunity of increased growth or conversion. And in that sense, the -- these -- the traffic coming back plus conversion of travelers into buyers continue to progress, those two KPIs will represent a very solid future for travel retail. Good morning. Yes. And so frankly, I just want to underline what Tracey said. I will read in this more of a strong Q2, particularly driven by an extraordinary 11.11 where some of our brands were topped in the 11.11 project and by the fact that holidays were a moment also in the West. They were pretty positive. People were possible, they were allowed, went back to shopping, some brick-and-mortar were open. And then, maybe because these holidays where in some places were open to early, then there was a lot of closures immediately after that, Japan, U.K. Italy, part of North America, Canada. So we've got an enormous amount of closures in the January, March period, in the West particularly, and Japan, obviously. And so that's the combination. The combination is the pandemic impact on brick-and-mortar. Now, keep in mind that as you have seen in the results, we have extraordinary skin care and fragrance, and [indiscernible] brand is doing really strong. The question is the makeup recovery, and the makeup is very linked to the comeback of the brick-and-mortar experience. So all the closures that happened actually after the holidays in many Western markets and in Japan did have an impact on makeup. And we have seen that. So I would not say there is any long-term sign in this Q3. Actually, it is an extraordinarily strong Q3. By the way, it was ahead of our guidance because we had seen that in our guidance. We had seen these kinds of things that would have happened because of the closures. And so it was a very strong quarter and Q2 was just an extraordinary quarter. But as Tracey said, Q2 will be pretty strong because in the future there will be always a combination of holidays and a strong peak of commercial activities like 11.11 and more that we create a high in terms of an absolute level of sales. No, no, I would definitely not. I think we are counting on it, again, as the COVID abates and the opening. As I've said before, I want to repeat that, makeup is about user education. So -- and the user education on makeup at exactly the social and professional occasions that when there are closures or when the pandemic is very active and not there and so consumption goes down. So we are really -- we don't see any reason why we would not go back to first stabilization and then growth in makeup when these social occasions come back and these professional occasion comebacks. Just want to take the opportunity to make the pictures. Today, we have our current drivers, which are the Chinese consumer, the global online, and the skin care category and now the high-end fragrance category that will continue to drive. There is no discussion. These areas have been accelerated by COVID. But in reality, their trends were strong already before, so COVID does accelerated, and we are really ready and as you see we are having great success on these drivers even in the middle of COVID. Now, there are new drivers that should be added to these drivers as COVID will abate. Makeup usage, as I said, brick-and-mortar productivity in most markets, certain markets and consumer groups like U.S., U.K., Japan, continental Europe, emerging markets today are unfortunately really badly hit by COVID. We come back, and we gradually come back as the COVID improves. Younger consumer consumption, which is especially linked to makeup will come back. And the TR [ph] outside of Hainan as we said before and pretail acceleration will come back. So there are all these new drivers that we need to accelerate in the next 18 months assuming that will be the pace of return from COVID gradually. Then there are new strengths that we have built during COVID and we have invested in them. There is better innovation in Asia with the center in Shanghai and the quality of our innovation that is creating higher repeat process rates. There is more skin care and more makeup skinification and we have more production capacity of high quality production capacity in our upcoming factory in Tokyo; better consumer understanding and better ability to anticipate trends driven by our investment in analytics; more resources for advertising, especially digital advertising, which is increasing; better high touch services online, as I explained before when there was a question on online; brand portfolio, which is becoming stronger with the acquisition of DECIEM and Dr. Jart; a huge investment and acceleration in every ESG activity during COVID. And all of these combined is what I call the new strengths that we are bringing to the [indiscernible]. So the way we see it is that the current drivers will drive, the new drivers including makeup will come back and the new strengths that we have built in Este\u0301e Lauder Companies during this year will hit. And that's why we really believe that this quarter is just the confirmation that we are creating a very solid long-term sustainable growth pattern for the company."

            "name": "Tracey Travis",
            "content": "Thank you, Fabrizio. I certainly echo that statement and look forward to the continued progression of our recovery. For our fiscal third quarter, net sales rose 13% as we left the onset of the COVID pandemic, and delivered exceptional growth in the Asia Pacific region and in the skin care and fragrance categories. While our brick-and-mortar distribution continue to experience soft foot traffic, our online channel delivered strong growth across all formats and all regions. Conversely, the environments in Western Europe, Latin America and parts of North America were challenged throughout the quarter. Our gross margin increased 90 basis points compared to the prior year quarter favorability and category and channel mix driven by skin care and online growth, as well as lower tester costs were partially offset by obsolescence, negative currency and COVID related under recovery of fixed cost primarily in our facilities that manufacture makeup products. Operating expenses improved by 530 basis points compared to the prior year quarter, largely reflecting the improved sales leverage this year. You will recall that when the pandemic struck in the prior year quarter, the sudden and dramatic drop in sales created expense deleverage that was difficult to fully offset despite the cost actions we took at that time. This quarter, we benefited from both temporary and longer term cost savings, which is reflected in the substantially lower selling and store operating costs as a percent of sales continued to shift from brick-and-mortar to online as sales continued to shift from brick-and-mortar to online. This was due in part to temporary store closures in response to a resurgence of the virus in certain EMEA and Latin American markets. We realize some subsidies and the extension of furlough benefits in some of the affected markets. We've also prudently managed staffing levels in our stores, and new hires on our management teams, until we see the recovery gaining more consistent momentum. Advertising spending grew double digits, and was predominantly focused on digital spending. We invested to support our online acceleration as well as our new product launches, a strong recovery in certain markets and key shopping moments such as Lunar New Year, Women's Day and Valentine's Day. As a result, our operating margin rose 620 basis points to 20.5%, which was 40 basis points above fiscal '19 level. Our effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 20.7%. The lower tax rate for the quarter was primarily due to a lower rate on the company's foreign operations. Diluted EPS of $1.62 increased 92% compared to the prior year. EPS exceeded our expectations primarily due to the higher sales, continued cost management and a lower effective tax rate. Our plans under the post-COVID business acceleration program are progressing. Year-to-date, we have taken actions in three main areas to adjust our distribution footprint in Latin America and EMEA including travel retail, to exit global distribution of BECCA products, and to realign resources and capabilities, including employee related costs between our brick-and-mortar and online channels. We are already beginning to realize the modest benefits from these actions. As the program continues, we expect to further rationalize our brick-and-mortar retail footprint, primarily in Western markets. For the 9 months, we generated $2.78 billion in net cash flows from operating activities, which was substantially above the prior year, primarily due to higher net earnings as well as working capital improvements. We invested $386 million in capital expenditures to support key investment areas like production and distribution capacity and technology, including our online business. Conversely, we spent far less on counters and stores. We ended the period with approximately $6.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents, including cash from $600 million and senior notes issued in March to support the increased equity investment in DECIEM, once the deal was finalized. We also reinstated our share buyback program in March and utilized $316 million of cash to repurchase our stock and we paid $561 million in dividends. After the end of the quarter, we used $450 million in cash to pay down debt maturing in the fourth quarter. Given our strong cash generation this year, we still remain in a very strong position to pursue further growth opportunities after these actions. So now, let's turn to our outlook. We continue to be encouraged by the sequential improvement we have seen in our business throughout the fiscal year. And we are optimistic that restrictions and hesitancy on travel and social activities will begin to ease in certain markets as vaccine coverage steadily increases. In China, Australia, and Israel, which are at the leading edge of recovery, we are seeing higher makeup sales with usage occasions increasing as social and professional engagements gradually normalize. For example, sales in our freestanding stores in Israel have returned to pre-pandemic level and even lipstick sales are almost back to normal. The upcoming addition of the DECIEM brands to our portfolio and the expansion of our business with Sephora and Ulta beauty in the U.S. represent additional growth drivers for us as we progress in recovery from the pandemic shock, giving us further cause for optimism. We have led with our strengths, our values and our amazing team and have proactively addressed areas where which we could control while at the same time ensuring we are protecting our strategic growth areas. As a result, in the context of a very challenging environment in fiscal 2021, we expect to end the year with sales growth of between 9% and 10% in constant currency. Currency translation is expected to add approximately 2 percentage points to reported growth, reflecting rates of 1.18 for the Euro, 1.33 for the pound and 6.64 for the Yuan. 6 months of incremental sales from the December 2019 acquisition of Dr. Jart, and approximately 1 month expected from DECIEM are contributing approximately 2 percentage points to our expectations of growth for the year. Mindful of the more gradual resumption of traffic to our brick-and-mortar distribution, we kept tight control over costs this year to protect investments needed for long-term growth. Some of the costs we cut temporarily will gradually return as more doors open, subsidies will correspondingly diminish and we plan to meaningfully ramp up advertising spending in our fourth quarter as consumers return to social and professional engagements. That said, we expect to end this fiscal year with an operating margin of approximately 18.5%, an improvement of roughly 100 basis points above fiscal 2019. Full year EPS is expected to be between $6.05 and $6.15, before restructuring and other charges. This reflects approximately $0.10 accretion from currency translation and $0.04 dilution from acquisitions. Our fourth quarter sales are expected to rise between 44% and 50% in constant currency. This reflects both the recovery in many parts of the world as well as an easier comparison against the prior year period most impacted by the pandemic. Currency is expected to be accretive by approximately 4 percentage points and the addition of approximately 1 month of sales from DECIEM would contribute less than 2 percentage points to sales growth. Fourth quarter EPS is expected to be between $0.38 and $0.48, reflecting the sales outlook and increased investments to support the ramp up of our innovate -- innovation and manufacturing capabilities in Asia. Continued investment to drive our online business and the advertising and promotion to support recovery, with a resulting operating margin more typical of our pre-pandemic levels of mid to high single-digit in the quarter. Currency is expected to add $0.02 to EPS, and the addition of DECIEM is immaterial for the quarter, given the short timeframe in purchase accounting. In closing, we are pleased with our performance in the third quarter in the context of a challenging macro backdrop. Our skin care and fragrance brands have proven to be resilient during this time, as consumers shifted online and we enhanced the digital experience with increased services on our sites. As we navigate through the final months of our fiscal year, we are investing in both the near-term recovery and the drivers of long-term sustainable growth that create value for our multiple stakeholders. While it is difficult to predict the growth of global prestige beauty in the near-term, we are confident as we have demonstrated that we can nimbly allocate resources to continue to operate with agility and gain share as the recovery gives way to the new normal. That concludes our prepared remarks and we'll be happy to take your questions at this time. And you covered it, Fabrizio. And the only thing I would add, Dara, to what Fabrizio said, we are obviously watching traffic patterns and travel patterns pretty closely. Our travel retail team is -- so international travel is really projected at this point in time not to recover until perhaps even the second half of fiscal '20 -- our fiscal '22. So again, we're watching it closely obviously. If it will recover sooner, the travel retail business internationally in terms of consumption would pick up correspondingly. But in the meantime, the travel retail team has done a fantastic job of making sure that we are managing the Western travel retail markets prudently in terms of investments until we see the recovery of traffic and consumption in the Western markets. And the only thing I -- the other thing I would say is that travel retail and online combined now are a little more than half of our total business. And so when you think about our growth momentum going forward and the recovery -- the strength that we see in online and the recovery of travel retail it bodes very well for our future growth. Good morning, Jason. Yes. I mean, I will start, Jason. I think that what we're seeing more and more in the business particularly in Asia Pacific is more seasonality of the business. So Q2, as you indicate has become a very large quarter for us. It always was a large quarter with holiday. But with the addition of 11.11 and tremendous growth of that holiday year-over-year, we're seeing a very large sales number in our second quarter. In the third quarter, as Fabrizio mentioned, China had a very strong third quarter. We did have some large markets in Asia that were a bit softer, Japan. And I think through this pandemic, we are going to see ups and downs until things really more sustainably get back to normal when vaccine rates obviously accelerate a bit. So I would not read anything long-term into it other than this is still part of the pandemic in terms of seeing up and down performance in various markets. Similarly in terms of EMEA as well, obviously, outside of travel retail, but the Western markets in EMEA were also quite challenged in the quarter as well. So that we expect to see until, again, we see more stabilization and normalization from the pandemic. Operator, next question? And the only thing I would add to that is, just to underscore some of the investment in technology we've made for virtual try-on. So when you think about those social and professional occasions coming back, whether someone wants to come in the store and try makeup or if they want to try it online, the engagement that we see online from some of the capabilities and features that we've added to online certainly bodes very well for when those occasions come back and the makeup category acceleration. Yes. So, Chris, as you know we typically give forward guidance for the upcoming fiscal year in August, which we will certainly do. I mean this has been an unusual year because of all of the things that you've mentioned. We had part of the year where we had temporary salary reductions, we've had furloughs and we've also done a fantastic job, our teams have, in terms of managing costs. Some of those costs will come back next year and some of them won't. Some of the door closures that we've permanently done, those costs and the remaining fleet of doors should be more productive as traffic continues to accelerate to brick-and-mortar, which is where we see the bulk of the recovery. So given the cost actions that we've taken, given where we expect growth to come from next year disproportionately, we would expect continued margin progression. But we will be able to say more specifically what that will be in the August timeframe. But as we've said for many years, our growth areas are all margin accretive when you think about travel retail, when you think about online when you think about the strength that we've had over multiple years in terms of skin care. And as Fabrizio said, we expect skin care and fragrance to continue to grow and makeup will also grow more strongly certainly next year as those occasions come back. So we've got multiple engines, multiple ways to progress margin even as investments do come back for brick-and-mortar and in other areas. We will, in the fourth quarter as you indicate, and as I said in my prepared remarks, so -- strongly invest as we normally do for a start of a strong fiscal year and we will invest more in advertising to support what we believe will be an acceleration. It's selectively in the markets that we think that it will happen in. Just thank everybody for obviously their interest in the company. And again, I think we want to thank all of our teams for the fantastic performance navigating through what has been a difficult year, but we are incredibly proud, as I mentioned and Fabrizio mentioned of our results. And certainly, we look forward to closing the year strong with the guidance that we provided. So thank you, everyone."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, everyone and welcome to The Est\u00e9e Lauder Company's Fiscal 2021 Second Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded and webcast. For opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Rainey Mancini.\nRainey Mancini: Hello. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges and adjustments disclosed in our press release. All net sales growth numbers are in constant currency and all organic results exclude the impacts of acquisitions. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investors section of our website. As a reminder, references to online sales include sales we make directly to our consumers through Brand.com site and through third-party platforms. It also includes estimated sales of our products through our retailer\u2019s websites. During the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question so we can respond to all of you within the time scheduled for this call. And now I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio.\nFabrizio Freda: Thank you, Rainey and hello everyone. Let me first with that each of you are in good health and that your  families are well. Our hearts continue to be with those impacted by COVID-19 and our focus remains first and foremost on the health and safety of our employees, their families and our consumers. To our employees, you have lifted us up from caring for the physical and emotional wellbeing of colleagues to make in-hand sanitizer, seeking opportunities to support charities around the world, generously contributing to LCK [ph] employee relief fund and so much more. In December the company made an addition donation to the employees' fund and we continue to make progress on our citizenship and social impact commitments. Our employee's agility and creativity empower the company to deliver the exceptional results we announced today. For the second quarter in fiscal year 2021, sales rose 3% a 12 point positive swing from the decline of 9% in the first quarter. Impressively time brands grew led by the double-digit growth from Est\u00e9e Lauder and La Mer as well as great performance from Jo Malone London. Le Labo and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle also rose double-digits. We focus our investment decisions on engines of growth while employing strict cost discipline in other areas delivering strong double-digit adjusted diluted earnings per share growth. In the quarter we faced increasing complexity from the pandemic, yet still delivered the results that exceeded our record second quarter of fiscal year 2020 when sales grew, the strongest in 20 years in our seasonally largest quarter. Our multiple engines of growth strategy continued to prove its value, enabling us to pivot with a GDP in this challenging moment. We successfully activated efforts behind the growth engines of skincare, fragrance, Asia-Pacific, travel retail in Asia and global online. Our skincare category performance extraordinarily. It's accelerating growth reflected the strong locally relevant innovation, successful year strategies, compelling ingredient narrative and deeper consumer relationships enabled by sophisticated data and analytics. Growth of our high repeat Hero products was broad based across sub categories from cleanses to watery lotion, serum, eye care and moisturizers. Our skin care business has continued to grow from strength to strength, bolstered by the teaser mind of the ritual of skincare as an expression of healthcare. From entry prestige to luxury, our brands excelled in skincare. Many brands contributed demonstrating the breadth of our performance. Dr. Jart provided incremental sales from our double-digit organic growth, we did appealing brand positioning. The Est\u00e9e Lauder brand once again delivered double-digit growth across several of these Hero franchises in skincare. It's new advanced narrative serum was a powerful force, thanks to its new formula, a luxurious, more sustainable glass bottle. The serum delivered a healthy fit to Advanced Night Repair eye and these two Hero products benefited from their synergies and desirable sets. The brands revitalizing supreme franchise accelerated significantly, gaining momentum with its Hero moisturizer. La Mer leadership in luxury skincare group as consumers demand for its iconic products with powerful proven secrecy sort. Here two serum was a vibrant sub category. It's new debt concentrate was a big contributor to growth, amplifying trends of Hero like Van De La Mer and the treatment lotion. The new Genaissance de La Mer concentrated night balm performed exceptionally well, driving the brand's ultra luxury franchise to new highs. Clinique returned to growth lifted by skincare as it's Hero franchises that are focused on how to solve skincare problems like acme and dark spot, even better clinical interrupter is now firmly established as a core performance of the brand and continues to deliver significant growth. It was complimented by an acceleration in the brand's three-step product and acne solution lines. Our luxury and our seasonal fragrances captivated consumer desires for Tone for Beauty, Joe Malone London, Le Labo, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle and Kilian Paris innovations in iconic products were both highly sold. These brands all delivered stellar online sales growth along with improving brick-and-mortar sales in certain markets. Joe Malone London and Le Labo home products continue to flourish as consumer crave the sense to alleviate the sanctuary of their homes. Our global online channel delivered outstanding double-digit sales growth, significantly accelerated from the previous quarter and driven by every region. Growth was robust across the board as brand.com third party platforms, pure play and retail.com all contributed meaningfully. Our go to market strategies for each of these were tremendously successful, particularly during Black Friday, Fiber Week and [indiscernible] 1111 Global Shopping festival, driving strong consumer acquisition and retention. We continue to enhance our brand sites with high catch services. These strategies -- these strategic investments are elevating the consumer experience from convenience buying to enriched shopping, completely useful tools, targeted recommendation and expert advice. Across our brands, we are uniquely combining technology and data with our talented youth advisor on a global scale. Digital is proving to be incredibly powerful, driving over twice the engagement as well as higher conversion and retention rates. In the quarter, we added digital try [ph] to more sites around the world. The number of sessions nearly doubled from the pre quarter, reflecting both the expansion to additional sites as well as big uptick in activity on brand site that had previously launched it. Digital chat is also proving to be very impactful. In North America conversion of live chat session is nearly four times higher than average conversion in the market. Digital chat usage accelerated during the holiday season as our skilled beauty advisor offered useful insights and customized education to consumers, driving much higher basket site than average. Our brands are increasingly offsetting other engaging digital services and the experienced. Two examples are found on Clinique.com. Clinique Reality, the brand skin agnostic tool extracts the consumer in a highly personalized manner, driving notably strong conversion rates and Clinique Skin School addresses the growing demand for credible education in an entertaining format with a new focus on real-time interactions. Skin School brilliantly integrates live chat and trend-based programming with a brand expert consultant. We continue to pursue high touch innovation online as evidenced by the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand new AI driven product recommendations based on real-time consumer behavior and past preferences that we're piloting in North America. We anticipate that these dynamic merchandising holds great promise and are excited to scale in this year for Est\u00e9e Lauder as well for other brands. We are welcoming new consumers on our brand sites, but also successfully driving repeat enable in part by our loyalty programs. In the first half of fiscal year 2021, the number of loyalty programs members who both rose strong double-digits driven by travel digit growth of international loyalty program members. In so many ways, we are building deeper relationship with our consumers. Our brands delivered excellent results for [indiscernible] 1111 Global shopping Festival leveraging the latest live streaming technology and capabilities to generate product discovery. For 1111 the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand moved into the number one rank in beauty. La Mer notched number one rank in luxury beauty. Mac was the number one prestige make up brand and Jo Malone London was the leader in fragrance. We have long believed in the compelling growth prospects of online and had been investing in it for more than two decades. At the onset of COVID-19, we nearly doubled our rate of online investment, including accelerating our consumer facing investment like digital, social selling, Omni channel or loyalty programs. We're also increasing our investment in our digital infrastructure and fulfillment network to meet the much higher traffic and demand. In addition to these capital investments, we continue to optimize our advertising investment in digital channels as well as invest in our great online talent domestically in our headquarters in New York and in our local markets around the world. I'm on the regions, Asia-Pacific delivered the strongest sequential improvement with sales growth accelerating from 7% to 27%. Mainland China prospered while Korea and several smaller markets contributed organically. In Mainland China momentum in brick-and-mortar carried into the quarter with sales again growing double-digit. Online accelerated significantly, elevated by a remarkable 1111 event. Nearly every brand grew as across Le brands we reached more consumers, thanks to locally relevant innovation Hero products, rich storytelling and successful influencer activations, as well as the dedication and creativity of the local team in China. Travel retail grew single-digit organically driven by strong results in Asia, particularly in Heinen as we fulfilled the desires of the travelling Chinese consumers with a deal merchandizing. Traffic to Heinen continued to rebound and duty free annual partial limit had increased threefold there in July, providing a favorable benefit in the quarter as consumers saw to spend to the new annual limit before year-end. Conversion was also a strong driver, owing prepaid, which newly offered live streaming. Across channels, demand from Chinese consumers accelerated, especially in skincare and fragrance. The long-term growth opportunity we foresee in the dynamic Asia-Pacific region rebounded. Over the last fixed demands despite the challenges of the pandemic we made three significant investment commitments as we strive to best meet the desires of Chinese and Asian consumers. In late 2019, we acquired the Korean based skincare brand Dr. Jart, while in nearly 2020, we committed to build an end to end innovation center in Shanghai. Today I'm pleased to confer we're building a state of art manufacturing facility near Tokyo. We're on track to open our Shanghai innovation center in spring 2022. This will increase our local capabilities in product design and formulation. We're also strengthening our consumer insight and trend analytics in this vibrant market. We broke ground in our new manufacturing facility near Tokyo, which is to be operational in late 2022. It will enable us to better meet demand and increase speed to market in the region. The facility will house advanced technologies and engineering achievement, with high standards of sustainability and safety and will be designed to promote flexible and leading-edge working environment. Across our engines, innovation contributed significantly in the second quarter ahead of our aggressive goals driven by focus on fewer bigger and better Hero innovations. We have an enticing pipeline of new product launches for the remainder of our fiscal year. Already our are two in skincare, the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand launched supreme bright. It addresses the trend of bright in Asia and is also highly relevant for consumers of old skin tones around the world with it's even better skin tone, dark spot benefits meeting top needs of the multiethnic consumers. Clinique introduced monster sewage search one handed hour with an exclusive deal that provides hydration that goes 10 layers deep into skin surface and also lasts 100 hours even after you wash your face. In the Clinique launched even better clinical serum foundation a weightless liquid foundation with 24 hours ware, a good for skin ingredients to have visibly improving skin instantly and over time. Our strategic focus and investment in our ESG goals remain of utmost importance for us in our key stakeholders and we continue to advance our work in the quarter. Let me share a few examples in sustainable ingredients in packaging and inclusion and diversity for the many areas of our recent progress. We're pleased to have joined CDPs 2020 Climate A list having been awarded the highest score of A. In January Aveda proudly announced that its products are bigger as a mission driven brand this was a natural step for Aveda, a brand that continuously works to reduce its environmentally but while also responding to the fast-growing consumer trends. Our brands are employing more innovative and sustainable packaging as they launch new products while also improving the packaging of existing products, the two new Clinique products, which I just described two such example of innovation launching in more sustainable package. To continue to invest in, in advance our diverse talent, we created a sponsorship program for equitable advance and professional development of our black talent from every chair leadership development program will ensure that our black employees have the support and focus of senior executives and equitable access to leadership training, mentorship and career development opportunities. In closing we delivered excellent performance amid the pandemic, leveraging the strength of our multiple engines of growth strategy, Hero products and robust innovation. We did this while leading our values as we increasingly embedded ESG in everything we do, focusing on safety and wellbeing of our employees, making progress on our environment goals, enacting on our racial equity commitments. We also invested in technology and data for new capabilities to support accelerating growth drivers. These accomplishments and actions give us confidence that we are well-positioned to continue to drive recovery and return to our long-term growth targets after the period of recovery. I'm incredibly grateful to our employees whose grace and fortitude are making us a better company throughout this very difficult moment. While the road ahead will still be challenging together we can be optimistic that brighter days are coming. I wish each one of you good health. And now, I'll turn the call over to Tracy.\nTracey Travis: Thank you, Fabrizio and I certainly echo your comments regarding our wonderful employees. As a reminder, my commentary today is adjusted for the items that Renee mentioned at the beginning of the call and net sales growth numbers are in constant currency. Our net sales rose 3% in the second quarter. The COVID-19 pandemic continue to pressure traffic in our brick-and-mortar distribution, but sales declines in stores were entirely offset by strong growth across our online channels and in travel retail in Asia. The December 2019 acquisition of Dr. Jar added approximately three point to net sales growth. Sales performed above our expectations in large part reflecting the outstanding execution during the annual team 1111 Shopping festival as well as the many activations our brands deployed during key shopping events like Brett Black Friday and Fiber Week. In addition to the acceleration and growth we saw in skincare, fragrance sales were strong in the quarter and home fragrance continued to resonate during the pandemic. Our gross margin increased 10 basis points compared to last year's second quarter. Favorable channel mix was driven by the growth in our online sales and also reflects lower costs for testers in our brick-and-mortar distribution. From a category perspective, the acceleration of sales in skincare also benefited gross margin. The positive mix was partially offset by higher obsolescence and a negative currency impact. Operating expenses improved by 160 basis points as a percent of sales, reflecting both the strength of our sales leverage during key shopping moments and our cost containment measures. Many of our COVID related cost containment measures remained in place during the quarter and contributed to our improved profitability along with the benefits of our leading beauty forward initiative. Lower selling cost and other in-store promotion cost also reflected the mix shift of our business from brick-and-mortar to online as well as some remaining government subsidies in certain countries. Given the challenged environment, we continue to experience periodic tour closures. Partially offsetting the cost favorability was higher investment behind our strategic priorities, including China, online and digital technology as well as the inclusion of Dr. Jart expenses this year. As a result, our operating margin rose 170 basis points to 24.3%, a significant accomplishment during this important holiday quarter considering the record results achieved in the year ago period. Our effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 15.9%. The lower tax rate for the quarter was primarily due to the recognition of a onetime retroactive benefit related to recently finalized guilty US tax rate regulation. We now expect our effective tax rate for the year to be approximately 20% reflecting this development. Diluted EPS of $2.61 increased 24% compared to the prior year. EPS was higher than expected due primarily to the combination of strong performance during the key shopping moments in the quarter and the lower tax rate while maintaining strict cost management. This performance is truly a testament to our team's ability to navigate the business through the difficult macroenvironment. Our plans under the post-COVID business acceleration program are progressing. Through the past six months, we've taken charges of $46 million primarily to close underperforming freestanding retail stores in our EMEA region and an employee-related cost as we align resources to support our online business and our digital capabilities. As the program continues in the second half we expect to continue to rationalize our retail footprint primarily in Western market. Additionally, we took an $81 million impairment charge for our glam glove brand reflecting the COVID-related disruption of the brand growth plans and lower than expected growth from its planned geographic expansion. During the first half of our fiscal year, we generated $1.98 billion in net cash flows from operating activities, which was substantially above the prior year, due primarily to improvements in working capital management. Accounts payable increased reflecting timing-related items that also support our second-half growth plans and accounts receivable reflected the rapid growth in our direct to consumer business and a five-day improvement in DSO. We invested $250 million in capital expenditures to support key investment areas like additional production capacity and technology. Conversely we spent far less on counters and stores due to lower traffic and brick-and-mortar doors. We ended December with $5.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents just above our total debt. With the strength of our cash position, our free cash flow generation and our confidence in our business drivers as we recover, we expect to reinstate share repurchases and maintain our dividend during the second half of our fiscal year. So now let's turn to our outlook, we are obviously encouraged by the sequential improvement we saw in every region as we continue to manage through the effects of the pandemic. While cases of COVID-19 and the variance of surging again in some markets, resulting in renewed door closures, restrictions and lockdowns, we are optimistic that once the vaccines reach enough of the global population, the restrictions on travel and social activities will ease. Nonetheless we've not assume a second wave. Therefore, the more accelerated global recovery we originally anticipated in our second half has clearly been delayed. So while we are pleased with our performance in the first half, the prolonged uncertainty with respect to the pace and timing of the recovery makes it still difficult to provide sales and EPS guidance for the full year. We do continue to expect sequential, quarterly sales growth improvement as comparisons to the prior year ease and the global recovery unfolds. The inclusion of six months of incremental sales from the acquisition of Dr. Jart, which benefited our growth in the first half adds two percentage points to sales growth for the full fiscal year. As you know, several of our retail customers are liquidating or reducing their store footprints. Notably Lord & Taylor, Staged Stores and [indiscernible] are liquidating and Macy's, Nordstrom [ph] have announced store reductions. Additionally, we expect to close certain freestanding stores in North America and EMEA now that the holidays are behind us. In aggregate, the law sales represent between 1% and 2% of our total full-year sales and we do expect to recapture a portion of those sales in other locations in online. While we will continue to execute our cost savings programs, it is important to recognize that some of the temporary cost measures we took last year will be returning in the coming months. The principal areas of returning cost includes some additional advertising, promotion and point-of-sale employee cost, which were all meaningfully reduced during the time that retail doors were closed last year, as well as the restoration of certain temporary pay reductions we took. Travel and retail consulting costs are expected to ramp up more slowly. Costs will also increase as offices reopen and our facility to continue to implement enhanced safety protocols. We will incur incremental spending for our new Asian manufacturing plant and innovation center and as we continue to see signs of consumer's willingness to resume their normal activities including return to stores, we plan to invest incrementally as we normally did pre-pandemic in our fourth quarter to strongly support our launch programs and begin to reaccelerate our makeup business in the upcoming fiscal year. Looking at the near term, for the third quarter we expect sales to rise between 10% and 11% in constant currency. We have a terrific lineup of product offerings and activations for the Lunar New Year and we expect continued strong online sales. You may recall that we had an exceptional January last year. We have lacked the purchase of Dr. Jart at the beginning of our third quarter and the brand is now part of our organic growth. Currently, is expected to be accretive by approximately three percentage points. Third quarter EPS is expected to be between $1.10 and $1.20 reflecting the sales outlook and a careful balance between cost containment measures and investment in key growth areas such as online and technology and currency is expected to add $0.03 to EPS. We remain optimistic that the pandemic will be controlled and out of home activities will resume under a new normal. With a solid first half behind us, we've proven we can deliver in the context of a difficult macroenvironment while continuing to support our employees, our social and environmental commitment and invest in the capabilities needed to sustain our growth over the long term. The resiliency of our business during this time and the passion and dedication of our teams, reinforce our confidence in our strategy and the continuation of our ability to deliver long-term sustainable growth. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] And our first question is going to come from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: So I wanted to focus on topline, clearly very strong performance in skincare and e-commerce during COVID. Can you talk about the sustainability of that strength in each of those areas as we move to a post-COVID environment as well as what some of your key strategies might be to maintain momentum post-COVID and then on the makeup side, that's obviously been a laggard area for obvious reasons. How quickly do you think category growth recovers in makeup post-COVID and what's your outlook there, thanks?\nFabrizio Freda: Okay. So first of all, the key drivers for us let's go one by one, skincare very sustainable. The consumers always were more and more enthusiastic for skincare. We have an amazing pipeline innovation for the future years and the strengths of Asia and particularly of China is internal mix one of the biggest builder of skincare because the penetration of skincare, the penetration of beauty for skincare in Asia is very, very high. So we assume the skincare strengths will continue after COVID. The other driver is China and the potential of China as we explained very well at our Investor Day is for the long-term. The Chinese -- the demographic arrived the potential of the smaller cities of tier three and tier four cities will continue to grow. The power of online and offline distribution will continue to be very strong. In TR imagine that the TR growth today, the TR results are mainly driven by Asia and particularly by the domestic travel acceleration within China. So in the future, the domestic travel acceleration within China will continue, but the international travel will be reinstated and so this will be a father acceleration in the long-term when COVID will abate. So all our key drivers are really here for the long-term and most importantly as you know, our drivers tend to be accretive in profitability. So they will clear resources over time. The lager is a brick-and-mortar particularly in the West. Now this obviously in the short term is an issue because there is a lack of traffic and the lack of traffic has created issues of productivity but also on this one, we are working for rebuilding this for the long-term and so what is a drag today, a big drag on what is about one third of our business is still in brick-and-mortar in the West and so you should imagine that the traffic post COVID will come back that there are all the retailer closures that Tracy summarized, which are happening that will reduce the amount of stores which not be sustainable in the long term and our business acceleration program, which is really putting that right sizing if you want all the channel for us rebuilding productivity over time. And so the combination of traffic closures and business acceleration program is our answer to in the long term after COVID been able to make also brick-and-mortar a gain and engines of growth, which will be profitable in building the company for the long-term. So we are very positive in summary on the continuous trends post COVID of our drivers, new accelerated drivers and we are working to make also what is a drag in the short-term rebuilt as a positive long-term channel which is the brick-and-mortar in the West. Internal makeup was the last part of your question, makeup is very much driven by user locations. So user location meaning to going to the office, going out for dinner, having etcetera. So clearly the makeup category growth will be associated with the post recovery and we will be ready for that. Our point of view is that when the user location will go back into the lives of people, the recovery will be fast and steep and so we are ready for that. Now if when do we assume this will happen frankly, the answer is difficult to answer the same way Tracey explained is difficult to answer, when vaccination all the rest will have a full impact, but we believe that from what we see in the market just casting the full of 2021, we could see beginning of certain usage location to the established because of this makeup growth with follow back in our opinion starting from that moment particularly.\nOperator: And our next question is going to come from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: I was curious if we could talk a little bit about e-commerce development in Western Europe in particular because I think with certain hidden if you will in the numbers you work through contributions from travel retail and so on is that Western Europe while still down of course is down I think a lot less than has been the case thus far through the pandemic. You mentioned the Cyber Week kind of shopping dynamic in Western Europe, but my sense is that that is a channel that had been somewhat less developed. Historically, so I'd love to hear more about how that build up and thinking about kind of stickiness of that behavior going ahead particularly in a quarter to whether aren't big shopping events that are typical for that market thanks.\nFabrizio Freda: So first of all the online business has done very well this quarter plus 60% globally and is interesting we are growing double or triple digit in every brand, every region, every channel, a meaningful channel brand.com, retail.com, third party platform pure plays and so Western Europe is the same. Western Europe is growing depending by market double-digit or triple digit in online and obviously the holiday season has been because of the lockdown as you know in Western Europe particularly COVID was pretty high in November, December. Because of this, the brick-and-mortar were closed in countries like the UK as an example, December was a super difficult month and so it was no regular Christmas holidays in brick-and-mortar and obviously UK was not the only place and so because of this we were able to pivot to online in an historical way. I think our teams have done an amazing work in taking care of our consumer online when they were because of proven behavior for COVID now going into the brick-and-mortar and what we've seen that this works in many, many cases meaning again the consumer's certain categories we're working because of repeat meaning the consumer didn\u2019t do without their preferred Le Mer cream or their preferred advanced whatever and so we got a lot of the selling via the online channel. But also we are able to stick to their gifting habits and we created gifting opportunities and delivering all those for gifting etcetera. So it was a lot of activity and invention in this area. Now this online in general, I believe the online will continue to be very strong also in the long-term and this acceleration will continue also post COVID and one of the reason for that which is particularly true in Western Europe is that the new online focus created growth online, more than created new consumers including more mature consumers. Online particularly in Europe was really dedicated to millennial or younger consumers while during COVID, more mature consumers came online and they're lacking it and they're becoming loyal and so they will also post COVID have a bigger percentage of their shopping online than before. On top of this, if you think that we are adding high touch services online, so what were the services that in before were available in brick-and-mortar now gradually but they're also available online and we've been able to scale the speed online. Just to give you a number to understand our ability to scale new ideas is today digital try [ph] is already available in 90% of our brand.com sales internal coverage. Now imagine that that it was not even close to that six months ago and so the consumer responded to that and this is driving also in Western Europe a lot of online and probably sustainable and more loyalty online across different group of consumers. So online had a big role in Western Europe in quarter two and will continue to have a bigger and growing role over time in the next years.\nOperator: And our next question is going to come from the line of Erinn Murphy with Piper Sandler.\nErinn Murphy: Question is around the landscape where in North America we've seen some pretty unique partnerships recently with [indiscernible]. Are you expecting to participate in these partnerships? I know historically math hasn\u2019t been that appealing but maybe with ultra target structure what's coming your brand expense? And then I guess secondly if you think about the post behavior of consumer retailer post pandemic, how comfortable are you with the entirety of this brand portfolio today if that ever makes sense? Thank you.\nFabrizio Freda: So I didn\u2019t understand the second question.\nErinn Murphy: Are there any brands thinking of the makeup portfolio in particular that you would ever consider investing on the other side of the pandemic. I am just curious on your comfort with the entirety of the portfolio today?\nFabrizio Freda: So the first answer is yes, we are working with our partners and discussing the ultra target and the calls opportunities as you said as part of your question. This will depend on which brands in our portfolio these two opportunities may fit different brands in our portfolio and so we are evaluating these with our partners and we are considering participation by brand to these activities and this could be a driver of future acceleration of the COVID in North America as well, importantly to underline these two opportunities are both brick-and-mortar and online and so obviously it will be very important also to been able to manage the online part of that opportunity. In term of the portfolio of brands, we continuously look at our portfolio. We look at our portfolio for efficiency and we open with Dundee's already in the past to rationalization decisions in our portfolio meaning closing brands that for a good reason do not -- cannot sustain the long-term investments and we continue looking into acquisitions an opportunity for reinforcing our portfolio in areas where we have strategic opportunities or strategic apps. So this is a continuous process and during COVID this is continuing.\nOperator: And our next question is going to come from the line of Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer.\nRupesh Parikh: So Fabrizio I had a question just on your China business, I was curious what you're seeing right now in the makeup category in China?\nFabrizio Freda: Yeah the makeup category in China is stronger than makeup in the other regions because as I say responded to broader social locations and the user locations, but it's still decline, so is not different than the rest of the world China meaning skincare is very, very strong, fragrance is accelerating and makeup is large even in China however, on a completely different proportion because when you see -- when you think of this nature just gave before that makeup is completely correlate to the location of user in China because of the good control of COVID and because of the occasions like business offices are open, people are shopping more regularly, brick-and-mortar shopping is more present in most of the cities. Because of these more occasions makeup is in better shape but still is the lag between the categories and mostly in China I'd say from our consumer understanding is because of mask waving meaning China is better controlling COVID but also better controlling COVID because there is very disciplined mask wearing and mask wearing also is the reason for less use of makeup. So stronger than the rest of the world but still not as strong as it will be after COVID and post COVID where we assume there will be or expect that will be a strong recovery on makeup also in China.\nOperator: Our next question is going to come from the line of Nik Modi with RBC.\nNik Modi: Fabrizio, I wanted to go back on the online discussions, you guys have done a great job with analytics and understanding consumer behavior and given how much migration has occurred on one, I'm just curious what your data and research and analytics are saying about the stickiness. For instance, you talk about the very mature consumers and developed markets migrating online, how strictly do you think that behavior will be I think that will be an important discussion going forward given the margin differential between online and some of the other channels, thank you.\nFabrizio Freda: It's a very good question and again our point of view this will be very sticky because the people shopping online and obviously some of them are shopping online because the brick-and-mortar were closed for showing the case of luxury, but they're lacking it and we see all the statistics, all the data telling us they are enjoying the skills. For example, our loyalty programs are working better and better and we have more loyalty program as we discussed and they're getting expanded and the level of loyalty is going up and the re-pastures rate meaning they're coming, that is going up. Then we see conversions very strong and traffic increasing and there are ways where the conversion will be driven will be maintained after. The most important of the investment we're doing in order to maintain conversion also after COVID is the high touch services transfer online. So the chart with the consultants, digital try on, the live streaming opportunities, the use of our particularly the brand.com in this case also has media platform because we see that the time that the consumers are spending on online is increasing dramatically because when the digital try-on service, the possibility to consult, they spend more time and this time is time of disposure to our equity messages. So this is media value, this is really media value meaning we have more than half billion consumers coming on our site and more in this moment and then imagine that they stay nine minutes and they say if we're to buy media to speak to half a billion consumers for nine minutes this will be a huge cost while building place is another benefit of our selling operations. So there is a lot of value in these high touch services. What they will do is they will increase differentiation of our sites from us. They will increase traffic because people are coming not only to buy product for the services and will maintain or possibly farther increase conversion after COVID and then finally will increase the value of our online as media value and so this is a very positive view for the long-term. Obviously we believe that there is a lot of consumer that will continue to shop also in brick-and-mortar after COVID and there is no one consumer there is only online, only brick-and-mortar. I believe the consumer would love the omnichannel speed particularly after COVID they will be anxious to get a gain to brick-and-mortar experience, so they will come back and that's why we are building around these realities this expectation, imagine better omnichannel platform where the consumer will be able to choose the percentage of time or the speed in online and how much they want in brick-and-mortar and that will navigate and on the two channels in new ways. I believe that companies that will have brands that will have a good omnichannel model in the future will have a competitive advantage.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America.\nOlivia Tong: First just a clarification, Tracey I believe you said that you were adding additional production capacity, so just curious what categories, what regions you were looking at for that and then my question is really around the margin progression especially given this quarter. So I think that's the highest quarterly operating margin you\u2019ve achieved, there is a couple of companies. So realizing of course that there is a lot of more and more expenditures that are coming right now, but as you think about second half long-term, are there things you burn over the course of almost 12 months now on areas you can come back -- cut back on spend more permanently or are there areas where you have to just push even harder and as you think about specifically for Q3 what's planned in Q3 because while you're looking for margin expansion, it looks like it would only imply about similar to what you achieved in fiscal Q2 despite COVID obviously now entering the base. Thank you.\nTracey Travis: So regarding our production capacity as you\u2019ve seen from our results over the last couple of quarters, clearly where we have been in need and have been investing in terms of production capacity is in skincare and we have invested in North America, we've invested in Europe and as you heard us announce this morning in our prepared remarks, we are also investing in a new facility in Asia to support primarily skincare and there will be some makeup primarily foundation as we're thinking right now in Asia. So very much having capacity closer to where our strong demand growth is will be a real benefit to us and we're looking, were certainly looking forward to that. As it relates to the margin, I would as I said in my prepared remarks Olivia, we had done an excellent job of controlling cost last year once the pandemic hit. Many of those cost controls were temporary controls. When you think about the management salary reductions, some of the rent abatements that we got, given the fact that our stores were closed, some of the furloughing benefit and some of the other back on we controlled headcount, TV, etcetera. So selling terms of the learning going forward, clearly there are some areas of I'd say more discretionary cost as we emerge out of the pandemic that we will continue to control, but the long-term sustainable cost controls really come from our cost saving programs. That's where the permanence, more sustainable cost take up comes from. So that's the reason why you're seeing if you think about what we said last year in terms of our cost programs and the significant amount of management that we did in the third and the fourth quarter to control costs given the fact that all of our brick-and-mortar doors over the course ended up closing that some of those costs certainly will be back in the second half in the third and the fourth quarter. But we will continue to manage costs in a disciplined way as we have up to this point.\nOperator: Our next question is going to come from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities.\nChris Carey: So I just wanted to follow up on the operating margin question, I think it's important EMEA strongest margin we've seen, fragrances I think strongest margin we've seen and from just hearing the answer to that question, it sound like there was -- there has been a lot of efforts around cost savings, but certainly the channel dynamic as well with EMEA online doubling and certainly you\u2019ve seen strengthen in skincare in Asia and so I'm just wondering how much the margin improvement actually might be more sustainable over time from channel mix standpoint?\nTracey Travis: Absolutely, we have tailwind as it relates to margin given both our category mix growth as well as our channel mix growth. We do have obviously a fairly large footprint of brick-and-mortar that right now given where traffic is, is a bit of a drag on our margin performance and obviously we're addressing that and we will see once the pandemic is behind us and traffic returns, how fast it returns and in the meantime obviously we're taking some actions but we are very comfortable that we have margin progression ahead of us once the pandemic is behind on in a more sustainable way, especially given the tailwinds that we have to your point Chris.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse.\nMichael Binetti: I do want to follow that Tracey, at the Analyst Day, you walked us through a margin that was well into the high teens on what you knew on the business there as we look around at some of the businesses that I'd say are probably the closest in comparison to yours, we see some with some of the two on the operating margin. Obviously you\u2019ve made structural changes that a few of the other analysts have run through, but you're going to end up in a bigger travel business, bigger digital business, bigger China business closing some stores that were a drag. Do you see over the very long term 10 years can this business move into the 20s on margin?\nTracey Travis: It's again over the very long term, so look I'd say that certainly that is something that we are targeting, given all of our -- again given the tailwind in terms of channel growth and category growth might change obviously makeup might we believe makeup will recover and we're certainly going to support it to recover and the margins will improve on makeup as well. Makeup actually is the category that has the biggest penetration of freestanding stores and brick-and-mortar. So it is a category that is particularly challenged from a margin standpoint in this particular environment. But certainly Michael, everything that we're doing from a business management standpoint and from a cost management standpoint would get us in that North Star of 20%.\nMichael Binetti: And so to follow that, you\u2019ve seen some really strong growth in time and it's come up a bit in the last two calls. We see something regularly even as recently this week, government is going to allow consumer shipments home versus physical pickup in the past. So it seems like there is more and more friction coming out of that process and a lot of square footage is going to be added there. Does island change your travel retail business even after global economies reopened and change your outlook on travel and the Chinese domestic consumer?\nFabrizio Freda: Yes now as I said before, our travel retail business in the short term is really driven by Asia in general and China domestic in particular within China domestic, China is the star and is driven by the new traffic and by the increased conversion and by the quantities past just because of the regulations that you just explained and by the developmental of retail. So those are all very important long-term strengths of the channel which is developing. Now when the normal travel will and will never be normal except, but the new normal travel stated after COVID and you are this progress of the domestic travel in China, the international travel in America and Europe within the rest of Asia and the Chinese consumer will go back travelling the world and that's obviously their desire one of the biggest aspiration shoot to the consumer when I look to the consumer opinions and research for the long-term. So when there will be a combination of the stated international travel with stronger domestic travel model that has been developed during this period, this will make still one of the most important long term channels of opportunity -- full of opportunities and again the biggest opportunity remain technically driving conversion. So the conversion of travelers into bias and the retail, so the possibility of buying also without queuing in a store for a long time where you need to take a plane I think, those two elements are big drivers of the future travel retail independently from the short-term management of the cash. And in term of the China overall business, we do monitor Chinese consumers. We spoke to it last time. This time our Chinese business between quarter one and quarter two is basically double the level of growth our China mainland business. Our TR business has also accelerate but not as strong as the China Mainland business which was driven by amazing online events like 1111 during the November period. And so the combination of the development of online within China the sudden brick-and-mortar in China is still double-digit in quarter two was growing double-digit showing the potential of brick-and-mortar when COVID is more managed or will be more manageable and then travel retail continues to do very well and so when look is also to our total Chinese consumer consumption bringing altogether what is domestic travel retail and Mainland China we still see an acceleration in total from quarter one to quarter two and so we believe this is a very, very strong potentially. We're working to manage it in a way which is still building equity of our brands, still protecting every single one of our partners been able to do good business with us for the long-term and that's our goal and we are working on it.\nOperator: And our last question is going to come from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel.\nMark Astrachan: Maybe just follow-up and one other question, so just on online where does did that settle as a percentage of the category sales post pandemic and how do you think about retention of those incremental consumers on reseller.com versus your own brand.com. I've seen for you all and then just quickly, holistically I am thinking about your guidance on a go forward basis, are big events like 618 and 1111 becoming more important in driving your business meaning that the June quarter might be a little bit bigger than its historical level. Same thing for the December quarter and to that part can you explain kind of why we saw somewhat weaker September quarter guidance and I think maybe people had expected the time is same for the March quarter today. Thank you.\nTracey Travis: Let me talk about the key shopping moments, absolutely particularly in the holiday period as you recall last year in the second quarter we had a 16% growth in constant currency, very much driven by key events that that are in the second quarter. The fourth quarter 618 did quite a bit actually less meaningful to the quarter than certainly 1111, but we are seeing concentration in some of those events and certainly that be in terms of our expectation on sales really flowed through to the bottom line in the second quarter.\nFabrizio Freda: Brand.com, online is different channels, they are brand.com, retail.com, pure play and third-party platform, which we did find that the chemo model and so these channels have different level of developments by counties and this is the results of consumer preferences and historical development of the channel. So it's not that we're driving. We're driving all of them and particularly we work with our retail partners very close to drive their retail.com, which is most of the times doing very well, particularly in this period but also for the long-term. So for example in China, retail.com is very limited and white brand.com and most importantly, third-party platform is the most developed while in the US, retail.com is very, very strong and we see a lot of great developments recently in the retail.com of our key partners and this also serves in this moment as a mitigating factor to the brick-and-mortar issues of productivity that we've discussed before. So we will continue develop each one of these channels and is the consumer deciding where to go and obviously we talked with each one of our retail partners to do the best possible job in every channel.\nOperator: Thank you.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Fabrizio Freda",
            "content": "Thank you, Rainey and hello everyone. Let me first with that each of you are in good health and that your  families are well. Our hearts continue to be with those impacted by COVID-19 and our focus remains first and foremost on the health and safety of our employees, their families and our consumers. To our employees, you have lifted us up from caring for the physical and emotional wellbeing of colleagues to make in-hand sanitizer, seeking opportunities to support charities around the world, generously contributing to LCK [ph] employee relief fund and so much more. In December the company made an addition donation to the employees' fund and we continue to make progress on our citizenship and social impact commitments. Our employee's agility and creativity empower the company to deliver the exceptional results we announced today. For the second quarter in fiscal year 2021, sales rose 3% a 12 point positive swing from the decline of 9% in the first quarter. Impressively time brands grew led by the double-digit growth from Este\u0301e Lauder and La Mer as well as great performance from Jo Malone London. Le Labo and Fre\u0301de\u0301ric Malle also rose double-digits. We focus our investment decisions on engines of growth while employing strict cost discipline in other areas delivering strong double-digit adjusted diluted earnings per share growth. In the quarter we faced increasing complexity from the pandemic, yet still delivered the results that exceeded our record second quarter of fiscal year 2020 when sales grew, the strongest in 20 years in our seasonally largest quarter. Our multiple engines of growth strategy continued to prove its value, enabling us to pivot with a GDP in this challenging moment. We successfully activated efforts behind the growth engines of skincare, fragrance, Asia-Pacific, travel retail in Asia and global online. Our skincare category performance extraordinarily. It's accelerating growth reflected the strong locally relevant innovation, successful year strategies, compelling ingredient narrative and deeper consumer relationships enabled by sophisticated data and analytics. Growth of our high repeat Hero products was broad based across sub categories from cleanses to watery lotion, serum, eye care and moisturizers. Our skin care business has continued to grow from strength to strength, bolstered by the teaser mind of the ritual of skincare as an expression of healthcare. From entry prestige to luxury, our brands excelled in skincare. Many brands contributed demonstrating the breadth of our performance. Dr. Jart provided incremental sales from our double-digit organic growth, we did appealing brand positioning. The Este\u0301e Lauder brand once again delivered double-digit growth across several of these Hero franchises in skincare. It's new advanced narrative serum was a powerful force, thanks to its new formula, a luxurious, more sustainable glass bottle. The serum delivered a healthy fit to Advanced Night Repair eye and these two Hero products benefited from their synergies and desirable sets. The brands revitalizing supreme franchise accelerated significantly, gaining momentum with its Hero moisturizer. La Mer leadership in luxury skincare group as consumers demand for its iconic products with powerful proven secrecy sort. Here two serum was a vibrant sub category. It's new debt concentrate was a big contributor to growth, amplifying trends of Hero like Van De La Mer and the treatment lotion. The new Genaissance de La Mer concentrated night balm performed exceptionally well, driving the brand's ultra luxury franchise to new highs. Clinique returned to growth lifted by skincare as it's Hero franchises that are focused on how to solve skincare problems like acme and dark spot, even better clinical interrupter is now firmly established as a core performance of the brand and continues to deliver significant growth. It was complimented by an acceleration in the brand's three-step product and acne solution lines. Our luxury and our seasonal fragrances captivated consumer desires for Tone for Beauty, Joe Malone London, Le Labo, Fre\u0301de\u0301ric Malle and Kilian Paris innovations in iconic products were both highly sold. These brands all delivered stellar online sales growth along with improving brick-and-mortar sales in certain markets. Joe Malone London and Le Labo home products continue to flourish as consumer crave the sense to alleviate the sanctuary of their homes. Our global online channel delivered outstanding double-digit sales growth, significantly accelerated from the previous quarter and driven by every region. Growth was robust across the board as brand.com third party platforms, pure play and retail.com all contributed meaningfully. Our go to market strategies for each of these were tremendously successful, particularly during Black Friday, Fiber Week and [indiscernible] 1111 Global Shopping festival, driving strong consumer acquisition and retention. We continue to enhance our brand sites with high catch services. These strategies -- these strategic investments are elevating the consumer experience from convenience buying to enriched shopping, completely useful tools, targeted recommendation and expert advice. Across our brands, we are uniquely combining technology and data with our talented youth advisor on a global scale. Digital is proving to be incredibly powerful, driving over twice the engagement as well as higher conversion and retention rates. In the quarter, we added digital try [ph] to more sites around the world. The number of sessions nearly doubled from the pre quarter, reflecting both the expansion to additional sites as well as big uptick in activity on brand site that had previously launched it. Digital chat is also proving to be very impactful. In North America conversion of live chat session is nearly four times higher than average conversion in the market. Digital chat usage accelerated during the holiday season as our skilled beauty advisor offered useful insights and customized education to consumers, driving much higher basket site than average. Our brands are increasingly offsetting other engaging digital services and the experienced. Two examples are found on Clinique.com. Clinique Reality, the brand skin agnostic tool extracts the consumer in a highly personalized manner, driving notably strong conversion rates and Clinique Skin School addresses the growing demand for credible education in an entertaining format with a new focus on real-time interactions. Skin School brilliantly integrates live chat and trend-based programming with a brand expert consultant. We continue to pursue high touch innovation online as evidenced by the Este\u0301e Lauder brand new AI driven product recommendations based on real-time consumer behavior and past preferences that we're piloting in North America. We anticipate that these dynamic merchandising holds great promise and are excited to scale in this year for Este\u0301e Lauder as well for other brands. We are welcoming new consumers on our brand sites, but also successfully driving repeat enable in part by our loyalty programs. In the first half of fiscal year 2021, the number of loyalty programs members who both rose strong double-digits driven by travel digit growth of international loyalty program members. In so many ways, we are building deeper relationship with our consumers. Our brands delivered excellent results for [indiscernible] 1111 Global shopping Festival leveraging the latest live streaming technology and capabilities to generate product discovery. For 1111 the Este\u0301e Lauder brand moved into the number one rank in beauty. La Mer notched number one rank in luxury beauty. Mac was the number one prestige make up brand and Jo Malone London was the leader in fragrance. We have long believed in the compelling growth prospects of online and had been investing in it for more than two decades. At the onset of COVID-19, we nearly doubled our rate of online investment, including accelerating our consumer facing investment like digital, social selling, Omni channel or loyalty programs. We're also increasing our investment in our digital infrastructure and fulfillment network to meet the much higher traffic and demand. In addition to these capital investments, we continue to optimize our advertising investment in digital channels as well as invest in our great online talent domestically in our headquarters in New York and in our local markets around the world. I'm on the regions, Asia-Pacific delivered the strongest sequential improvement with sales growth accelerating from 7% to 27%. Mainland China prospered while Korea and several smaller markets contributed organically. In Mainland China momentum in brick-and-mortar carried into the quarter with sales again growing double-digit. Online accelerated significantly, elevated by a remarkable 1111 event. Nearly every brand grew as across Le brands we reached more consumers, thanks to locally relevant innovation Hero products, rich storytelling and successful influencer activations, as well as the dedication and creativity of the local team in China. Travel retail grew single-digit organically driven by strong results in Asia, particularly in Heinen as we fulfilled the desires of the travelling Chinese consumers with a deal merchandizing. Traffic to Heinen continued to rebound and duty free annual partial limit had increased threefold there in July, providing a favorable benefit in the quarter as consumers saw to spend to the new annual limit before year-end. Conversion was also a strong driver, owing prepaid, which newly offered live streaming. Across channels, demand from Chinese consumers accelerated, especially in skincare and fragrance. The long-term growth opportunity we foresee in the dynamic Asia-Pacific region rebounded. Over the last fixed demands despite the challenges of the pandemic we made three significant investment commitments as we strive to best meet the desires of Chinese and Asian consumers. In late 2019, we acquired the Korean based skincare brand Dr. Jart, while in nearly 2020, we committed to build an end to end innovation center in Shanghai. Today I'm pleased to confer we're building a state of art manufacturing facility near Tokyo. We're on track to open our Shanghai innovation center in spring 2022. This will increase our local capabilities in product design and formulation. We're also strengthening our consumer insight and trend analytics in this vibrant market. We broke ground in our new manufacturing facility near Tokyo, which is to be operational in late 2022. It will enable us to better meet demand and increase speed to market in the region. The facility will house advanced technologies and engineering achievement, with high standards of sustainability and safety and will be designed to promote flexible and leading-edge working environment. Across our engines, innovation contributed significantly in the second quarter ahead of our aggressive goals driven by focus on fewer bigger and better Hero innovations. We have an enticing pipeline of new product launches for the remainder of our fiscal year. Already our are two in skincare, the Este\u0301e Lauder brand launched supreme bright. It addresses the trend of bright in Asia and is also highly relevant for consumers of old skin tones around the world with it's even better skin tone, dark spot benefits meeting top needs of the multiethnic consumers. Clinique introduced monster sewage search one handed hour with an exclusive deal that provides hydration that goes 10 layers deep into skin surface and also lasts 100 hours even after you wash your face. In the Clinique launched even better clinical serum foundation a weightless liquid foundation with 24 hours ware, a good for skin ingredients to have visibly improving skin instantly and over time. Our strategic focus and investment in our ESG goals remain of utmost importance for us in our key stakeholders and we continue to advance our work in the quarter. Let me share a few examples in sustainable ingredients in packaging and inclusion and diversity for the many areas of our recent progress. We're pleased to have joined CDPs 2020 Climate A list having been awarded the highest score of A. In January Aveda proudly announced that its products are bigger as a mission driven brand this was a natural step for Aveda, a brand that continuously works to reduce its environmentally but while also responding to the fast-growing consumer trends. Our brands are employing more innovative and sustainable packaging as they launch new products while also improving the packaging of existing products, the two new Clinique products, which I just described two such example of innovation launching in more sustainable package. To continue to invest in, in advance our diverse talent, we created a sponsorship program for equitable advance and professional development of our black talent from every chair leadership development program will ensure that our black employees have the support and focus of senior executives and equitable access to leadership training, mentorship and career development opportunities. In closing we delivered excellent performance amid the pandemic, leveraging the strength of our multiple engines of growth strategy, Hero products and robust innovation. We did this while leading our values as we increasingly embedded ESG in everything we do, focusing on safety and wellbeing of our employees, making progress on our environment goals, enacting on our racial equity commitments. We also invested in technology and data for new capabilities to support accelerating growth drivers. These accomplishments and actions give us confidence that we are well-positioned to continue to drive recovery and return to our long-term growth targets after the period of recovery. I'm incredibly grateful to our employees whose grace and fortitude are making us a better company throughout this very difficult moment. While the road ahead will still be challenging together we can be optimistic that brighter days are coming. I wish each one of you good health. And now, I'll turn the call over to Tracy. Okay. So first of all, the key drivers for us let's go one by one, skincare very sustainable. The consumers always were more and more enthusiastic for skincare. We have an amazing pipeline innovation for the future years and the strengths of Asia and particularly of China is internal mix one of the biggest builder of skincare because the penetration of skincare, the penetration of beauty for skincare in Asia is very, very high. So we assume the skincare strengths will continue after COVID. The other driver is China and the potential of China as we explained very well at our Investor Day is for the long-term. The Chinese -- the demographic arrived the potential of the smaller cities of tier three and tier four cities will continue to grow. The power of online and offline distribution will continue to be very strong. In TR imagine that the TR growth today, the TR results are mainly driven by Asia and particularly by the domestic travel acceleration within China. So in the future, the domestic travel acceleration within China will continue, but the international travel will be reinstated and so this will be a father acceleration in the long-term when COVID will abate. So all our key drivers are really here for the long-term and most importantly as you know, our drivers tend to be accretive in profitability. So they will clear resources over time. The lager is a brick-and-mortar particularly in the West. Now this obviously in the short term is an issue because there is a lack of traffic and the lack of traffic has created issues of productivity but also on this one, we are working for rebuilding this for the long-term and so what is a drag today, a big drag on what is about one third of our business is still in brick-and-mortar in the West and so you should imagine that the traffic post COVID will come back that there are all the retailer closures that Tracy summarized, which are happening that will reduce the amount of stores which not be sustainable in the long term and our business acceleration program, which is really putting that right sizing if you want all the channel for us rebuilding productivity over time. And so the combination of traffic closures and business acceleration program is our answer to in the long term after COVID been able to make also brick-and-mortar a gain and engines of growth, which will be profitable in building the company for the long-term. So we are very positive in summary on the continuous trends post COVID of our drivers, new accelerated drivers and we are working to make also what is a drag in the short-term rebuilt as a positive long-term channel which is the brick-and-mortar in the West. Internal makeup was the last part of your question, makeup is very much driven by user locations. So user location meaning to going to the office, going out for dinner, having etcetera. So clearly the makeup category growth will be associated with the post recovery and we will be ready for that. Our point of view is that when the user location will go back into the lives of people, the recovery will be fast and steep and so we are ready for that. Now if when do we assume this will happen frankly, the answer is difficult to answer the same way Tracey explained is difficult to answer, when vaccination all the rest will have a full impact, but we believe that from what we see in the market just casting the full of 2021, we could see beginning of certain usage location to the established because of this makeup growth with follow back in our opinion starting from that moment particularly. So first of all the online business has done very well this quarter plus 60% globally and is interesting we are growing double or triple digit in every brand, every region, every channel, a meaningful channel brand.com, retail.com, third party platform pure plays and so Western Europe is the same. Western Europe is growing depending by market double-digit or triple digit in online and obviously the holiday season has been because of the lockdown as you know in Western Europe particularly COVID was pretty high in November, December. Because of this, the brick-and-mortar were closed in countries like the UK as an example, December was a super difficult month and so it was no regular Christmas holidays in brick-and-mortar and obviously UK was not the only place and so because of this we were able to pivot to online in an historical way. I think our teams have done an amazing work in taking care of our consumer online when they were because of proven behavior for COVID now going into the brick-and-mortar and what we've seen that this works in many, many cases meaning again the consumer's certain categories we're working because of repeat meaning the consumer didn't do without their preferred Le Mer cream or their preferred advanced whatever and so we got a lot of the selling via the online channel. But also we are able to stick to their gifting habits and we created gifting opportunities and delivering all those for gifting etcetera. So it was a lot of activity and invention in this area. Now this online in general, I believe the online will continue to be very strong also in the long-term and this acceleration will continue also post COVID and one of the reason for that which is particularly true in Western Europe is that the new online focus created growth online, more than created new consumers including more mature consumers. Online particularly in Europe was really dedicated to millennial or younger consumers while during COVID, more mature consumers came online and they're lacking it and they're becoming loyal and so they will also post COVID have a bigger percentage of their shopping online than before. On top of this, if you think that we are adding high touch services online, so what were the services that in before were available in brick-and-mortar now gradually but they're also available online and we've been able to scale the speed online. Just to give you a number to understand our ability to scale new ideas is today digital try [ph] is already available in 90% of our brand.com sales internal coverage. Now imagine that that it was not even close to that six months ago and so the consumer responded to that and this is driving also in Western Europe a lot of online and probably sustainable and more loyalty online across different group of consumers. So online had a big role in Western Europe in quarter two and will continue to have a bigger and growing role over time in the next years. So I didn't understand the second question. So the first answer is yes, we are working with our partners and discussing the ultra target and the calls opportunities as you said as part of your question. This will depend on which brands in our portfolio these two opportunities may fit different brands in our portfolio and so we are evaluating these with our partners and we are considering participation by brand to these activities and this could be a driver of future acceleration of the COVID in North America as well, importantly to underline these two opportunities are both brick-and-mortar and online and so obviously it will be very important also to been able to manage the online part of that opportunity. In term of the portfolio of brands, we continuously look at our portfolio. We look at our portfolio for efficiency and we open with Dundee's already in the past to rationalization decisions in our portfolio meaning closing brands that for a good reason do not -- cannot sustain the long-term investments and we continue looking into acquisitions an opportunity for reinforcing our portfolio in areas where we have strategic opportunities or strategic apps. So this is a continuous process and during COVID this is continuing. Yeah the makeup category in China is stronger than makeup in the other regions because as I say responded to broader social locations and the user locations, but it's still decline, so is not different than the rest of the world China meaning skincare is very, very strong, fragrance is accelerating and makeup is large even in China however, on a completely different proportion because when you see -- when you think of this nature just gave before that makeup is completely correlate to the location of user in China because of the good control of COVID and because of the occasions like business offices are open, people are shopping more regularly, brick-and-mortar shopping is more present in most of the cities. Because of these more occasions makeup is in better shape but still is the lag between the categories and mostly in China I'd say from our consumer understanding is because of mask waving meaning China is better controlling COVID but also better controlling COVID because there is very disciplined mask wearing and mask wearing also is the reason for less use of makeup. So stronger than the rest of the world but still not as strong as it will be after COVID and post COVID where we assume there will be or expect that will be a strong recovery on makeup also in China. It's a very good question and again our point of view this will be very sticky because the people shopping online and obviously some of them are shopping online because the brick-and-mortar were closed for showing the case of luxury, but they're lacking it and we see all the statistics, all the data telling us they are enjoying the skills. For example, our loyalty programs are working better and better and we have more loyalty program as we discussed and they're getting expanded and the level of loyalty is going up and the re-pastures rate meaning they're coming, that is going up. Then we see conversions very strong and traffic increasing and there are ways where the conversion will be driven will be maintained after. The most important of the investment we're doing in order to maintain conversion also after COVID is the high touch services transfer online. So the chart with the consultants, digital try on, the live streaming opportunities, the use of our particularly the brand.com in this case also has media platform because we see that the time that the consumers are spending on online is increasing dramatically because when the digital try-on service, the possibility to consult, they spend more time and this time is time of disposure to our equity messages. So this is media value, this is really media value meaning we have more than half billion consumers coming on our site and more in this moment and then imagine that they stay nine minutes and they say if we're to buy media to speak to half a billion consumers for nine minutes this will be a huge cost while building place is another benefit of our selling operations. So there is a lot of value in these high touch services. What they will do is they will increase differentiation of our sites from us. They will increase traffic because people are coming not only to buy product for the services and will maintain or possibly farther increase conversion after COVID and then finally will increase the value of our online as media value and so this is a very positive view for the long-term. Obviously we believe that there is a lot of consumer that will continue to shop also in brick-and-mortar after COVID and there is no one consumer there is only online, only brick-and-mortar. I believe the consumer would love the omnichannel speed particularly after COVID they will be anxious to get a gain to brick-and-mortar experience, so they will come back and that's why we are building around these realities this expectation, imagine better omnichannel platform where the consumer will be able to choose the percentage of time or the speed in online and how much they want in brick-and-mortar and that will navigate and on the two channels in new ways. I believe that companies that will have brands that will have a good omnichannel model in the future will have a competitive advantage. Yes now as I said before, our travel retail business in the short term is really driven by Asia in general and China domestic in particular within China domestic, China is the star and is driven by the new traffic and by the increased conversion and by the quantities past just because of the regulations that you just explained and by the developmental of retail. So those are all very important long-term strengths of the channel which is developing. Now when the normal travel will and will never be normal except, but the new normal travel stated after COVID and you are this progress of the domestic travel in China, the international travel in America and Europe within the rest of Asia and the Chinese consumer will go back travelling the world and that's obviously their desire one of the biggest aspiration shoot to the consumer when I look to the consumer opinions and research for the long-term. So when there will be a combination of the stated international travel with stronger domestic travel model that has been developed during this period, this will make still one of the most important long term channels of opportunity -- full of opportunities and again the biggest opportunity remain technically driving conversion. So the conversion of travelers into bias and the retail, so the possibility of buying also without queuing in a store for a long time where you need to take a plane I think, those two elements are big drivers of the future travel retail independently from the short-term management of the cash. And in term of the China overall business, we do monitor Chinese consumers. We spoke to it last time. This time our Chinese business between quarter one and quarter two is basically double the level of growth our China mainland business. Our TR business has also accelerate but not as strong as the China Mainland business which was driven by amazing online events like 1111 during the November period. And so the combination of the development of online within China the sudden brick-and-mortar in China is still double-digit in quarter two was growing double-digit showing the potential of brick-and-mortar when COVID is more managed or will be more manageable and then travel retail continues to do very well and so when look is also to our total Chinese consumer consumption bringing altogether what is domestic travel retail and Mainland China we still see an acceleration in total from quarter one to quarter two and so we believe this is a very, very strong potentially. We're working to manage it in a way which is still building equity of our brands, still protecting every single one of our partners been able to do good business with us for the long-term and that's our goal and we are working on it. Brand.com, online is different channels, they are brand.com, retail.com, pure play and third-party platform, which we did find that the chemo model and so these channels have different level of developments by counties and this is the results of consumer preferences and historical development of the channel. So it's not that we're driving. We're driving all of them and particularly we work with our retail partners very close to drive their retail.com, which is most of the times doing very well, particularly in this period but also for the long-term. So for example in China, retail.com is very limited and white brand.com and most importantly, third-party platform is the most developed while in the US, retail.com is very, very strong and we see a lot of great developments recently in the retail.com of our key partners and this also serves in this moment as a mitigating factor to the brick-and-mortar issues of productivity that we've discussed before. So we will continue develop each one of these channels and is the consumer deciding where to go and obviously we talked with each one of our retail partners to do the best possible job in every channel."

            "name": "Tracey Travis",
            "content": "Thank you, Fabrizio and I certainly echo your comments regarding our wonderful employees. As a reminder, my commentary today is adjusted for the items that Renee mentioned at the beginning of the call and net sales growth numbers are in constant currency. Our net sales rose 3% in the second quarter. The COVID-19 pandemic continue to pressure traffic in our brick-and-mortar distribution, but sales declines in stores were entirely offset by strong growth across our online channels and in travel retail in Asia. The December 2019 acquisition of Dr. Jar added approximately three point to net sales growth. Sales performed above our expectations in large part reflecting the outstanding execution during the annual team 1111 Shopping festival as well as the many activations our brands deployed during key shopping events like Brett Black Friday and Fiber Week. In addition to the acceleration and growth we saw in skincare, fragrance sales were strong in the quarter and home fragrance continued to resonate during the pandemic. Our gross margin increased 10 basis points compared to last year's second quarter. Favorable channel mix was driven by the growth in our online sales and also reflects lower costs for testers in our brick-and-mortar distribution. From a category perspective, the acceleration of sales in skincare also benefited gross margin. The positive mix was partially offset by higher obsolescence and a negative currency impact. Operating expenses improved by 160 basis points as a percent of sales, reflecting both the strength of our sales leverage during key shopping moments and our cost containment measures. Many of our COVID related cost containment measures remained in place during the quarter and contributed to our improved profitability along with the benefits of our leading beauty forward initiative. Lower selling cost and other in-store promotion cost also reflected the mix shift of our business from brick-and-mortar to online as well as some remaining government subsidies in certain countries. Given the challenged environment, we continue to experience periodic tour closures. Partially offsetting the cost favorability was higher investment behind our strategic priorities, including China, online and digital technology as well as the inclusion of Dr. Jart expenses this year. As a result, our operating margin rose 170 basis points to 24.3%, a significant accomplishment during this important holiday quarter considering the record results achieved in the year ago period. Our effective tax rate for the quarter came in at 15.9%. The lower tax rate for the quarter was primarily due to the recognition of a onetime retroactive benefit related to recently finalized guilty US tax rate regulation. We now expect our effective tax rate for the year to be approximately 20% reflecting this development. Diluted EPS of $2.61 increased 24% compared to the prior year. EPS was higher than expected due primarily to the combination of strong performance during the key shopping moments in the quarter and the lower tax rate while maintaining strict cost management. This performance is truly a testament to our team's ability to navigate the business through the difficult macroenvironment. Our plans under the post-COVID business acceleration program are progressing. Through the past six months, we've taken charges of $46 million primarily to close underperforming freestanding retail stores in our EMEA region and an employee-related cost as we align resources to support our online business and our digital capabilities. As the program continues in the second half we expect to continue to rationalize our retail footprint primarily in Western market. Additionally, we took an $81 million impairment charge for our glam glove brand reflecting the COVID-related disruption of the brand growth plans and lower than expected growth from its planned geographic expansion. During the first half of our fiscal year, we generated $1.98 billion in net cash flows from operating activities, which was substantially above the prior year, due primarily to improvements in working capital management. Accounts payable increased reflecting timing-related items that also support our second-half growth plans and accounts receivable reflected the rapid growth in our direct to consumer business and a five-day improvement in DSO. We invested $250 million in capital expenditures to support key investment areas like additional production capacity and technology. Conversely we spent far less on counters and stores due to lower traffic and brick-and-mortar doors. We ended December with $5.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents just above our total debt. With the strength of our cash position, our free cash flow generation and our confidence in our business drivers as we recover, we expect to reinstate share repurchases and maintain our dividend during the second half of our fiscal year. So now let's turn to our outlook, we are obviously encouraged by the sequential improvement we saw in every region as we continue to manage through the effects of the pandemic. While cases of COVID-19 and the variance of surging again in some markets, resulting in renewed door closures, restrictions and lockdowns, we are optimistic that once the vaccines reach enough of the global population, the restrictions on travel and social activities will ease. Nonetheless we've not assume a second wave. Therefore, the more accelerated global recovery we originally anticipated in our second half has clearly been delayed. So while we are pleased with our performance in the first half, the prolonged uncertainty with respect to the pace and timing of the recovery makes it still difficult to provide sales and EPS guidance for the full year. We do continue to expect sequential, quarterly sales growth improvement as comparisons to the prior year ease and the global recovery unfolds. The inclusion of six months of incremental sales from the acquisition of Dr. Jart, which benefited our growth in the first half adds two percentage points to sales growth for the full fiscal year. As you know, several of our retail customers are liquidating or reducing their store footprints. Notably Lord & Taylor, Staged Stores and [indiscernible] are liquidating and Macy's, Nordstrom [ph] have announced store reductions. Additionally, we expect to close certain freestanding stores in North America and EMEA now that the holidays are behind us. In aggregate, the law sales represent between 1% and 2% of our total full-year sales and we do expect to recapture a portion of those sales in other locations in online. While we will continue to execute our cost savings programs, it is important to recognize that some of the temporary cost measures we took last year will be returning in the coming months. The principal areas of returning cost includes some additional advertising, promotion and point-of-sale employee cost, which were all meaningfully reduced during the time that retail doors were closed last year, as well as the restoration of certain temporary pay reductions we took. Travel and retail consulting costs are expected to ramp up more slowly. Costs will also increase as offices reopen and our facility to continue to implement enhanced safety protocols. We will incur incremental spending for our new Asian manufacturing plant and innovation center and as we continue to see signs of consumer's willingness to resume their normal activities including return to stores, we plan to invest incrementally as we normally did pre-pandemic in our fourth quarter to strongly support our launch programs and begin to reaccelerate our makeup business in the upcoming fiscal year. Looking at the near term, for the third quarter we expect sales to rise between 10% and 11% in constant currency. We have a terrific lineup of product offerings and activations for the Lunar New Year and we expect continued strong online sales. You may recall that we had an exceptional January last year. We have lacked the purchase of Dr. Jart at the beginning of our third quarter and the brand is now part of our organic growth. Currently, is expected to be accretive by approximately three percentage points. Third quarter EPS is expected to be between $1.10 and $1.20 reflecting the sales outlook and a careful balance between cost containment measures and investment in key growth areas such as online and technology and currency is expected to add $0.03 to EPS. We remain optimistic that the pandemic will be controlled and out of home activities will resume under a new normal. With a solid first half behind us, we've proven we can deliver in the context of a difficult macroenvironment while continuing to support our employees, our social and environmental commitment and invest in the capabilities needed to sustain our growth over the long term. The resiliency of our business during this time and the passion and dedication of our teams, reinforce our confidence in our strategy and the continuation of our ability to deliver long-term sustainable growth. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time. So regarding our production capacity as you've seen from our results over the last couple of quarters, clearly where we have been in need and have been investing in terms of production capacity is in skincare and we have invested in North America, we've invested in Europe and as you heard us announce this morning in our prepared remarks, we are also investing in a new facility in Asia to support primarily skincare and there will be some makeup primarily foundation as we're thinking right now in Asia. So very much having capacity closer to where our strong demand growth is will be a real benefit to us and we're looking, were certainly looking forward to that. As it relates to the margin, I would as I said in my prepared remarks Olivia, we had done an excellent job of controlling cost last year once the pandemic hit. Many of those cost controls were temporary controls. When you think about the management salary reductions, some of the rent abatements that we got, given the fact that our stores were closed, some of the furloughing benefit and some of the other back on we controlled headcount, TV, etcetera. So selling terms of the learning going forward, clearly there are some areas of I'd say more discretionary cost as we emerge out of the pandemic that we will continue to control, but the long-term sustainable cost controls really come from our cost saving programs. That's where the permanence, more sustainable cost take up comes from. So that's the reason why you're seeing if you think about what we said last year in terms of our cost programs and the significant amount of management that we did in the third and the fourth quarter to control costs given the fact that all of our brick-and-mortar doors over the course ended up closing that some of those costs certainly will be back in the second half in the third and the fourth quarter. But we will continue to manage costs in a disciplined way as we have up to this point. Absolutely, we have tailwind as it relates to margin given both our category mix growth as well as our channel mix growth. We do have obviously a fairly large footprint of brick-and-mortar that right now given where traffic is, is a bit of a drag on our margin performance and obviously we're addressing that and we will see once the pandemic is behind us and traffic returns, how fast it returns and in the meantime obviously we're taking some actions but we are very comfortable that we have margin progression ahead of us once the pandemic is behind on in a more sustainable way, especially given the tailwinds that we have to your point Chris. It's again over the very long term, so look I'd say that certainly that is something that we are targeting, given all of our -- again given the tailwind in terms of channel growth and category growth might change obviously makeup might we believe makeup will recover and we're certainly going to support it to recover and the margins will improve on makeup as well. Makeup actually is the category that has the biggest penetration of freestanding stores and brick-and-mortar. So it is a category that is particularly challenged from a margin standpoint in this particular environment. But certainly Michael, everything that we're doing from a business management standpoint and from a cost management standpoint would get us in that North Star of 20%. Let me talk about the key shopping moments, absolutely particularly in the holiday period as you recall last year in the second quarter we had a 16% growth in constant currency, very much driven by key events that that are in the second quarter. The fourth quarter 618 did quite a bit actually less meaningful to the quarter than certainly 1111, but we are seeing concentration in some of those events and certainly that be in terms of our expectation on sales really flowed through to the bottom line in the second quarter."

        "content": "Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to The Est\u00e9e Lauder Company's Fiscal 2021 First Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded and webcast. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Rainey Mancini.\nRainey Mancini: Hello. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements. To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges disclosed in our press release. All net sales growth numbers are in constant currency. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP figures in our press release and on the Investors section of our website. As a reminder, references to online sales include sales we make directly to our consumers through Brand.com and through third-party platforms. It also includes estimated sales of our products through our retailer\u2019s websites. During the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question so we can respond to all of you within the time scheduled for this call. And now I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio.\nFabrizio Freda: Thank you, Rainey and hello everyone. I hope that each of you are in good health, as the world continues to confront COVID-19. Our hearts are with those impacted and our focus remains first and foremost, with the safety and well-being of our employees, their families, and our consumers. I continue to be incredibly inspired by our employees' enduring compassion, creativity, and resiliency, you are making us a better company, and I stand my deepest gratitude. Our diversified prestige beauty portfolio of categories, channels, geographies, brands, consumers segments, and price points give us many levers to fuel the business, both in times of prosperity as well as during more challenging times. In this most difficult moment, our multiple engines of growth strategy is invaluable. For the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, sales declined only 9%, a significant sequential improvement, driven by every category. Fragrance and healthcare in particular, had striking progress. Our hero products and innovations thrived and contributed meaningfully to sales. We successfully adjusted our cost structure to minimize the leveraging effects of lower sales, resulting in an operating margin of 20%, very close to the first quarter of last year, when we had double-digit sales growth. In different periods over the last decade, we were driven by different engines, leading to prestige beauty share gains each year and we expect this year to be no different. Since the pandemic began, we estimate that we have grown prestige beauty share globally. On our last earning call, we explained that the growth engines at the moment are the skincare category, the online channel in, Asia-Pacific regions, each delivered terrific performance to begin our new fiscal year. The Est\u00e9e Lauder brand performed exceptionally well, returning to growth in the quarter powered by its hero franchises in skincare. Its Advanced Night Repair franchise delivered very strong double-digit sales growth. Encouragingly, the brand success in skincare was broad based as each of the Re-Nutriv, Revitalizing Supreme, Perfectionist, Micro Essence, nutritious franchises also grew double-digits. This is a remarkable achievement when compared to the brand's very strong skincare performance in the prior year. La Mer had a superb quarter with double-digit sales growth globally, driven by its continued outperformance of luxury skincare growth in Mainland China. The August launch of its new The Concentrate delivered especially strong double-digit sales growth in Asia -- in Asia-Pacific and consumer saw the shooting power of this barrier serum with its new protective antioxidant benefits. Even amidst the pandemic La Mer is welcoming many new consumers, farther demonstrating the irritable appeals of the brand's superior quality. At our last Investor Day, we discussed growth strategies for each of our large, scaling, and developing brands. And even in these challenging times, we are resolute in our focus on all three tiers. The Darphin brand is a beautiful example in the developing tier of a brand succeeding through these perilous times. Darphin contributed to the skincare category growth in the quarter as the successful launch of Intral Rescue Super Concentrate serum amplify the strengths of the brand's hero products. Our acquisition of Dr. Jart with its terrific entry prestige derma brand positioning and desirable hero products enhanced the organic sales growth of skincare. Momentum in the serum watery lotion in eye care subcategories carried into the quarter deriving skincare growth. The August launch of Est\u00e9e Lauder new Advanced Night Repair serum performed extraordinary across geographies and channel aided by compelling activation and an over 40% surge in consumers' reviews since launch when comparing to the entire lifespan of the previous version. Impressively, Clinique even better Clinique interactive serum continues to perform strongly in its third quarter since launch. We deliver outstanding double-digit sales growth online, with skincare, makeup, fragrance, and hair care over prospering. Once again, each of our online channels contributed meaningfully. We continued to strategically invest in our brand sites globally, bringing our classic high-touch services to consumers online. The response has been phenomenal. We are seeing tremendous growth in time spent on for chat, virtual try-on, and shoppable live streams. Even with most retail doors reopen around the world, sales rose 60% organically on our brand sites. We now have virtual try-on across more brands and categories in more markets. In the first quarter alone, we hosted over 1 million virtual try-on sessions globally, with consumer spending more than 30 minutes on average in a session. In North America, the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand launched AI-driven product recommendations based on real-time consumers' behaviors and past preferences. These dynamic merchandising holds great promise across our brands and regions. Clinique global sales growth on Brand.com in the quarter was exceptional among the strongest across the portfolio. Clinique Skin School, on-demand live streaming was a great success, leading to new daily programming that combines top consultants with influences to future holiday sets and favorite Clinique products. Clinique is our first brand to launch new technology that pairs multiple host in one shop about live stream. Bobbi Brown continue to scale its artistry like never before program, expanding visual artistry to include live chat, pre-booked video consultations, master classes, and live streaming by rapidly converting some of its global makeup assets into a network of virtual sellers. Most of the brands markets now offer these consultations on Brand.com, on local social platforms such as WhatsApp, WeChat, and Instagram. These virtual services have a higher conversion rate, up to 10 times the average and a higher average order value. With enticing innovation and engaging new services and tools, commercial grew -- conversion grew strong double-digits across our brand sites, most compelling is the significant conversion growth in markets that are under penetrated online, such as Continental Europe. In the quarter, conversion there grew over 75%, while in Latin America; conversion growth far exceeded 100%. These positions are well for suitable profitable growth online. We invested in online fulfillment during the quarter, strengthening our capacity globally and we are addressing seasonal fulfillment locations in our largest markets in anticipation of robust consumer demand for holiday. Leveraging our investment in technology, we deployed more omnichannel capabilities in several markets. In the U.S., we have seen dramatic uptick in buy online pick up in store format. The brands also partnered with Postmates domestically to launch same-day delivery and open a new experiential store in New York. The store features extensive personalization options for consumers and interactive digital experiences. In these initiatives and more, we are meeting the desires of consumers who are craving convenience and choice, offering them new ways to shop in today's environment. The third engines of growth, Asia-Pacific, also exceled. Several markets contributed to the region high single-digit sales growth, which is most notable as some markets in the region dealt with new waves of COVID-19. Mainland China, Korea, and several smaller markets grew organically. In Mainland China, we continue to invest in the vibrant opportunity of our second home market. We expanded into more cities in the course; reaching over 130. We increased our advertising investment across social and digital platform, showcasing exciting innovation and building brand awareness as we reach new consumers. We continued expanding our talent in anticipation of our new state-of-art innovation center, which will open in Shanghai, as we aim to best meet the needs of Chinese and Asian consumers with local relevancy and local trends, through increased capabilities in product design, formulation, consumer insights, and trend analytics. In Mainland China, the bricks-and-mortar channel returned to double-digit growth, such that both offline and online were powerful growth drivers. The travel retail channels further contributed, driven by tremendous growth in [Indiscernible], partly reflecting increased duty-free purchase limits, the opening of some travel corridors in Asia and online retail growth facilitating higher conversion, magnifying Chinese consumer strengths. Indeed demand from the Chinese consumers was very strong across these channels, most especially in skincare, and we estimate we grew our prestige beauty share. The Fragrance category sales growth accelerated in Asia-Pacific in the quarter. We introduced Kilian Paris and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle in Mainland China, in very select distribution. These unique luxurious brands are proving highly desirable, which coupled with the ongoing strengths of Jo Malone London and Tom Ford drove significant double-digit sales growth of Fragrances. In Korea, Fragrances also soared, Le Labo, new [Indiscernible] fragrances drove meaningful upside, demonstrating the strength of our locally relevant innovation. Around the world, we continue to closely monitor the evolution of consumer attitudes and purchase behavior related to COVID-19. We combine sophisticated social media listening capabilities with machine learning and properly consumer research techniques to develop insights and adapt our marketing and product offering with speed and agility to capture changing trends. Looking ahead, we are confident in the return of growth in the challenged makeup category as the recovery will unfolds. In the meantime, we continue to focus on subcategories in makeup, the favored in the era of masks for COVID-19. In fact, even in lip, which is overall pressured, the liquid lip subcategory is growing naturally driven by M\u00b7A\u00b7C of Power Kiss [ph] liquid lip as consumers sick matte finish formulas that last. Our innovation represented over 30% of sales in the first quarter. We have an exciting pipeline on new product launches for the remainder of fiscal year 2021 for both engines of moment and what we expect to be engines of the future. In October, Clinique launched Moisture Surge Intense Replenishing Hydrator, a new formula that hydrates skin for a full 72 hours in a cream gel formula that dries for drier skin types. This month La Mer will introduce its new [Indiscernible] concentrated night balm, an anti-stress balm, slow crafted with crystal miracle broth that promotes skin natural rebuilding of collagen to help transform the look of skin during sleep. Continuing our progress on sustainability, Origins intend to be the first prestige beauty brand to bring an advanced recycle tube package to market with this Clear Improvement Active Charcoal Mask in 2021. These expands upon Clinique recent launch of all about clean in packaging with most consumer recycled material and plan the right plastic for each tube and most consumer recycled material for its cap. For fiscal year 2021, we continue to expect sequential improvement in sales growth each quarter and to deal global share while prestige beauty progressively returned to growth. We are mindful of the ongoing inputs of COVID-19, most especially the very limited traffic in retail doors, a story open and the second waves occurring in certain markets. We are investing in several strategic priorities intended to drive our long-term sustainable growth that progressive in the word of past call the business acceleration program. For the second quarter, we have magnificent plans for holiday and the 11.11 Global Shopping Festival. Holiday merchandising began a few weeks ago and our brands created rich activations with engaging [Indiscernible] products. Est\u00e9e Lauder LML have kits that include best-selling hero process to drive recruitment. Origin is making holiday gifting easy, offering consumers the ability to text or email a gift, allowing the recipients to either accept or exchange their product before it is gift wrapped and sent to them. Bobbi Brown Holiday Wish List Deluxe Collection includes all aspiration, goods, and tools to create ultimate holiday looks. And M\u00b7A\u00b7C recently debuted its Frosted Firework collection, patterning with a diverse range of beauty influences, who generated over 60 million media impressions in the first 10 days after launching. Today, we will release our fiscal 2020 Citizenship and Sustainability Report entitled, Beauty Inspired, Value Driven. We are incredibly proud of the contribution of our employees around the world in accelerating our citizenship and sustainability efforts and have featured their successes in this year's report. The report highlights the achievement of our 2020 ESG goals as well as meaningful progress toward our 2025 goals. These milestones were reached across citizenship and sustainability priority focus areas despite the challenges of the pandemic. I'm pleased to announce the company has achieved net zero carbon emissions, and 100% renewable electricity globally for our own operations. Building upon this achievement, we also met our goals to set science-based emissions reduction targets addressing scope one and two for our data innovation in scope three for our value chain. Today announcement signals a new level of ambition and dedication to climate action for the SLO of the companies, setting targets in line with the latest climate science is testament to our values and our commitment to manage our business for the long-term. We are also proud to have reached zero industrial waste to landfill for our manufacturing, distribution, and innovation sites and we are on track to provide access to training on basic sustainability and corporate social impact programs for our employees worldwide this month. In addition, over the past two years, our programs that grants focus on health, education, and environment have positively impacted the lives of more than 20 million individuals worldwide. Our collective vision is to be the most inclusive and diverse prestige beauty company in the world, and to be the employer of choice for diverse talent at the brand of choice for diverse consumers. Our commitment to racial equality, especially our focus on driving racial equity across our business is central to achieving our vision. In today's report, we'll be publicly disclosing enhanced employee diversity metrics, and information on pay equity. We believe this transparency to all our stakeholders is important to holding ourselves accountable to our vision, while importantly, setting the stage to share our progress. In closing, there is no doubt that we are living and working in a moment unlike any other and yet, we are confident thanks to our passionate employees, cherished company values, and prudent strategy build multiple engines of growth. We are well-equipped to face the challenges of today and even better positioned to embrace the opportunities of tomorrow and continue growing global prestige beauty share. I will now turn the call over to Tracy.\nTracey Travis: Thank you, Fabrizio and hello everyone. As a reminder, my commentary today is adjusted for the items that Rainey mentioned at the beginning of the call and net sales growth numbers are in constant currency. So, starting with the first quarter results, net sales decline 9% driven by the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our brick-and-mortar distribution throughout the world. We achieved strong growth in our global online channel, Mainland China, and the skincare category and delivered better than expected results in the travel retail channel and in North America. Other areas progressively improved compared to last quarter as retail doors reopened. The December 2019 acquisition of Dr. Jart contributed approximately three points of net sales growth. From a geographic standpoint, our Asia-Pacific region rose 7%, driven primarily by strong double-digit growth in skincare and the addition of Dr. Jart sales in Mainland China rose double-digits as sales in brick-and-mortar retail continued to improve. The pace of online sales growth in China was slower this quarter, following the highly successful 6.18 Mid-Year Shopping Festival programs last quarter. Most brands and channels rose double-digits and China. Korea rose high single-digits, excluding Dr. Jart and several smaller markets returned to growth as well. Sales in Japan declined due to a tough comparison to the prior year, in which sales grew nearly 20% as consumers bought ahead of an October 2019 VAT increase. The market has also suffered from softer in store traffic due to a second wave of COVID-19. Sales in Hong Kong continued to be depressed as well due to the pandemic. Net sales in our Europe, the Middle East, and Africa region declined 9% with virtually every market continuing to feel the effects of the pandemic. While online growth continued to be quite strong, brick-and-mortar traffic remained soft, heavily impacted by COVID-19, which also resulted in significantly lower tourism in key markets. Skincare sales in the region grew double-digits driven by travel retail, but were more than offset by declines in makeup and fragrance. The major Western markets of France, Spain, and the U.K. contributed the most to the decline in sales, as did the Middle East. Our global travel retail business was essentially flat as outstanding results in Greater China, particularly Hainan Island and Hong Kong, and sequential improvement in Korea offset the effects of the significant reduction in international travel. Additionally, the growth of pre-tail and the increase in duty free purchase limits in Hainan drove higher conversion rates. Net sales in the Americas declined 24% as virtually all markets in the region continue to be impacted by COVID-19. Online sales growth continued to be a bright spot rising over 40%, however, brick-and-mortar retail remain difficult, especially in department stores and in freestanding stores. From a category standpoint, skincare was the most resilient. Net sales grew 10%, driven by continued strong performance from the Est\u00e9e Lauder and La Mer brands in Asia, including travel retail, as well as incremental sales from the acquisition of Dr. Jart. Net sales and makeup fells 32%, a significant sequential improvement from last quarter. Make up the seen the biggest impact from COVID-19, as many consumers continue to partially or fully work from home and forego social gatherings. Fragrance net sales declined 13%, a substantial improvement from last quarter. The category grew strongly in Asia, reflecting double-digit increases from both Tom Ford and Jo Malone London, as well as the recent launches of Kilian Paris and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle in Mainland China. Bath, body, and home fragrances continue to perform very well. Our haircare net sales were essentially flat, declining only 1%, while stores and salons were not operating at full capacity during the quarter, the category benefited from exceptional innovation from Aveda, including the recent launch of Botanical Repair, as well as strong online sales. Our gross margin increased 20 basis points compared to the first quarter last year. Favorable category mix and lower costs for in-store testers were partially offset by negative currency impact. Operating expenses decreased 7% and the deleveraging effect of the sales decline caused operating expenses as a percent of sales to increase 80 basis points. Agile cost management and lower selling costs resulting from both channel mix and the impact of the COVID-19-related temporary furloughs and salary reductions on employee costs resulted in a 20% operating margin, which was just 60 basis points lower than the year ago quarter despite the lower sales. Diluted EPS of $1.44 decreased 14% compared to the prior year. EPS was higher than expected due to both improved sales performance as well as more proven cost management as doors reopened throughout the quarter. During the quarter, we generated $358 million in net cash flows from operating activities, which was above the prior year, due primarily to timing of working capital items. We invested $116 million in capital expenditures, repaid the remaining $750 million outstanding on our bank revolver, and paid $174 million in dividends. We also announced this morning a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.53 per share. Our plans under the post-COVID business acceleration plan are on track with approvals expected to accelerate in the second quarter and benefits beginning to flow later in our fiscal year. So, now let's turn to our outlook. We are pleased with the sequential improvement we saw in nearly every market as the world continues to manage the effects of the pandemic. The path to recovery is not expected to be smooth as cases of COVID-19 have begun to surge again in many markets, creating renewed restrictions on travel and social activities. We are mindful of the risk of a global recession or a slow economic recovery as government support measures in certain markets taper off. We also recognize macro risks, such as ongoing trade tensions, and political uncertainty. Nonetheless, prestige beauty remains a highly desirable product category as evidenced by the sequential improvement in sales trends we experienced this quarter. And we believe our multiple engines of growth strategy positions as well to return to strong global results when the impacts from the pandemic subside. With only one quarter of the year completed and the degree of uncertainty I just described, we are not providing explicit sales and EPS guidance for the full year. However, we will provide some underlying assumptions for the year. We continue to expect sequential quarterly sales improvement as the global recovery unfolds, assuming no significant second wave resulting in broad scale retail door closures again or other major disruptive events. And we do expect to return to sales growth as of the end -- as of the third quarter. Comparisons to our record performance in the past prior year first half will be difficult. Conversely, we expect sales and profit to grow significantly in the second half of the year against a period of considerable COVID-19 impacts, with particularly strong growth in the fourth quarter. The inclusion of six months of incremental sales from the acquisition of Dr. Jart should add about one to two percentage points to sales growth for the fiscal year, but remain slightly dilutive to profit for the year. We expect to close a number of our less productive freestanding retail stores and exit certain wholesale doors primarily in Western markets. While several of our retail customers are also reducing their store footprint, many of the unproductive doors are expected to close later in the fiscal year. Our gross margin is recovered from last quarters inefficiencies related to the sudden COVID-19 impact. Additionally, we continue to invest in increased capacity to support our strong skincare growth. We will continue to leverage a portion of the savings generated from our cost programs to support advertising and expanding services and capabilities to enable strong growth in our online channel. As I mentioned before, we increased our quarterly dividend rate by 10% to $0.53 per share. We also expect to reinstate share repurchases as we gain comfort that the recovery is more sustained. So, while the environment remains quite uncertain, we are providing guidance for the second quarter. For the quarter, we expect sales to decline between 4% and 6% in constant currency. As a reminder, we are comparing against the record prior year quarter where we delivered 16% sales growth and 21% EPS growth last year. We have a robust lineup of holiday offerings at a variety of attractive price points that are carefully targeted to relevant consumer trends we are seeing during this pandemic and we expect continued strong online sales on our retailers and on our own brand sites. The incremental sales from Dr. Jart are expected to add about two points to growth and currency is expected to be accredited by approximately one point. We expect second quarter ups of $1.45 to $1.60, reflecting the sales outlook, continued cost containment measure, and investment in key growth areas like online innovation and China. Currency is expected to add $0.02 to EPS and Dr. Jart is forecast to dilute EPS by $0.03. We will continue to leverage our multiple engines of growth to invest behind a strong recovery in the context of the macro environment. We are taking strategic actions to support long-term sustainable growth by investing appropriately for the long-term, while supporting the recovery in the near-term. With a more solid start to the fiscal year and mindful of continued macro volatility over the next several months, we look forward to leveraging the tremendous strength of our brands and driving a strong recovery as the market accommodates. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions now.\nOperator: The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is going to come from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Great, thank you. Good morning, everyone. My question was about channel make shift both longer term and in the quarter itself and for fiscal 2021. So, first piece of it is just over the longer term with the things you've already talked about the acceleration of ecommerce growth. Curious if you think it's fair to say that half of your margin expansion over the next several years could come from that that channel mix dynamic. The second was that as we look into fiscal 2021, how we should be thinking about the benefits of channel mix on one hand, but then the drags that you will experience as less productive doors get closed to the degree that there's stranded costs that come with that or what the impact of door closures -- your own doors and also wholesale doors or customers choosing due to closed doors, what impact that has on the P&L in the short-term? Thanks\nFabrizio Freda: Yes. I will start and then Tracey, will join me in the answer. But basically, all our accelerating engine of growth by channels are more profitable, and that's the good news. On the other side, we have to deliver our brick and mortar productivity back to normal. And these obviously, would be influenced by how fast COVID retire and how fast they consumer get the confidence, again, to go in brick and mortar and as you -- as you said, by managing some closures. And then we need to turn the total company into growth. That, as Trace said, we believe this will be possible as of course, the trail. And so the combination of the improved accelerating engines of growth, which are more profitable, and the re-establishment of routines your brick and mortar will determine, when we can go back to our long term algorithms of growing about half a margin point per year. Tracey?\nTracey Travis: Yes. And Lauren, as you indicated, I mean timing is will really impact that. So in terms of, when we expect door closures to occur. We've already had a number of wholesale door closers and freestanding door closures over the last few years, when you think about the number of retailers that have gone out of business, unfortunately, in the last couple of years. And certain retailers have also indicated their intent to close doors over the next couple of quarters. With our post-COVID acceleration program, we too will be closing doors over the next couple of quarters more towards the end of the year, as well as some freestanding stores. So there will be a timing issue where we do see pressure from under productive brick and mortar doors, while we see the uplift that Fabrizio spoke about from our online acceleration. And that's all embedded within the guidance that we've given certainly for the second quarter and, and we'll see how the second half of the year plays out. But that's certainly a dynamic that we will be managing in fiscal 2021 as the foreclosures are staged throughout the balance of the year and into fiscal 2022.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Dara Mohsenian, Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey, good morning, guys.\nFabrizio Freda: Good morning.\nDara Mohsenian: So for Fabrizio, I was hoping maybe you could give us some perspective on how much of the increased ecommerce demand you've seen since the beginning of the pandemic is sustainable in your mind as you look at longer term? And perhaps within that, can you detail with the e-commerce sales increase you've seen during the pandemic? How much of that you think is driven by new customers? What level of repeat rates you're seeing among those new customers?\nFabrizio Freda: Yes. So first of all, the increase of online is stored in, during this quarter in total, we were growing about 40%. But our brand.com and other -- and other -- some retailer.com are growing much stronger. Our brand.com is 60%. So the growth is consistent in IBD personally is here to stay. Sorry. And the reason, why it's here to stay because the -- a lot of this growth is about a new consumers that we see -- we see online. And many of these new consumer are mature consumers and before online was mainly the destination of younger people, millennials et cetera. Now is the convenient is for everyone. Everyone is online and also the people that before were not accustomed to go there are going there more often. So what we see is that people buy online, maybe in the future when the store will be open, we believe that omni-channel will be very strong and so people will use both brick and mortar and online obviously. But the amount of purchases online will stay higher and particularly will stay higher in our -- in our estimate in the mature group of consumers, which are very important for us, very important for beauty. So this is a sustainable trend and is sustainable acceleration. The second thing which is happen, which is very important is that historically however high tax services of, advice or of the service of customization of the -- or trying the products was exclusively done in stores, and then online at the beginning was mainly a convenience buying opportunity or what you already knew. Shopping was in brick and mortar and buying was online. This is changed forever. Now there\u2019s shopping a brick and mortar and there\u2019s shopping online. And what I mean with that is that the high catch services of customization of advice or recommendation are now super present online. And the consumers really are catered to the service like never before. So we spoke in our prepared remarks about the availability of chats, with consultants ability to visual trying on, the availability of live streaming opportunities, all these is increasing and the engagement of consumer online is increasing. We mentioned that, we have 30 minutes to presence on visual trying on versus only few minutes in the past. So the combination of new consumer's, particularly more mature consumer, better services online with a lot more time and more engagement. And the development of this opportunity for everyone, I think is going to be a sustainable and growing segment for many years to come. But obviously, we absolutely believe that omni-channel will be also important on the future, and the brick and mortar, we go back to the right level of productivity to the right level of traffic. And there will be a combination of the two. There will be an even better combination than in the past.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.\nDana Telsey: Good morning, everyone, and nice to see the progress, as you think about the makeup category. How are you planning for innovation going forward? What is the timeline look like? And also, Fabrizio, when you talk about channels, what are your thoughts on the specialty multi-channel going forward? Thank you.\nFabrizio Freda: So our point of view and make up, we go back to be a very attractive, a very fast growing category, once called we retreat and is you know, the makeup is very much linked to use educations for makeup and the use of education for makeup include business, obviously meetings or, going to the office, includes social gathering of any kind, and include also positive mood of recovery and in the interest of expressing ourselves. And so the oldies will come back, will come back strongly, and make-up will come back with it. As we said in the prepared remarks, there are certain categories of make up which are already coming back. Already growing is visible the makeup is much stronger were called the bait like in Asia, and is -- so is obviously going to come back, and we will be ready for that. We are preparing starting from the categories that in our opinion, we come back first and -- and we are investing not only in ready to sustain the recovery, but also investing in innovation in the category that will be the first one to come back. If you take, today reality for example eye makeup is much stronger than other categories, just because in a period of masking, eye makeup is more relevant, then out of the lips, for example. And so -- there is a very positive trend in our opinion, just a matter of time. And that time will depend on the COVID. In terms of your second part of the question, specialty multi around the world will remain a very strong channel, very strong channel for us, a strong channel of growth and in specialty multi the strength, in our opinion, would also be the fact that the retail.com, this channel should continue to increase fashion to get out, to be very, very strong is the specialty multi the key opportunity is to continue to be strong in -- in-store, obviously, but particularly to become equally strong in the retail to come and to bring the services and the experiences that have been so strong in brick and mortar to the retail.com in the long term everywhere in the world.\nDana Telsey: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: Yes, hey, good morning. Thanks. Can we just talk a little bit more about the exit rates and consumption coming out of the first quarter? And what you're seeing in terms of momentum with a little bit more granularity whether by geography or category channel, however, you think is most instructive? And if you're able to share a little bit of data around October results, that would be great, because we clearly saw volatility in shipments timing over the course of the September quarter. So I'm just curious as to how you're thinking about that month-to-month lumpiness as we look through and out towards the end of the calendar year as well? Thank you.\nFabrizio Freda: Yes, I'll start, and please Tracey add, any perspective. If I understand correctly, your question, so the strength by category is in consumption is clearly in skin care and this remains very strong and in certain regions rather accelerating. And within skin care, there are certain sub-categories like moisturizers, serum, masks, which are really flying or eye products or products for the contour of the eye, et cetera. So, there are -- so skin care and certain skin care category is clearly the fastest growing consumption. Makeup, I just answer one question is makeups dependent by category eye makeup is strong consumption, for example lip makeup is under pressure in this moment. But even with this within category these allow us to focus more on the growth consumption in this category. Fragrance, surprisingly, back faster than what we originally thought and this is great news for the holidays. In fact, we are ready to try to push fragrances clearly in the best possible way during the holidays that we believe is a big opportunity, particularly our high-end fragrances in our artisanal fragrances like Jo Malone, Tom Ford, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle, KILIAN and Le Labo. Le Labo is extraordinarily well everywhere in the world. And so then hair care. Now, as I think Tracey explained in her prepared remarks that Aveda is doing exceptionally well. For us, Aveda is heading great innovation, a great program, great work online in support of also the salons that work with Aveda. And in this brand is also hitting all the areas, because is obviously is about natural, is about taking care of the world and so is also very much into the consumer space of sustainability. And this is starting to paying dividends. So hair care also is strong on consumption. And so net by category is skin care, strong hair care, strong fragrance recovery, and makeup is the more gradual recovery that we assume for the long-term. In terms of the dynamic of the regions, obviously, you have a consumption recovered in Asia, which is much faster than anyone else. And on the contrary, in the U.S. and in Europe, the impact of recovery has been much bigger. But we see progress everywhere. That's the important thing. The important thing is that the level of progress is recovery is consistent. Every part of the world, despite the Asia is ahead in the trend of recovery. And then in terms of consumer groups, consumption, I found particularly interesting that the consumption is being extraordinary in a more mature consumers. And that's what we see, that is a long-term benefit. I mean, the younger consumer is being the driver of [Indiscernible] and in this moment that's less the case. But the mature consumer being a bit more following the young consumer in the last probably five years, I think this is changing, the mature consumer are getting a much more active even in experimenting and trying new innovation. And again, this is for us is a very positive sign for the long-term. So consumption overall is gradually recovering, and is gradual recovery across every segment, but with very different return and speed by segments.\nTracey Travis: And then in terms of the month or the second quarter, October came in, is coming in as we expected. So and it is reflected in our guidance. So I know we had starting in July, a little bit of a shipment to restart the business, given the fact that some of our inventory levels were low, particularly in North America we don't see anything like that in the second quarter. And as you probably know, Steve, October is the smaller of the three months in the second quarter, obviously, November and December with for us both Singles' Day in China and in Asia as well as holiday. November and December are by far the two bigger months.\nSteve Powers: Yes. Thanks so much.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Erinn Murphy, Piper Sandler.\nErinn Murphy: My question is around travel retail, it improve very nicely in the quarter. Could you just share a little bit about how much was driven from the higher duty free allowances in Hainan Island? And then how are you thinking about travel retail for the balance of the year? Thank you.\nFabrizio Freda: Yes. Travel retail as an exceptional performance and clearly the West, meaning Europe and the Americas are very, very basically closed or very, very small to travel. So the first thing is that the recovery has been being driven by Asia and within Asia, there are three elements which are driving this recovery. The first, as we discussed, is the acceleration of domestic travel within China with Hainan at the center of that. And Hainan has been seen both an increase of traffic meaning domestic tourism that came back at a very high percent, but I think that the number published, they are really about 80% of what they historically were in terms of domestic travel. And then in term of traffic and then the increase of possibility of buying per consumer that together it generated that the very big growth that we have seen, and we believe this is so sustainable. Then there is the opening on certain corridor in Asia, which has started particularly on Kong, Macau, and that we see in Korea is also starting being more solid. So -- and then is the retail, meaning online, the ability to reserve online, the product, which is accelerating dramatically, obviously in a moment where the consumer are still concerned to go in stores with a lot of people, the ability to do retail is serving their purpose and make them feel safer and protected. So the combination of those three things is -- has very important results, which is increasing conversion. As I said several times, in travel retail, the results are driven by traffic and conversion. And in this moment, even in presence of lower traffic, we are seeing a dramatic increase in conversion. And what do we see for the long-term? Under the long-term will be dependent, obviously, how traffic will be restated. The domestic travel in China is a new element. And obviously, this -- we believe will remain an opportunity for the long-term, the -- when international traffic will be reestablished will depend on COVID, obviously, and that we will monitor closely and serve this purpose, but the increase of retail as a percentage, particularly in Asia will remain a very positive element for the long-term, because will have an extraordinarily positive element -- impact, sorry on conversion even when international traffic will restart, that because of this is the combination of what's happened during COVID. And the opportunity of traffic recovery in the long-term will make this channel in our opinion, will remain one of the most interesting channels for the long-term.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Jason English, Goldman Sachs.\nJason English: Hey, good morning, folks.\nFabrizio Freda: Good morning, Jason.\nJason English : Congratulations on --thank you. Congratulations on sequential improvement, especially in travel retail. It's quite impressive. I want to come back to some of the questions on margins. As we were closing fiscal 2019, I think you finished with 17.5% EBIT margin; your 50 bps algorithm would have landed us to around 19.5% by fiscal 2023. And I referenced fiscal 2023. because it may be like the first year we're back to sort of normal, because we're going to have a lot of turbulence obviously for the remainder of this year, and then residual spillover just on door closures, et cetera in 2022. But if we're tracking towards the 19.5% in 2023 before, is there any reason that we can't get to it if not actually exceeded, right? You\u2019re pulling a lot of cost out, right now I imagine you'll discover that not all of need to go back. And you've got this pretty compelling from a margin mix perspective, tailwind. Why -- are there any offsets that would prevent you from getting to that 19.5% if not actually exceeding it, assuming 23% isn't de-normalized?\nTracey Travis : Yes, I mean, I think in -- on the last call, Jason, we indicated that we expected to get potentially to our fiscal 2019 margins by fiscal 2022. Now part of the post-COVID acceleration program, certainly is helping to accelerate the achievement of that. But I think that math is a little aggressive right now for fiscal 2023. As we think about the recovery of the business, and obviously, it all depends on how quickly we get back to your point normal as it relates to normal consumption from a brick-and-mortar standpoint, and where the balance of the channel mix plays out. So that's a little bit aggressive, but recognize that certainly given the cost actions we take as it relates to post-COVID acceleration to accelerate our brick-and-mortar productivity and therefore help our margin. And some of the favorable mix items that Lauren indicated earlier from the growth of online as well as when travel retail resumes, which is another factor for us. We had good travel retail performance quarter. Travel retail is another accretive channel for us in international travel whenever that resumes and what that looks like will also be a factor. So we're very comfortable that we will have margin progression. And we will get to the 19.5 that you're referencing. It's just a matter of timing.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the lineup Rob Ottenstein, Evercore.\nRob Ottenstein: Great. Thank you very much. I'd love to circle back to mainland China. And perhaps can you tell us a little bit about the overall sales growth online and offline, kind of what sort of impact travel retail had on the business. And given your comments about increases in domestic travel, retail in China and Hainan, should we kind of think that Mainland China X travel retail may not see the kind of growth that it's had before? And then, finally related to China, any kind of impact for timing on 11.11 did that have any impact? Thank you.\nFabrizio Freda: So, no, I think we look at the Chinese consumers in total, and it was another extraordinary quarter for Chinese consumer consumption. We estimate that the total Chinese consumer consumption was about plus 20% and we were plus 28% to plus 30% range, when you look at the total, so extraordinary? Actually, I think we have developed the strength that when the Chinese consumer shopping mainly online, we are online and there are high traffic moment when this happen. When they come back to the store, we're there in brick-and-mortar. And this was a gain a double-digit growth in brick-and-mortar for the first time after COVID. When they go domestically travel go to Hainan, we are among the first being there being ready for that. So look at us as being dynamically following the Chinese consumer wherever they choose to shop and wherever the traffic is side by quarter and see that flexibility as a strength rather than having every single China having to perform in the same every quarter. This is not going to happen. China is a very dynamic market. And in fact, the online, the 11.11 and then the 18.6 meaning the June events, which are two huge to do create the fact that in July, August is -- online is less strong. But then domestic travel was much stronger. And the real strength is to be able to be there at the right moment in every one of these channels. So Chinese consumers are strong. Our growth in China is strong. We are a local organization in China, really focus on the long-term with enormously built in flexibility and collaboration between different groups. This quarter that was particularly interesting because we have the more cities as explained. Brick-and-mortar went back to double-digit growth. Domestic travel went to about 80% of traffic. New consumers were coming in our brands, particularly from lower tier cities, via online and via the travel. And we launched 2 new brands, as you heard of Fragrances. On top of that, we are expanding our scientific presence and investing in a new research center, R&D in Shanghai that will give us new capabilities to even more locally relevant. So it is a very strong momentum for China. And we personally, I personally believe that the consumption of Chinese consumers will be growing strongly for the long-term.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Fulvio Cazzol with Berenberg.\nFulvio Cazzol: Yes. Good morning, and thank you for taking my question. I was wanting to ask about the innovation pipeline. There was some mentions made in the prepared remarks. And I remember in previous quarters, you highlighted that you were being opportunistic in terms of product launches, trying to time them when they could be the most effective. So I was just wondering if you could give us a bit of color on how your first quarter played out, if that benefit from some of the shifts of innovations from previous quarter or was it fairly normalized. And then following up on that, how should we think about Q2, and maybe even 2021? Is there a lot of pent-up, let's say, innovations to come out and help your growth along, please? Thank you.\nFabrizio Freda: Yes, first of all, our innovation has been very strong as 30% of sales in the previous quarter has been 20%, 25%. So frankly, we don't aim to a specific percentage as innovation is very strong and we have a great pipeline. So your question is how do we decide how to focus on which innovation? This obviously was the moment where skin care was the most demanded from consumers. And we tend to focus our innovation where there is the strongest trend and the stronger consumer demand. And so definitely skin care was a big focus. Now, obviously, on skin care, you cannot plan innovation in a few months is a very important investment for the long-term. So we had this extraordinary innovation advance the retailer and concentrate on La Mer that we have planned for that period. It's just that we went even deeper, even stronger because we saw the opportunity. So the innovation timing is set that we have flexibility obviously, to move them when needed. But the most important thing which is flexible, is the amount of investment, the amount of focus that we can have on different innovation, depending on the consumer demand in that specific moment and in a very different location. So I our agility is about we tailor innovation locally and so the local teams have the opportunity to launch it light, launch a big, go deeper, postpone demand, anticipate demand, there is a lot of flexibility to tailor the innovation to the local consumers. But the fundamental innovation is done with a very accurate pipeline for the long-term. And that's why we say that our pipeline is never been stronger, frankly, and this was already in place before COVID.\nTracey Travis: And the only thing I would add to that we had also very strong innovation. We spoke about the fact that the fragrance category has been a nice surprise for us and that has been driven by innovation, across the board with our fragrance brands and then obviously haircare with Aveda. Aveda has had a couple of very strong innovation launches this year that really has driven a lot of momentum for us in haircare and certainly helped from a recovery standpoint, where we did see some shifts in innovation and from a timing standpoint is in the makeup category understandably. So we do have strong programs lined up for the second half of the year, in addition to skincare and fragrance and hair care, also for our makeup category, hopefully, as people start to gradually wear more makeup and perhaps become more socially active that innovation will actually pan out to help to continue to grow that makeup category.\nFulvio Cazzol: Fantastic. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes the question-and-answer portion of today's call.

            "name": "Fabrizio Freda",
            "content": "Thank you, Rainey and hello everyone. I hope that each of you are in good health, as the world continues to confront COVID-19. Our hearts are with those impacted and our focus remains first and foremost, with the safety and well-being of our employees, their families, and our consumers. I continue to be incredibly inspired by our employees' enduring compassion, creativity, and resiliency, you are making us a better company, and I stand my deepest gratitude. Our diversified prestige beauty portfolio of categories, channels, geographies, brands, consumers segments, and price points give us many levers to fuel the business, both in times of prosperity as well as during more challenging times. In this most difficult moment, our multiple engines of growth strategy is invaluable. For the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, sales declined only 9%, a significant sequential improvement, driven by every category. Fragrance and healthcare in particular, had striking progress. Our hero products and innovations thrived and contributed meaningfully to sales. We successfully adjusted our cost structure to minimize the leveraging effects of lower sales, resulting in an operating margin of 20%, very close to the first quarter of last year, when we had double-digit sales growth. In different periods over the last decade, we were driven by different engines, leading to prestige beauty share gains each year and we expect this year to be no different. Since the pandemic began, we estimate that we have grown prestige beauty share globally. On our last earning call, we explained that the growth engines at the moment are the skincare category, the online channel in, Asia-Pacific regions, each delivered terrific performance to begin our new fiscal year. The Este\u0301e Lauder brand performed exceptionally well, returning to growth in the quarter powered by its hero franchises in skincare. Its Advanced Night Repair franchise delivered very strong double-digit sales growth. Encouragingly, the brand success in skincare was broad based as each of the Re-Nutriv, Revitalizing Supreme, Perfectionist, Micro Essence, nutritious franchises also grew double-digits. This is a remarkable achievement when compared to the brand's very strong skincare performance in the prior year. La Mer had a superb quarter with double-digit sales growth globally, driven by its continued outperformance of luxury skincare growth in Mainland China. The August launch of its new The Concentrate delivered especially strong double-digit sales growth in Asia -- in Asia-Pacific and consumer saw the shooting power of this barrier serum with its new protective antioxidant benefits. Even amidst the pandemic La Mer is welcoming many new consumers, farther demonstrating the irritable appeals of the brand's superior quality. At our last Investor Day, we discussed growth strategies for each of our large, scaling, and developing brands. And even in these challenging times, we are resolute in our focus on all three tiers. The Darphin brand is a beautiful example in the developing tier of a brand succeeding through these perilous times. Darphin contributed to the skincare category growth in the quarter as the successful launch of Intral Rescue Super Concentrate serum amplify the strengths of the brand's hero products. Our acquisition of Dr. Jart with its terrific entry prestige derma brand positioning and desirable hero products enhanced the organic sales growth of skincare. Momentum in the serum watery lotion in eye care subcategories carried into the quarter deriving skincare growth. The August launch of Este\u0301e Lauder new Advanced Night Repair serum performed extraordinary across geographies and channel aided by compelling activation and an over 40% surge in consumers' reviews since launch when comparing to the entire lifespan of the previous version. Impressively, Clinique even better Clinique interactive serum continues to perform strongly in its third quarter since launch. We deliver outstanding double-digit sales growth online, with skincare, makeup, fragrance, and hair care over prospering. Once again, each of our online channels contributed meaningfully. We continued to strategically invest in our brand sites globally, bringing our classic high-touch services to consumers online. The response has been phenomenal. We are seeing tremendous growth in time spent on for chat, virtual try-on, and shoppable live streams. Even with most retail doors reopen around the world, sales rose 60% organically on our brand sites. We now have virtual try-on across more brands and categories in more markets. In the first quarter alone, we hosted over 1 million virtual try-on sessions globally, with consumer spending more than 30 minutes on average in a session. In North America, the Este\u0301e Lauder brand launched AI-driven product recommendations based on real-time consumers' behaviors and past preferences. These dynamic merchandising holds great promise across our brands and regions. Clinique global sales growth on Brand.com in the quarter was exceptional among the strongest across the portfolio. Clinique Skin School, on-demand live streaming was a great success, leading to new daily programming that combines top consultants with influences to future holiday sets and favorite Clinique products. Clinique is our first brand to launch new technology that pairs multiple host in one shop about live stream. Bobbi Brown continue to scale its artistry like never before program, expanding visual artistry to include live chat, pre-booked video consultations, master classes, and live streaming by rapidly converting some of its global makeup assets into a network of virtual sellers. Most of the brands markets now offer these consultations on Brand.com, on local social platforms such as WhatsApp, WeChat, and Instagram. These virtual services have a higher conversion rate, up to 10 times the average and a higher average order value. With enticing innovation and engaging new services and tools, commercial grew -- conversion grew strong double-digits across our brand sites, most compelling is the significant conversion growth in markets that are under penetrated online, such as Continental Europe. In the quarter, conversion there grew over 75%, while in Latin America; conversion growth far exceeded 100%. These positions are well for suitable profitable growth online. We invested in online fulfillment during the quarter, strengthening our capacity globally and we are addressing seasonal fulfillment locations in our largest markets in anticipation of robust consumer demand for holiday. Leveraging our investment in technology, we deployed more omnichannel capabilities in several markets. In the U.S., we have seen dramatic uptick in buy online pick up in store format. The brands also partnered with Postmates domestically to launch same-day delivery and open a new experiential store in New York. The store features extensive personalization options for consumers and interactive digital experiences. In these initiatives and more, we are meeting the desires of consumers who are craving convenience and choice, offering them new ways to shop in today's environment. The third engines of growth, Asia-Pacific, also exceled. Several markets contributed to the region high single-digit sales growth, which is most notable as some markets in the region dealt with new waves of COVID-19. Mainland China, Korea, and several smaller markets grew organically. In Mainland China, we continue to invest in the vibrant opportunity of our second home market. We expanded into more cities in the course; reaching over 130. We increased our advertising investment across social and digital platform, showcasing exciting innovation and building brand awareness as we reach new consumers. We continued expanding our talent in anticipation of our new state-of-art innovation center, which will open in Shanghai, as we aim to best meet the needs of Chinese and Asian consumers with local relevancy and local trends, through increased capabilities in product design, formulation, consumer insights, and trend analytics. In Mainland China, the bricks-and-mortar channel returned to double-digit growth, such that both offline and online were powerful growth drivers. The travel retail channels further contributed, driven by tremendous growth in [Indiscernible], partly reflecting increased duty-free purchase limits, the opening of some travel corridors in Asia and online retail growth facilitating higher conversion, magnifying Chinese consumer strengths. Indeed demand from the Chinese consumers was very strong across these channels, most especially in skincare, and we estimate we grew our prestige beauty share. The Fragrance category sales growth accelerated in Asia-Pacific in the quarter. We introduced Kilian Paris and Fre\u0301de\u0301ric Malle in Mainland China, in very select distribution. These unique luxurious brands are proving highly desirable, which coupled with the ongoing strengths of Jo Malone London and Tom Ford drove significant double-digit sales growth of Fragrances. In Korea, Fragrances also soared, Le Labo, new [Indiscernible] fragrances drove meaningful upside, demonstrating the strength of our locally relevant innovation. Around the world, we continue to closely monitor the evolution of consumer attitudes and purchase behavior related to COVID-19. We combine sophisticated social media listening capabilities with machine learning and properly consumer research techniques to develop insights and adapt our marketing and product offering with speed and agility to capture changing trends. Looking ahead, we are confident in the return of growth in the challenged makeup category as the recovery will unfolds. In the meantime, we continue to focus on subcategories in makeup, the favored in the era of masks for COVID-19. In fact, even in lip, which is overall pressured, the liquid lip subcategory is growing naturally driven by M\u00b7A\u00b7C of Power Kiss [ph] liquid lip as consumers sick matte finish formulas that last. Our innovation represented over 30% of sales in the first quarter. We have an exciting pipeline on new product launches for the remainder of fiscal year 2021 for both engines of moment and what we expect to be engines of the future. In October, Clinique launched Moisture Surge Intense Replenishing Hydrator, a new formula that hydrates skin for a full 72 hours in a cream gel formula that dries for drier skin types. This month La Mer will introduce its new [Indiscernible] concentrated night balm, an anti-stress balm, slow crafted with crystal miracle broth that promotes skin natural rebuilding of collagen to help transform the look of skin during sleep. Continuing our progress on sustainability, Origins intend to be the first prestige beauty brand to bring an advanced recycle tube package to market with this Clear Improvement Active Charcoal Mask in 2021. These expands upon Clinique recent launch of all about clean in packaging with most consumer recycled material and plan the right plastic for each tube and most consumer recycled material for its cap. For fiscal year 2021, we continue to expect sequential improvement in sales growth each quarter and to deal global share while prestige beauty progressively returned to growth. We are mindful of the ongoing inputs of COVID-19, most especially the very limited traffic in retail doors, a story open and the second waves occurring in certain markets. We are investing in several strategic priorities intended to drive our long-term sustainable growth that progressive in the word of past call the business acceleration program. For the second quarter, we have magnificent plans for holiday and the 11.11 Global Shopping Festival. Holiday merchandising began a few weeks ago and our brands created rich activations with engaging [Indiscernible] products. Este\u0301e Lauder LML have kits that include best-selling hero process to drive recruitment. Origin is making holiday gifting easy, offering consumers the ability to text or email a gift, allowing the recipients to either accept or exchange their product before it is gift wrapped and sent to them. Bobbi Brown Holiday Wish List Deluxe Collection includes all aspiration, goods, and tools to create ultimate holiday looks. And M\u00b7A\u00b7C recently debuted its Frosted Firework collection, patterning with a diverse range of beauty influences, who generated over 60 million media impressions in the first 10 days after launching. Today, we will release our fiscal 2020 Citizenship and Sustainability Report entitled, Beauty Inspired, Value Driven. We are incredibly proud of the contribution of our employees around the world in accelerating our citizenship and sustainability efforts and have featured their successes in this year's report. The report highlights the achievement of our 2020 ESG goals as well as meaningful progress toward our 2025 goals. These milestones were reached across citizenship and sustainability priority focus areas despite the challenges of the pandemic. I'm pleased to announce the company has achieved net zero carbon emissions, and 100% renewable electricity globally for our own operations. Building upon this achievement, we also met our goals to set science-based emissions reduction targets addressing scope one and two for our data innovation in scope three for our value chain. Today announcement signals a new level of ambition and dedication to climate action for the SLO of the companies, setting targets in line with the latest climate science is testament to our values and our commitment to manage our business for the long-term. We are also proud to have reached zero industrial waste to landfill for our manufacturing, distribution, and innovation sites and we are on track to provide access to training on basic sustainability and corporate social impact programs for our employees worldwide this month. In addition, over the past two years, our programs that grants focus on health, education, and environment have positively impacted the lives of more than 20 million individuals worldwide. Our collective vision is to be the most inclusive and diverse prestige beauty company in the world, and to be the employer of choice for diverse talent at the brand of choice for diverse consumers. Our commitment to racial equality, especially our focus on driving racial equity across our business is central to achieving our vision. In today's report, we'll be publicly disclosing enhanced employee diversity metrics, and information on pay equity. We believe this transparency to all our stakeholders is important to holding ourselves accountable to our vision, while importantly, setting the stage to share our progress. In closing, there is no doubt that we are living and working in a moment unlike any other and yet, we are confident thanks to our passionate employees, cherished company values, and prudent strategy build multiple engines of growth. We are well-equipped to face the challenges of today and even better positioned to embrace the opportunities of tomorrow and continue growing global prestige beauty share. I will now turn the call over to Tracy. Yes. I will start and then Tracey, will join me in the answer. But basically, all our accelerating engine of growth by channels are more profitable, and that's the good news. On the other side, we have to deliver our brick and mortar productivity back to normal. And these obviously, would be influenced by how fast COVID retire and how fast they consumer get the confidence, again, to go in brick and mortar and as you -- as you said, by managing some closures. And then we need to turn the total company into growth. That, as Trace said, we believe this will be possible as of course, the trail. And so the combination of the improved accelerating engines of growth, which are more profitable, and the re-establishment of routines your brick and mortar will determine, when we can go back to our long term algorithms of growing about half a margin point per year. Tracey? Good morning. Yes. So first of all, the increase of online is stored in, during this quarter in total, we were growing about 40%. But our brand.com and other -- and other -- some retailer.com are growing much stronger. Our brand.com is 60%. So the growth is consistent in IBD personally is here to stay. Sorry. And the reason, why it's here to stay because the -- a lot of this growth is about a new consumers that we see -- we see online. And many of these new consumer are mature consumers and before online was mainly the destination of younger people, millennials et cetera. Now is the convenient is for everyone. Everyone is online and also the people that before were not accustomed to go there are going there more often. So what we see is that people buy online, maybe in the future when the store will be open, we believe that omni-channel will be very strong and so people will use both brick and mortar and online obviously. But the amount of purchases online will stay higher and particularly will stay higher in our -- in our estimate in the mature group of consumers, which are very important for us, very important for beauty. So this is a sustainable trend and is sustainable acceleration. The second thing which is happen, which is very important is that historically however high tax services of, advice or of the service of customization of the -- or trying the products was exclusively done in stores, and then online at the beginning was mainly a convenience buying opportunity or what you already knew. Shopping was in brick and mortar and buying was online. This is changed forever. Now there's shopping a brick and mortar and there's shopping online. And what I mean with that is that the high catch services of customization of advice or recommendation are now super present online. And the consumers really are catered to the service like never before. So we spoke in our prepared remarks about the availability of chats, with consultants ability to visual trying on, the availability of live streaming opportunities, all these is increasing and the engagement of consumer online is increasing. We mentioned that, we have 30 minutes to presence on visual trying on versus only few minutes in the past. So the combination of new consumer's, particularly more mature consumer, better services online with a lot more time and more engagement. And the development of this opportunity for everyone, I think is going to be a sustainable and growing segment for many years to come. But obviously, we absolutely believe that omni-channel will be also important on the future, and the brick and mortar, we go back to the right level of productivity to the right level of traffic. And there will be a combination of the two. There will be an even better combination than in the past. So our point of view and make up, we go back to be a very attractive, a very fast growing category, once called we retreat and is you know, the makeup is very much linked to use educations for makeup and the use of education for makeup include business, obviously meetings or, going to the office, includes social gathering of any kind, and include also positive mood of recovery and in the interest of expressing ourselves. And so the oldies will come back, will come back strongly, and make-up will come back with it. As we said in the prepared remarks, there are certain categories of make up which are already coming back. Already growing is visible the makeup is much stronger were called the bait like in Asia, and is -- so is obviously going to come back, and we will be ready for that. We are preparing starting from the categories that in our opinion, we come back first and -- and we are investing not only in ready to sustain the recovery, but also investing in innovation in the category that will be the first one to come back. If you take, today reality for example eye makeup is much stronger than other categories, just because in a period of masking, eye makeup is more relevant, then out of the lips, for example. And so -- there is a very positive trend in our opinion, just a matter of time. And that time will depend on the COVID. In terms of your second part of the question, specialty multi around the world will remain a very strong channel, very strong channel for us, a strong channel of growth and in specialty multi the strength, in our opinion, would also be the fact that the retail.com, this channel should continue to increase fashion to get out, to be very, very strong is the specialty multi the key opportunity is to continue to be strong in -- in-store, obviously, but particularly to become equally strong in the retail to come and to bring the services and the experiences that have been so strong in brick and mortar to the retail.com in the long term everywhere in the world. Yes, I'll start, and please Tracey add, any perspective. If I understand correctly, your question, so the strength by category is in consumption is clearly in skin care and this remains very strong and in certain regions rather accelerating. And within skin care, there are certain sub-categories like moisturizers, serum, masks, which are really flying or eye products or products for the contour of the eye, et cetera. So, there are -- so skin care and certain skin care category is clearly the fastest growing consumption. Makeup, I just answer one question is makeups dependent by category eye makeup is strong consumption, for example lip makeup is under pressure in this moment. But even with this within category these allow us to focus more on the growth consumption in this category. Fragrance, surprisingly, back faster than what we originally thought and this is great news for the holidays. In fact, we are ready to try to push fragrances clearly in the best possible way during the holidays that we believe is a big opportunity, particularly our high-end fragrances in our artisanal fragrances like Jo Malone, Tom Ford, Fre\u0301de\u0301ric Malle, KILIAN and Le Labo. Le Labo is extraordinarily well everywhere in the world. And so then hair care. Now, as I think Tracey explained in her prepared remarks that Aveda is doing exceptionally well. For us, Aveda is heading great innovation, a great program, great work online in support of also the salons that work with Aveda. And in this brand is also hitting all the areas, because is obviously is about natural, is about taking care of the world and so is also very much into the consumer space of sustainability. And this is starting to paying dividends. So hair care also is strong on consumption. And so net by category is skin care, strong hair care, strong fragrance recovery, and makeup is the more gradual recovery that we assume for the long-term. In terms of the dynamic of the regions, obviously, you have a consumption recovered in Asia, which is much faster than anyone else. And on the contrary, in the U.S. and in Europe, the impact of recovery has been much bigger. But we see progress everywhere. That's the important thing. The important thing is that the level of progress is recovery is consistent. Every part of the world, despite the Asia is ahead in the trend of recovery. And then in terms of consumer groups, consumption, I found particularly interesting that the consumption is being extraordinary in a more mature consumers. And that's what we see, that is a long-term benefit. I mean, the younger consumer is being the driver of [Indiscernible] and in this moment that's less the case. But the mature consumer being a bit more following the young consumer in the last probably five years, I think this is changing, the mature consumer are getting a much more active even in experimenting and trying new innovation. And again, this is for us is a very positive sign for the long-term. So consumption overall is gradually recovering, and is gradual recovery across every segment, but with very different return and speed by segments. Yes. Travel retail as an exceptional performance and clearly the West, meaning Europe and the Americas are very, very basically closed or very, very small to travel. So the first thing is that the recovery has been being driven by Asia and within Asia, there are three elements which are driving this recovery. The first, as we discussed, is the acceleration of domestic travel within China with Hainan at the center of that. And Hainan has been seen both an increase of traffic meaning domestic tourism that came back at a very high percent, but I think that the number published, they are really about 80% of what they historically were in terms of domestic travel. And then in term of traffic and then the increase of possibility of buying per consumer that together it generated that the very big growth that we have seen, and we believe this is so sustainable. Then there is the opening on certain corridor in Asia, which has started particularly on Kong, Macau, and that we see in Korea is also starting being more solid. So -- and then is the retail, meaning online, the ability to reserve online, the product, which is accelerating dramatically, obviously in a moment where the consumer are still concerned to go in stores with a lot of people, the ability to do retail is serving their purpose and make them feel safer and protected. So the combination of those three things is -- has very important results, which is increasing conversion. As I said several times, in travel retail, the results are driven by traffic and conversion. And in this moment, even in presence of lower traffic, we are seeing a dramatic increase in conversion. And what do we see for the long-term? Under the long-term will be dependent, obviously, how traffic will be restated. The domestic travel in China is a new element. And obviously, this -- we believe will remain an opportunity for the long-term, the -- when international traffic will be reestablished will depend on COVID, obviously, and that we will monitor closely and serve this purpose, but the increase of retail as a percentage, particularly in Asia will remain a very positive element for the long-term, because will have an extraordinarily positive element -- impact, sorry on conversion even when international traffic will restart, that because of this is the combination of what's happened during COVID. And the opportunity of traffic recovery in the long-term will make this channel in our opinion, will remain one of the most interesting channels for the long-term. Good morning, Jason. So, no, I think we look at the Chinese consumers in total, and it was another extraordinary quarter for Chinese consumer consumption. We estimate that the total Chinese consumer consumption was about plus 20% and we were plus 28% to plus 30% range, when you look at the total, so extraordinary? Actually, I think we have developed the strength that when the Chinese consumer shopping mainly online, we are online and there are high traffic moment when this happen. When they come back to the store, we're there in brick-and-mortar. And this was a gain a double-digit growth in brick-and-mortar for the first time after COVID. When they go domestically travel go to Hainan, we are among the first being there being ready for that. So look at us as being dynamically following the Chinese consumer wherever they choose to shop and wherever the traffic is side by quarter and see that flexibility as a strength rather than having every single China having to perform in the same every quarter. This is not going to happen. China is a very dynamic market. And in fact, the online, the 11.11 and then the 18.6 meaning the June events, which are two huge to do create the fact that in July, August is -- online is less strong. But then domestic travel was much stronger. And the real strength is to be able to be there at the right moment in every one of these channels. So Chinese consumers are strong. Our growth in China is strong. We are a local organization in China, really focus on the long-term with enormously built in flexibility and collaboration between different groups. This quarter that was particularly interesting because we have the more cities as explained. Brick-and-mortar went back to double-digit growth. Domestic travel went to about 80% of traffic. New consumers were coming in our brands, particularly from lower tier cities, via online and via the travel. And we launched 2 new brands, as you heard of Fragrances. On top of that, we are expanding our scientific presence and investing in a new research center, R&D in Shanghai that will give us new capabilities to even more locally relevant. So it is a very strong momentum for China. And we personally, I personally believe that the consumption of Chinese consumers will be growing strongly for the long-term. Yes, first of all, our innovation has been very strong as 30% of sales in the previous quarter has been 20%, 25%. So frankly, we don't aim to a specific percentage as innovation is very strong and we have a great pipeline. So your question is how do we decide how to focus on which innovation? This obviously was the moment where skin care was the most demanded from consumers. And we tend to focus our innovation where there is the strongest trend and the stronger consumer demand. And so definitely skin care was a big focus. Now, obviously, on skin care, you cannot plan innovation in a few months is a very important investment for the long-term. So we had this extraordinary innovation advance the retailer and concentrate on La Mer that we have planned for that period. It's just that we went even deeper, even stronger because we saw the opportunity. So the innovation timing is set that we have flexibility obviously, to move them when needed. But the most important thing which is flexible, is the amount of investment, the amount of focus that we can have on different innovation, depending on the consumer demand in that specific moment and in a very different location. So I our agility is about we tailor innovation locally and so the local teams have the opportunity to launch it light, launch a big, go deeper, postpone demand, anticipate demand, there is a lot of flexibility to tailor the innovation to the local consumers. But the fundamental innovation is done with a very accurate pipeline for the long-term. And that's why we say that our pipeline is never been stronger, frankly, and this was already in place before COVID."

            "name": "Tracey Travis",
            "content": "Thank you, Fabrizio and hello everyone. As a reminder, my commentary today is adjusted for the items that Rainey mentioned at the beginning of the call and net sales growth numbers are in constant currency. So, starting with the first quarter results, net sales decline 9% driven by the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our brick-and-mortar distribution throughout the world. We achieved strong growth in our global online channel, Mainland China, and the skincare category and delivered better than expected results in the travel retail channel and in North America. Other areas progressively improved compared to last quarter as retail doors reopened. The December 2019 acquisition of Dr. Jart contributed approximately three points of net sales growth. From a geographic standpoint, our Asia-Pacific region rose 7%, driven primarily by strong double-digit growth in skincare and the addition of Dr. Jart sales in Mainland China rose double-digits as sales in brick-and-mortar retail continued to improve. The pace of online sales growth in China was slower this quarter, following the highly successful 6.18 Mid-Year Shopping Festival programs last quarter. Most brands and channels rose double-digits and China. Korea rose high single-digits, excluding Dr. Jart and several smaller markets returned to growth as well. Sales in Japan declined due to a tough comparison to the prior year, in which sales grew nearly 20% as consumers bought ahead of an October 2019 VAT increase. The market has also suffered from softer in store traffic due to a second wave of COVID-19. Sales in Hong Kong continued to be depressed as well due to the pandemic. Net sales in our Europe, the Middle East, and Africa region declined 9% with virtually every market continuing to feel the effects of the pandemic. While online growth continued to be quite strong, brick-and-mortar traffic remained soft, heavily impacted by COVID-19, which also resulted in significantly lower tourism in key markets. Skincare sales in the region grew double-digits driven by travel retail, but were more than offset by declines in makeup and fragrance. The major Western markets of France, Spain, and the U.K. contributed the most to the decline in sales, as did the Middle East. Our global travel retail business was essentially flat as outstanding results in Greater China, particularly Hainan Island and Hong Kong, and sequential improvement in Korea offset the effects of the significant reduction in international travel. Additionally, the growth of pre-tail and the increase in duty free purchase limits in Hainan drove higher conversion rates. Net sales in the Americas declined 24% as virtually all markets in the region continue to be impacted by COVID-19. Online sales growth continued to be a bright spot rising over 40%, however, brick-and-mortar retail remain difficult, especially in department stores and in freestanding stores. From a category standpoint, skincare was the most resilient. Net sales grew 10%, driven by continued strong performance from the Este\u0301e Lauder and La Mer brands in Asia, including travel retail, as well as incremental sales from the acquisition of Dr. Jart. Net sales and makeup fells 32%, a significant sequential improvement from last quarter. Make up the seen the biggest impact from COVID-19, as many consumers continue to partially or fully work from home and forego social gatherings. Fragrance net sales declined 13%, a substantial improvement from last quarter. The category grew strongly in Asia, reflecting double-digit increases from both Tom Ford and Jo Malone London, as well as the recent launches of Kilian Paris and Fre\u0301de\u0301ric Malle in Mainland China. Bath, body, and home fragrances continue to perform very well. Our haircare net sales were essentially flat, declining only 1%, while stores and salons were not operating at full capacity during the quarter, the category benefited from exceptional innovation from Aveda, including the recent launch of Botanical Repair, as well as strong online sales. Our gross margin increased 20 basis points compared to the first quarter last year. Favorable category mix and lower costs for in-store testers were partially offset by negative currency impact. Operating expenses decreased 7% and the deleveraging effect of the sales decline caused operating expenses as a percent of sales to increase 80 basis points. Agile cost management and lower selling costs resulting from both channel mix and the impact of the COVID-19-related temporary furloughs and salary reductions on employee costs resulted in a 20% operating margin, which was just 60 basis points lower than the year ago quarter despite the lower sales. Diluted EPS of $1.44 decreased 14% compared to the prior year. EPS was higher than expected due to both improved sales performance as well as more proven cost management as doors reopened throughout the quarter. During the quarter, we generated $358 million in net cash flows from operating activities, which was above the prior year, due primarily to timing of working capital items. We invested $116 million in capital expenditures, repaid the remaining $750 million outstanding on our bank revolver, and paid $174 million in dividends. We also announced this morning a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.53 per share. Our plans under the post-COVID business acceleration plan are on track with approvals expected to accelerate in the second quarter and benefits beginning to flow later in our fiscal year. So, now let's turn to our outlook. We are pleased with the sequential improvement we saw in nearly every market as the world continues to manage the effects of the pandemic. The path to recovery is not expected to be smooth as cases of COVID-19 have begun to surge again in many markets, creating renewed restrictions on travel and social activities. We are mindful of the risk of a global recession or a slow economic recovery as government support measures in certain markets taper off. We also recognize macro risks, such as ongoing trade tensions, and political uncertainty. Nonetheless, prestige beauty remains a highly desirable product category as evidenced by the sequential improvement in sales trends we experienced this quarter. And we believe our multiple engines of growth strategy positions as well to return to strong global results when the impacts from the pandemic subside. With only one quarter of the year completed and the degree of uncertainty I just described, we are not providing explicit sales and EPS guidance for the full year. However, we will provide some underlying assumptions for the year. We continue to expect sequential quarterly sales improvement as the global recovery unfolds, assuming no significant second wave resulting in broad scale retail door closures again or other major disruptive events. And we do expect to return to sales growth as of the end -- as of the third quarter. Comparisons to our record performance in the past prior year first half will be difficult. Conversely, we expect sales and profit to grow significantly in the second half of the year against a period of considerable COVID-19 impacts, with particularly strong growth in the fourth quarter. The inclusion of six months of incremental sales from the acquisition of Dr. Jart should add about one to two percentage points to sales growth for the fiscal year, but remain slightly dilutive to profit for the year. We expect to close a number of our less productive freestanding retail stores and exit certain wholesale doors primarily in Western markets. While several of our retail customers are also reducing their store footprint, many of the unproductive doors are expected to close later in the fiscal year. Our gross margin is recovered from last quarters inefficiencies related to the sudden COVID-19 impact. Additionally, we continue to invest in increased capacity to support our strong skincare growth. We will continue to leverage a portion of the savings generated from our cost programs to support advertising and expanding services and capabilities to enable strong growth in our online channel. As I mentioned before, we increased our quarterly dividend rate by 10% to $0.53 per share. We also expect to reinstate share repurchases as we gain comfort that the recovery is more sustained. So, while the environment remains quite uncertain, we are providing guidance for the second quarter. For the quarter, we expect sales to decline between 4% and 6% in constant currency. As a reminder, we are comparing against the record prior year quarter where we delivered 16% sales growth and 21% EPS growth last year. We have a robust lineup of holiday offerings at a variety of attractive price points that are carefully targeted to relevant consumer trends we are seeing during this pandemic and we expect continued strong online sales on our retailers and on our own brand sites. The incremental sales from Dr. Jart are expected to add about two points to growth and currency is expected to be accredited by approximately one point. We expect second quarter ups of $1.45 to $1.60, reflecting the sales outlook, continued cost containment measure, and investment in key growth areas like online innovation and China. Currency is expected to add $0.02 to EPS and Dr. Jart is forecast to dilute EPS by $0.03. We will continue to leverage our multiple engines of growth to invest behind a strong recovery in the context of the macro environment. We are taking strategic actions to support long-term sustainable growth by investing appropriately for the long-term, while supporting the recovery in the near-term. With a more solid start to the fiscal year and mindful of continued macro volatility over the next several months, we look forward to leveraging the tremendous strength of our brands and driving a strong recovery as the market accommodates. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions now. Yes. And Lauren, as you indicated, I mean timing is will really impact that. So in terms of, when we expect door closures to occur. We've already had a number of wholesale door closers and freestanding door closures over the last few years, when you think about the number of retailers that have gone out of business, unfortunately, in the last couple of years. And certain retailers have also indicated their intent to close doors over the next couple of quarters. With our post-COVID acceleration program, we too will be closing doors over the next couple of quarters more towards the end of the year, as well as some freestanding stores. So there will be a timing issue where we do see pressure from under productive brick and mortar doors, while we see the uplift that Fabrizio spoke about from our online acceleration. And that's all embedded within the guidance that we've given certainly for the second quarter and, and we'll see how the second half of the year plays out. But that's certainly a dynamic that we will be managing in fiscal 2021 as the foreclosures are staged throughout the balance of the year and into fiscal 2022. And then in terms of the month or the second quarter, October came in, is coming in as we expected. So and it is reflected in our guidance. So I know we had starting in July, a little bit of a shipment to restart the business, given the fact that some of our inventory levels were low, particularly in North America we don't see anything like that in the second quarter. And as you probably know, Steve, October is the smaller of the three months in the second quarter, obviously, November and December with for us both Singles' Day in China and in Asia as well as holiday. November and December are by far the two bigger months. Yes, I mean, I think in -- on the last call, Jason, we indicated that we expected to get potentially to our fiscal 2019 margins by fiscal 2022. Now part of the post-COVID acceleration program, certainly is helping to accelerate the achievement of that. But I think that math is a little aggressive right now for fiscal 2023. As we think about the recovery of the business, and obviously, it all depends on how quickly we get back to your point normal as it relates to normal consumption from a brick-and-mortar standpoint, and where the balance of the channel mix plays out. So that's a little bit aggressive, but recognize that certainly given the cost actions we take as it relates to post-COVID acceleration to accelerate our brick-and-mortar productivity and therefore help our margin. And some of the favorable mix items that Lauren indicated earlier from the growth of online as well as when travel retail resumes, which is another factor for us. We had good travel retail performance quarter. Travel retail is another accretive channel for us in international travel whenever that resumes and what that looks like will also be a factor. So we're very comfortable that we will have margin progression. And we will get to the 19.5 that you're referencing. It's just a matter of timing. And the only thing I would add to that we had also very strong innovation. We spoke about the fact that the fragrance category has been a nice surprise for us and that has been driven by innovation, across the board with our fragrance brands and then obviously haircare with Aveda. Aveda has had a couple of very strong innovation launches this year that really has driven a lot of momentum for us in haircare and certainly helped from a recovery standpoint, where we did see some shifts in innovation and from a timing standpoint is in the makeup category understandably. So we do have strong programs lined up for the second half of the year, in addition to skincare and fragrance and hair care, also for our makeup category, hopefully, as people start to gradually wear more makeup and perhaps become more socially active that innovation will actually pan out to help to continue to grow that makeup category."

Today\u2019s call is being recorded and webcast. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Rainey Mancini.\nRainey Mancini: Hello.

During the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question, so we can respond to all of you within the time scheduled for this call. And now, I will turn the call over to Fabrizio.\nFabrizio Freda: Thank you, Rainey and hello to everyone. I am grateful to be with you today to reflect on our record results for fiscal year 2022 and discuss the drivers of our outlook for fiscal year 2023. We leveraged our strengths amid the prolonged pandemic, the invasion of Ukraine and the onset of higher inflation. Our multiple NGO growth strategy, flexible financial model and exceptional talent enabled us to deliver record performance. At the same time, we invested for long-term growth, reflecting our confidence in the vibrancy of prestige beauty now and in the future. We achieved better-than-expected results in our fourth quarter, leading to above guidance organic sales growth of 8% for fiscal year 2022. Reported sales rose 9% despite heightened foreign exchange pressure to end the year. Adjusted operating margin expanded 80 basis points to an all-time high of 19.7%. We realized this greater profitability even as our growth engines diversified beyond our highest margins categories. Fragrance, makeup and hair care delivered double-digit sales growth on a reported basis to complement our robust skin care business. Impressively, 9 brands contributed double-digit organic sales growth for the year despite the significant pressure from COVID-19 in Asia-Pacific in the fourth quarter. La Mer, Jo Malone London and Le Labo showcased the strength of our portfolio across our large, scaling and developing brands respectively. M\u00b7A\u00b7C, Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique powered makeup emerging renaissance, with double-digit gains in the category as Jon Malone London and Tom Ford Beauty elevated fragrance to new heights with striking growth. Our geographic diversity has been a distinct benefit during the pandemic allowing us to create and capture growth where opportunities presented themselves around the world. Asia-Pacific led growth in fiscal \u201820 and \u201821 as markets in the West were more negatively impacted by COVID-19, while the Americas and EMEA drove growth in 2022 as the East confronted renewed pressure from the virus. Today, our $17.7 billion in annual reported revenues tops pre-pandemic levels by 19% fueled by organic sales growth and enhanced by our acquisitions of Dr. Jart and DECIEM. Adjusted operating margin expanded 220 basis points over the 3 years. Our trusted brands with the hero products and sought-after innovation have thrived, while our increasingly flexible cost structure has served us well. Our focus on hero product has been a winning strategy. These high repeat loyalty-inducing products have grown significantly as a mix of our business since fiscal year 2019. Throughout, we have continued to innovate to propel our hero strategy for the years ahead. Innovation served as a powerful catalyst for growth this year, representing over 25% of sales once again. Our newness exceeded consumer desires due to our exceptional data analytics, R&D and creative capabilities. La Mer\u2019s Hydrating Infusion Emulsion, Est\u00e9e Lauder [indiscernible] Serum and Macstack Mascara are among our breakthrough launches this year, driving favorable earned media value and strong new consumer acquisition. Turning to category performance. Fragrance grew a stunning 32% organically for the year. Jo Malone London, Tom Ford Beauty, Le Labo, KILIAN PARIS and Editions de Parfums Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle, each rose strong double-digit and expanded in every region, including excellent results in travel retail in EMEA. Est\u00e9e Lauder brand launched the luxury collection and airing contributed double-digit gains. The outstanding performance of our luxury and artisanal portfolio affirms our strategic pivot to this portfolio affirms our strategic pivot to this accretive segment of the category. Consumers\u2019 behaviors during the pandemic reinforced fragrance as part of self-care and solidified online as the destination for the category to explore, learn and purchase. Our brands stepped up to create and leverage these new dynamics. We capitalize on the recovery in brick-and-mortar in many markets realizing high levels of engagement in freestanding stores, while online continue to prosper for the category. Makeup remitted a powerful growth engine in fiscal year 2022. Strong double-digit organic sales gains in the Americas and EMEA more than offset a double-digit decline in Asia-Pacific. As markets in the west reopened, leading to more social and professional use educations, the makeup renaissance emerged. Our brand excelled with innovative artists as well as new products, which focused on performance, ingredient narratives and skinifications of makeup. We leveraged increased traffic in brick-and-mortar, which allowed us to reestablish our well-loved services in store to resonate the recent growth in services. Hair care proved to be a valuable growth engine, contributing double-digit organic sales growth. The unique value proposition and go-to-market strategy for each of Aveda and Bumble and bumble resonated with consumers who increasingly expect the benefits of quality products and performance-based ingredients. The skin care category was the most impacted from the resurgence of COVID-19 in Asia-Pacific in the second half of the fiscal year as restriction reduced traffic in brick-and-mortar as well as travel retail and also temporarily curtailed our distribution capacity in Mainland China. In this context, we delivered solid results as excellent performance from La Mer, Clinique, Bobbi Brown offset pressure from other brands. La Mer had a remarkable year. Consumers around the world gravitated to its icon and robust innovations, embracing newness like the Hydrating Infused Emulsion and the upgrade to The Treatment Lotion to expand their regiments. Genaissance de la Mer lifted sales further as consumers traded up to the brand Ulta luxury franchise for its artisanal quality and parallel efficacy and high-curated experiences. Clinique and Bobbi Brown success in skin care demonstrated the execution of our sophisticated hero strategy to drive strong repeat and consumer loyalty. Clinique heroes across categories from makeup remover to serum to moisturizer provided it with a winning formula while Bobbi Brown\u2019s global and regional hero philosophy is driving its mix of business in skin care much higher. Looking now at channels. Both brick-and-mortar and online served as growth engines for the year as we pushed exciting initiatives to amplify our omnichannel capability. Let me share a few of the highlights. Brick-and-mortar rebounded strongly in the America and EMEA as specialty multi freestanding stores and department store all contributed. Our Post-COVID Business Acceleration Program enabled us to improve the productivity and sustainability of our brand building, experiential brick-and-mortar footprint as intended. Online grew mid single-digits organically led by double-digit growth in Asia-Pacific. DECIEM high online penetration boosted reported sales growth in the channel to double-digits. Our online channel encompassing brand.com, third-party platforms, pure-play retailers and retail.com is now far more than twice as big pre-pandemic fiscal \u201819. China and the U.S., which already high online penetration, have expanded further, while markets in EMEA have seen a surge in online penetration that are now able to realize the benefits of scale. During the year, we diversified in high-growth channels globally to expand our consumer reach. Est\u00e9e Lauder, Clinique and Origins initially launched on JD in China. And given the insights gained as well as new consumer acquisition trends, we introduced more brands on JD. Jo Malone London and La Mer launched on Lazada in Southeast Asia and many brands participated in the emerging Ulta Beauty at Target and Sephora calls partnership in the U.S., both in store and online. We continue to innovate across the online ecosystem to generate trial and repeat. In Latin America, which has historically been a strong market for direct selling, we leverage WhatsApp and drove social selling to represent 30% of online sales in the region. Around the world, our beauty advisers and makeup artists became content creators for always-on creation across social media platforms like TikTok. This showcases the powerful evolution of the reach and scale of our expert advice, which now stands well beyond brick-and-mortar. We also advanced our omnichannel strategy meaningfully this year. In North America, most of our freestanding stores are now equipped with fulfillment capability. We also began to stand up these features in EMEA and Asia-Pacific. These new capabilities are driving higher average order values and convincing up-sell trends. At the same time, we extended the reach of our loyalty programs globally, introducing programs in Japan, Italy and Mexico and expanding offering in other markets across EMEA and Asia-Pacific. Here too, the results are compelling. We are realizing greater purchase frequency, higher level of retention from consumer engaged in loyalty programs. During the fiscal year, we also progressed our ESG goals and commitments. We continue to make strides on our climate action strategy, including the expansion of our renewable energy portfolio across our direct operations globally and we are recognized by a leading NGO for our commitment to source 100% renewable electricity. In packaging, we set a more ambitious goal to increase the post-consumer recycled content of our packaging to 25% or more by the end of 2025 and set a new goal to reduce the amount of virgin petroleum packaging to 50% or less by the end of 2030. We expanded employee resource groups, a great source of community and unity. Our network of Black leaders and executives launched in Brazil, while we welcome [ph] our group of LGBTQIA+ employees launched in EMEA. We created a group for our ageless employees and continue to scale our reverse mentoring program globally, pairing more junior talent with senior leaders to share insight and perspectives on trends to drive better business decision and faster career development. We brought our unique signature women leadership program, open doors to our international markets with continued great success in promoting our next generation of women leaders. We realized important progress with the [indiscernible] leadership development program. Its inaugural class has already achieved high level of career mobility in the forms of promotions and new roles for Black employees. We are encouraged by these initial results and look forward to continued success from this sponsorship program, which we created for equitable advancement and professional development of our Black talent. Before I talk about the year ahead, let me conclude on fiscal year 2022 by speaking about DECIEM, which complemented our organic sales growth. The ordinary DECIEM\u2019s ingredient-based brand diversified in exciting ways over the last few months. The brand launched in India and Malaysia, expanded its hair care offering and also introduced Multi-Peptide Lash & Brow Serum to extend its authorities in treatment. From its innovation exceeding expectation to outstanding initial results in Nike in India, the ordinary entered fiscal year 2023 with promising opportunities. Now for the future, we refreshed our 10-year\u2019s Compass to help steer our ambitions and investment for the next decade. The Compass reinforced our confidence showcasing the abundant growth opportunities ahead. The drivers are many led by growing middle class globally and most especially in emerging markets, expanding usage across consumer segment, including ageless and men and online expansion, fostering consumer access and reach. From the Compass, we distilled our 3-year strategy. As we look across the next 3 years, we expect to deliver more balanced growth across categories and regions. Near-term, the pandemic and macro factors will likely lead to more valuable growth by category and regions. We are very confident in the strength of our company and in the vibrancy of prestige beauty. For fiscal year 2023, we expect to deliver strong organic sales growth fueled by our diversified growth engines and enticing innovation and to take the opportunity in a volatile year to continue investing for our exciting future to build global share. While the external challenges are many, including inflation, geopolitical uncertainty and currency headwinds, the enduring desirability of our brands with their hero products at high repeat rates is powerful. Additionally, our more effective cost structure, pricing power and strong cash generation should afford us the flexibility to successfully navigate the ongoing complex environment. Innovation is poised to be a catalyst for growth and we began the year with exciting news. Let me share insights about two skin care launches. Est\u00e9e Lauder upgraded Advanced Night Repair Eye Supercharged gel cream, addresses the signs of eye agings and reflects consumer modern lifestyles of launch screen times and environmental stressors. Offering notable incremental benefits from the original product, this launch demonstrates the pricing power of innovation. Clinique Smart Clinical Repair line extended its fiscal 2022 innovation streak with the launch of Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream. The moisturizer is coupled with the powerful new claims for Smart Clinical Repair Serum to drive gains in this hero franchise. This year, we expect to reignite growth engines in Asia-Pacific as the pressure of COVID-19 abates. We anticipate in-store traffic levels to gradually improve in Mainland China, allowing brick-and-mortar to return to growth to complement ongoing strength online and for tourism trends to Hainan to ultimately accelerate from the most recent post, which began last week. We are confident in the long-term growth opportunity in Mainland China, evidenced by our expansion into almost 100 new doors and 3 additional cities in fiscal year 2022 as well as our introduction of Aveda last month. We are thrilled to enter the hair care category with Aveda, which is vegan and Leaping Bunny approved as the brand launched on Tmall and opened its first freestanding store in the market. Fiscal 2023 is set to be a monumental year for us as of our Shanghai innovation lab opens, advancing our ambition to best creates for the Chinese consumers and we begin limited production in our new manufacturing facility near Tokyo, which is our first ever in Asia-Pacific. With these two strategic initiatives, we expect to benefit over the next few years from increased speed-to-market and by further expanding our momentum with outstanding locally relevant innovation in this vibrant region. For the Americas and EMEA, we anticipate ongoing strength from our growth engines across categories and channels as well as across developed and emerging markets given the broad-based gains of fiscal year 2022. For makeup, which is a vital category in both regions, the emergence of the makeup renaissance, give us great confidence going into fiscal year 2023. In North America, and particularly, our focus turns to granular consumer growth opportunity as we have refined our distribution. To close, we delivered excellent performance in fiscal year 2022, achieving record results while advancing initiatives for consumer acquisition, engagement and high-touch services and experiences to drive trial and repeat levels even higher. Today, our business is not only far bigger and more profitable than the pre-pandemic fiscal year 2019, but our growth drivers are more diversified. Our R&D and innovation capabilities are more robust and our cost structure is more flexible. While the year ahead more certainly has its external challenges, our company is poised for a bright future as the best diversified pure player in prestige beauty with the most talented and passionate employees to whom I extend my deepest gratitude. I will now turn the call over to Tracey.\nTracey Travis: Thank you, Fabrizio and hello everyone. I will briefly cover the fiscal 2022 fourth quarter and full year results, followed by our thoughts on the outlook for fiscal 2023. Our fourth quarter organic net sales fell 8%, a bit better than we expected, reflecting the disruptions in China related to COVID restrictions, including travel retail in Hainan as well as the suspension of our commercial business in Russia and Ukraine. These matters more than offset continued growth from the recovery in the Americas and the rest of the EMEA region. Reported sales growth included approximately 1 percentage point from the addition of sales from DECIEM, while currency translation negatively impacted growth by approximately 3 percentage points. From a regional perspective, net sales in the Americas rose 9% organically led by double-digit increases in makeup and fragrance. Consumers continued their return to brick-and-mortar, leading to strong growth in freestanding retail and specialty multi-stores. We grew sales in nearly every market in the region, with particular strength in Canada and across Latin America. Net sales in our Europe, the Middle East and Africa region decreased 9% organically driven almost entirely by the disruptions in travel retail in China and the suspension of business in Russia and Ukraine. Of the remaining markets in the region, 10 rose double-digit as tourists returned to the region and consumer traffic and brick-and-mortar retail thrived. The makeup, fragrance and hair care categories rose strong double-digits in EMEA, while the decline in skin care reflected the soft travel retail sales in Asia. Global travel retail, which is primarily reported in this region, declined in Asia due to the COVID restrictions in China. Hainan, in particular, was impacted as stores were closed a portion of the quarter, travel was curtailed to the island and courier services for online deliveries were disrupted. However, travel retail in European markets and in the Americas rose triple-digits as airport traffic returned and doors in the channel reopened. Net sales in the Asia-Pacific region fell 19% organically. Greater China and Korea net sales were the most impacted by the COVID restrictions. Hardest hit was Shanghai, where the city-wide lockdown lasted 2 months, impacting our distribution capacity serving all of China through the end of May. Overall, our brands performed well for the important 6/18 holiday festival and maintained top rankings across the beauty space on both Tmall and JD. Elsewhere in Asia, there were some other bright spots. Malaysia, Japan, the Philippines and Vietnam continued to recover and have begun to reopen to tourism. Looking now at net sales by product category, fragrance led organic growth, with net sales rising 22% versus prior year. The fragrance category grew double-digits across all regions. Luxury fragrances continue to resonate with consumers looking for indulgence and our brands, including Tom Ford Beauty, Jo Malone London and La Labo were once again star performers. Net sales in makeup rose 8% organically driven by the continued recovery and increased usage occasions in Western markets, where makeup is generally the largest category. M\u00b7A\u00b7C and Clinique were top brand performers driven by hero products like MAC Studio Fix and the newly launched Macstack Mascara as well as Clinique\u2019s Almost Lipstick in Black Honey. Continued success and expansion in specialty multi-doors is also aiding category growth. Hair care net sales grew 5% organically. Excellent performance from Bumble and bumble in specialty multi contributed to growth. The launch of Aveda\u2019s vegan hair color in EMEA and a successful activation around the brand\u2019s hero and body franchise in Korea also aided category growth. Net sales in skin care were the most impacted by the COVID-related restrictions in China, affecting Greater China, Asian travel retail and Korea. Skin care continues to represent approximately two-thirds of our business in the Asia Pacific region. Net sales fell 21% in the quarter due to the disruption of the Shanghai distribution center, with the greatest impact felt by Est\u00e9e Lauder and La Mer brands. Skin care growth benefited from the addition of DECIEM sales in the quarter by approximately 3 percentage points. Our gross margin declined 370 basis points compared to the fourth quarter last year driven primarily by factors affecting our supply chain. Global transportation delays, port congestion, labor and container shortages and higher costs for both ocean and air transport have increasingly pressured our cost of goods. Unfavorable category mix from softer skin care sales also contributed to the decline. Operating expenses decreased 9% driven by the curtailment of spending this quarter as COVID restrictions sharply reduced store traffic in China, including Hainan. We delivered operating income of $207 million for the quarter compared to $385 million in the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share of $0.42 included $0.03 dilution from the acquisition of DECIEM. Shifting now to our full year results. Giving the volatility experienced throughout the year, the results reflect the benefit derived from the diversification of our top line growth as well as the incredible agility of our teams and their ability to effectively manage costs while also simultaneously investing selectively for future growth. Net sales rose 8% organically, with double-digit gains in three out of four product categories and two out of three regions. Sales of our products online continued to thrive even as brick-and-mortar recovered, rising 11% for the year and representing 28% of sales. Among brick-and-mortar retail, most channels grew double digit, while department stores ended the year down slightly as pressure from COVID restrictions in Asia offset growth in other regions. And our business in travel retail also grew, ending fiscal 2022 at 27% of sales. Our gross margin fell 60 basis points to 75.8%. Favorable pricing and currency were more than offset by higher supply chain costs, which were more pronounced in the back half of the year, the impact of the acquisition of DECIEM and higher costs for new products and sets. Operating expenses declined 150 basis points to 56% of sales. Disciplined expense management and general and administrative costs was the largest contributor to the decline. The changes in our channel mix continue to reduce selling costs. And additionally, we continue to drive more effective resource allocation in our advertising and promotional mix. These favorable trends were partially offset by increased shipping costs. During the year, we continue to create more flexibility in our cost structure to absorb inflation in wages, media and logistics. We achieved significant savings from our cost initiatives, including the post-COVID business acceleration program. This has enabled us to realize great expense leverage while also reinvesting in areas that support profitable growth, resulting in an overall improvement in our operating margin. Our full year operating margin was 19.7%, representing an 80 basis point improvement over last year. This improvement includes the absorption of 60 basis points of dilution from DECIEM. Our effective tax rate for the year was 21.3%, a 260 basis point increase over the prior year, primarily driven by a lower current year tax benefit associated with share-based compensation and the prior year favorable impact of the U.S. government issuance of final GILTI tax regulations that provided for a retroactive high-tax exception. Net earnings rose 11% to $2.6 billion, and diluted EPS increased 12% to $7.24. Earnings per share includes $0.04 accretion from currency translation and $0.05 dilution from the acquisition of DECIEM. The Post-COVID Business Acceleration Program is wrapping up, with final estimated restructuring charges of $500 million to $515 million at the top end of our original projections. We are pleased with the progress we achieved from this program. We realigned our brand portfolio by exiting four designer fragrance brands as well as the BECCA and [indiscernible] brands, and we are streamlining our market distribution for Smashbox and GLAMGLOW to improve their long-term viability. We optimized our brick-and-mortar distribution network. We have been and will continue to close underproductive freestanding retail stores as we rebalance our distribution network. By the end of fiscal 2023, we expect to have closed nearly 250 freestanding retail stores under the program. We\u2019ve also rationalized department store counters and other retail locations, improving our ability to focus our efforts on driving more profitable omni-channel opportunities in our remaining distribution. We also approved initiatives to optimize our organization across regions and throughout global functions to reduce complexity, leverage our scale and enhance our go-to-market capabilities. When we are finished executing the program, we expect a net reduction of between 2,500 and 3,000 positions globally. We expect to execute the remaining projects to achieve estimated annualized gross savings of between $390 million and $410 million before taxes beginning in fiscal 2024. A portion of these savings have been and will continue to be reinvested in capabilities that sustain our long-term growth, including data analytics, online and advertising. Turning now to our cash flow. We generated $3 billion in cash from operations, a 16% decrease from the $3.6 billion in the prior year period. The primary driver was higher working capital due to the end of year disruptions related to the pandemic the past few years as well as inventory to support future growth and to help mitigate the supply chain challenges we have faced in certain raw material and componentry areas. We utilized $1 billion for capital improvements, an increase of approximately $400 million over last year. We continue to invest in capacity and other supply chain improvements. We increased consumer-facing investments to support in-store experiences and recovery markets. We renovated office space, and we continue to invest in information technology. We also returned cash to stockholders at an accelerated pace this year as the need for more stringent cash conservation subsided with the progression of the recovery. During the year, we repurchased 7.4 million shares for $2.3 billion, and we paid $840 million in dividends, reflecting the 13% increase in our dividend rate that became effective in our fiscal second quarter. All in all, we delivered a strong year despite significant disruptions, including continued outbreaks of COVID, higher inflation, supply chain constraints and the invasion in Ukraine. And we also continue to invest in foundational capabilities for the future, including new production capacity and innovation to support growth. Now looking ahead to fiscal 2023, we believe that the prestige beauty category has ample opportunities for continued strong growth. Global prestige beauty is expected to grow mid to high single-digits driven by the continued recovery and the gradual reopening of the remaining market impacted by COVID restrictions. Additionally, we look forward to the continued resumption of international travel, especially in Hainan and the rest of Asia. We are concerned, however, that the recovery this fiscal year will once again not be a smooth one. Record inflation and the threat of recession or slowdown in many markets could temporarily dampen consumer enthusiasm and is causing some retailers to be more cautious regarding inventories. The strengthening dollar is putting pressure on our international earnings. Additionally, heightened geopolitical tensions could prove to be disruptive. With that backdrop in mind, for the full fiscal year, organic net sales are forecasted to grow 7% to 9%. We discontinued four designer fragrance licenses at the end of fiscal 2022. These brands generated $250 million in sales in fiscal 2022. In fiscal \u201823, we will sell some remaining inventory to the new licensees, primarily in the first half. Sales from both years will be excluded from our organic growth figures. At current levels, currency is projected to be a significant drag on our reported results in fiscal \u201823 as the U.S. dollar strengthens against key currencies. Based on July 31 spot rates at 1.018 for the euro, 1.215 for the pound, 6.746 for the Chinese yuan and 13 03 for the Korean won, we expect currency translation to dilute reported sales growth for the full fiscal year by 3 percentage points as well as an additional 1 point due to the impacts of foreign currency transactions in key international travel retail markets. There are a few other items impacting our sales growth in fiscal 2023. Our list price increases are expected to add approximately 5.5 points of growth, helping to offset inflationary cost pressures. We take most of our pricing actions at the beginning of our fiscal year. New distribution, including new doors in existing markets, new markets for certain brands and expansion on new online platforms, could add another 2 points. Conversely, the loss of sales in Russia and Ukraine are expected to trim about 1 percentage point from sales growth. We plan to continue to drive margin expansion through operational efficiencies and cost savings while fueling additional advertising investment where appropriate.  Our full year effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23%. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $7.39 and $7.54 before restructuring and other charges. This includes approximately $0.20 of dilution from currency translation. In constant currency, we expect EPS to rise by 5% to 7%. The impact from foreign currency transactions in key international travel retail markets is also expected to negatively impact adjusted diluted earnings per common share by \u2013 growth by 6 percentage points. At this time, we expect organic sales for our first quarter to fall 4% to 6%. The impact of sales from certain designer license exits are expected to dilute reported growth by approximately 1 point and currency is expected to be dilutive by approximately 3 points. Our first quarter sales are expected to be negatively impacted by continued COVID restrictions in China and Hainan. As you may recall, last year, we mentioned that some of our retailers in North America secured holiday shipments earlier due to supply chain concern, contributing 1.5 points to our growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. This year, retailers in the U.S. have been tightening their inventories, causing our net sales to trail retail sale. We expect China and travel retail in APAC to gradually improve throughout the first half of the fiscal year as COVID restrictions lift. And comparisons should ease in the back half of the year as we lap the invasion of Ukraine and the significant impact of COVID restrictions in China. We expect first quarter EPS of $1.22 to $1.32. Currency translation is expected to be dilutive to EPS by $0.04. The impact from foreign currency transactions in key international travel retail markets is expected to negatively impact adjusted diluted earnings per common share growth by 5 percentage points. In closing, we remain confident about the long-term prospects for global prestige beauty and in our strategy to outpace industry growth. Our multiple engines of growth delivered in fiscal 2022, and we anticipate this more diversified growth can continue in the coming year. And importantly, we continue to reinforce the fundamental drivers of our business that both enable and contribute to continued strong future sales and EPS growth. I would like to close by extending our heartfelt gratitude to our employees around the globe for continuing to deliver our results during this challenging macro environment. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will be happy to take your questions at this time.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDara Mohsenian: Hi, good morning.\nTracey Travis: Good morning, Dara.\nFabrizio Freda: Good morning, Dara.\nDara Mohsenian: So I have a two-part question on China. First, just on the detail side. Can you just give us a bit more of a sense on what you\u2019ve factored in to both Q1 and the full year guidance on COVID lockdowns? Are you assuming the city restrictions that are in place today continue throughout Q1? And then what do you assume post Q1 in the balance of the year in terms of lingering shutdowns? And then second, it\u2019s very hard for us to judge externally your underlying market share performance in China ex supply issues. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s difficult for you also. But just any perspective on underlying market share trends as supply returns to normal, perhaps so far in fiscal Q1, that\u2019d be helpful. And if you expect any of the supply issues recently to have an impact on your forward share at all. Thanks.\nTracey Travis: So I\u2019ll start, Dara, regarding China and what we\u2019ve baked into our assumptions. Clearly, the first quarter, we are seeing some intermittent disruptions. Our distribution center is open. We\u2019re actually \u2013 and opened in June, as we mentioned. So we were well prepared for the 6/18 holiday festival, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks. We are still seeing some intermittent shutdowns, not whole city shutdowns in China at the moment. So that is still disrupting brick-and-mortar retail. So we have factored that in, certainly to our Q1 expectations for the China market. As it relates to Hainan, as we mentioned also in our prepared remarks, and I\u2019m sure you all have seen, Hainan is experiencing a lockdown right now. So, all of the doors are closed. Courier services as well have been suspended for online orders. And we\u2019re obviously monitoring that day by day, but that is something that began in the month \u2013 at the beginning of the month of August. And right now, we\u2019re expecting that to continue through the end of the month of August with some resumption in September, but not full resumption in September, recognizing that as this situation continues to impact the market, there will be some level of reticence for consumers to travel. But we certainly expect that, that will improve in the upcoming months. So I think first quarter and first half, we are expecting some level of muted performance in the region related to these issues. We do expect second quarter to be better than first quarter. And then in the second half, obviously, we\u2019re anniversarying quite a bit of disruption in the fourth quarter, some of which, again, in the third quarter for both Hainan as well as China. And we do expect that we will see strong growth in the second half. For the full year, we do expect China to grow double digit. And so again, we are \u2013 it is a market that we know there is very strong demand for prestige beauty and for our products and the same with Hainan as well. So we are just navigating through these first few months of the year until we get on the other side in the second half.\nFabrizio Freda: And I\u2019ll comment on market share. As Tracey just said, we do expect for the full year, China to go back growing double digit. We expect strong recovery in Hainan in the second part, in the second semester of the fiscal year, for sure, a gradual recovery before. That\u2019s our assumption, which obviously is going to give us also results in market share. So speaking about the last \u2013 the quarter four, to be clear, the market in China was down 10%. Est\u00e9e Lauder Company was down 13%. So we lost 1 point of market share. We are now at 23%, so very strong market share. I would like to argue that given the lockdown of our distribution center, the impossibility of serving for almost 2 months, our consumers losing 1 point of market share temporarily is actually showing that already in June, we started recovery with an outstanding 6/18 event and the management of this. And then to speak about what we are going to do further in the next 6 months to recover the market share we lost because of the distribution down, first of all, strong brand portfolio brands. We are going to reinforce it with the launch of Aveda that just started, which is a very important launch entering the hair care, big and growing category, the luxury hair care, big and growing category in China. We are going to double down on Tmall and entering new successful online distribution that we started with JD, where we still have opportunity of deploying more brands in other areas where we are testing or distributing. We have very strong innovation starting with what we discussed in the remarks, which is the Est\u00e9e Lauder Advanced Repair eye product, which eye is one of the most important categories in China, and to be clear, it\u2019s one of the most important recruitment strategies is eye products in the market. As you know, we are opening an R&D center this year. And so we are investing at even stronger innovations in the future. We are getting a great strategy to win in key shopping moments. I think that we had demonstrated in ATC in June for the 18/6 event is extraordinary. Our team, we are coming out of 40 days down in Shanghai, and they were able to operate successfully a very complex and important event. We are going to do the same with 11 November, hopefully, now in the second quarter. We are also improving our distribution in brick-and-mortar. We are opening new cities and new doors in the existing fast-growing cities. We have a new distribution center that we have opened. Actually, we opened this Friday in Guangzhou to mitigate risk of future distribution disruptions, and then this will turn into a definite ongoing new second big distribution center in the beginning of 2023. We believe the Hainan, despite the current lockdown, which is obviously painful in the short-term, but is a super strong opportunity for the long-term. The power of Hainan in the future remains intact and we have strong presence and market share in this operation. And I want to say we have an amazing local team, and this local team, they have been able to manage through these difficulties extremely well, and we believe that strength on which we can count in the future to continue building market share over time. Thank you for the question.\nOperator: The next question is from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nLauren Lieberman: Great, thanks. Good morning, everyone. I was struck to mention that pricing this year expecting to be north of 5%. And if I then layer in what you suggested could be a contribution from distribution, it suggests very limited, let\u2019s call it, like-for-like door volume growth. So just I was curious if you could comment on that because thinking about \u2013 you mentioned, Fabrizio, recruitment, you\u2019re talking about launching Aveda. It just feels like there is a lot happening that should still be driving unit growth. And so I was curious if you could comment on that. Thank you.\nTracey Travis: Yes, Lauren. So I\u2019ll start. Good morning. We did call out, obviously, in our prepared remarks and in the press release a couple of adjustments in our revenue numbers this year. So we did exit our prestige designer licensed businesses. Basically, we ended those licenses. Our focus is on luxury fragrance and artisanal fragrance. And so we did let those licenses expire. That is about 1 point of growth. The other point is related to the suspension of our operations in Russia and Ukraine. And so that is also contributing another point, if you will, to adjusted growth and to the suppression of growth that you\u2019re referring to. And then lastly, the currency impact on revenue also impacts us in terms of our growth algorithm. So if you adjust for all of those items, it\u2019s about 6 points of difference between what we\u2019ve guided for the full year and where we expect \u2013 where we would expect to end if none of those events had happened. So that is the reason why the growth looks a bit muted even with the 5.5% pricing. The other thing I would say again is we are starting the year with a fair amount of disruption as we just spoke about in some of our very important markets. And we are assuming a more gradual recovery, and that, too, impacts our unit growth.\nOperator: The next question is from Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nNik Modi: Yes, thank you. Good morning, everyone. I just wanted to revisit China and just given some of the economic data that we\u2019ve been seeing recently and curious if you\u2019ve witnessed any evidence of any economic pressure impacting consumption. And I know it\u2019s hard with all the noise of COVID and the shutdowns, but perhaps maybe some of the markets where you haven\u2019t seen a big COVID impact, maybe you can share what trends would look like. Any perspective would be helpful?\nFabrizio Freda: Yes. Hi, Nik. No, actually, we don\u2019t feel this. It\u2019s probably the prestige cosmetic luxury cosmetic segment is more protected because of the big passion of consumers for this category. And as you know, the clear preference for the preference for the Chinese consumer for the prestige solutions, which is growing very fast for years now. And the percentage of prestige for the total market keeps improving. So, we don\u2019t see this. The proof I can give you is that the top of the ranges are growing the fastest also on our brand. La Mer is one of our fastest-growing brands as an example. So, the \u2013 and importantly, the market is very active when there are no restrictions, when there is no issues. So, we don\u2019t see any impact \u2013 obviously, we are prudent in the assumptions we are making on the China economy development in the short-term as everyone is. But we don\u2019t see a very big impact on our business in absence of COVID restrictions situations.\nOperator: The next question is from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nRupesh Parikh: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, Tracey, I was wondering if you guys can provide more color on the interplay between gross margins and SG&A for the year.\nTracey Travis: Yes. Obviously, we experienced some gross margin pressure in Q4. It was related to some of the activity that we had to manage through in terms of getting product to market and some of the disruption that\u2019s in general in the supply chain. So \u2013 and as we think about the first quarter and the guidance that we have provided, we do expect gross margins to be down as well in the first quarter, not to the same extent as they were in the fourth quarter, and that will gradually improve throughout the year as we are anniversarying some of those disruptions. So, for the full year, we are expecting gross margins to be around flat at the moment. But the first \u2013 it\u2019s a tale of two halves in terms of the first half and some of the things we are anniversarying and some of the pressures that we are seeing on the business. But we do expect for the full year gross margin to be flat. In terms of SG&A, again, we expect that we will continue to get good SG&A leverage. I think we are incredibly proud of what our team was able to deliver this past fiscal year and fiscal 2022 in terms of the expense leverage that we were able to deliver. And it\u2019s something that we are keenly focused on while also focused on investing in the important areas that drive our long-term growth algorithm. So, those are things that we continue to manage throughout the year, and we will get continued expense leverage this year.\nOperator: The next question is from Mark Astrachan of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nMark Astrachan: Yes. Thanks and good morning everybody. Wanted to follow-up sort of directionally on the last question on gross margin, if you take a look at it even pre-COVID, pre-supply chain and inflationary pressures adjust for some of the accounting changes kind of going back 3 years, 4 years ago, it\u2019s still kind of down over the last 5 years, and your expectations were flat this year. I guess kind of the puts and takes, which you are taking out of price. You have got a post-COVID business acceleration plan, so there is productivity, there is a mix shift in the business towards direct-to-consumer. I guess maybe if you could talk directionally about kind of what has led the progression down, but more importantly, kind of where do you think it can go over time. Is that high-70s level achievable again? Why or why not, that would be helpful. Thank you.\nTracey Travis: Yes. I think we have seen over the timeframe that you are speaking about. And yes, we definitely had accounting changes that impacted the gross margin between expenses and gross margin. But we have seen differences in the business in terms of our mix of business. And so fundamentally \u2013 and I know it\u2019s important to understand what\u2019s going on in gross margin, but really, what we focus on is operating margin. And as we have seen channel shifts and market shifts, etcetera, those have impacted the gross margin, perhaps in some cases \u2013 in some of those cases, more negatively, but they have impacted the operating margin quite positively. So, at the end of the day, we are focused on delivering operating margin and profitable growth. In terms of whether or not we expect that we will get back to higher levels of gross margin, it is something that we are working on with our supply chain. So, between our direct procurement programs, between some of the things we are doing in transportation, the opening of our Japanese plant, which should allow us to be not only closer to the consumer, but even to some of our suppliers for inbound freight should also help us from a gross margin standpoint. I am not going to commit that we are going to get back to the gross margins that we were at 5 years or 6 years ago, but do know that there are things that we see that are opportunities that we are also working on and very close partnership with our supply chain.\nOperator: The next question is from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nSteve Powers: Thank you and good morning. I wanted to focus on makeup, if I could. Obviously, the trajectory there is promising. You have been talking about the makeup renaissance for a while, and it directionally is \u2013 seems to be taking shape. But we are still below \u201819 levels by a fair degree. So, I guess really, the question is, sort of what\u2019s your expectation for that recovery to continue the progress you expect to make over the next 12 months? And to some extent, when do you expect to be able to kind of converge with those pre-pandemic levels? And as we talk about that, I am mostly focused on the top line, but obviously, profitability comes alongside that. And your thoughts on rebuilding profitability in makeup alongside the top line would be helpful as well? Thank you.\nTracey Travis: Okay. So, let me \u2013 I will start. In terms of makeup, we continue to be quite bullish on the makeup category. We did see a recovery, particularly in our Western markets. So, part of the strength that we saw this year \u2013 this past fiscal year in terms of the growth in makeup and the improvement in margin that we saw in makeup was related to the recovery, in particular, in brick-and-mortar in our Western markets, so in the Americas as well as in Europe. We are still challenged a bit in makeup in our Eastern markets because of some of the disruption that\u2019s going on, in particular, in brick-and-mortar. And \u2013 but we expect makeup to gradually improve as the disruption in those markets improve, and similar to Western markets, as consumers resume their normal social and professional occasions. So, that is our expectation in terms of when we will get back to fiscal \u201819 levels for makeup, depending on the disruptions this year. It may take another year or so. But our makeup brands have fantastic innovation for this year, in particular, the MAC brand, but others as well. And so we are very encouraged in terms of makeup. As it relates to the margin, the makeup category has been particularly hit by the pandemic that is now going on for 3 years because of the brick-and-mortar distribution of makeup, and in particular, with a few of our makeup brands where services in-store are very well loved by our consumers and the in-store experience, that took \u2013 that was a bit of a challenge with doors closed and with traffic down. And traffic is still down in brick-and-mortar, even in the markets that are in recovery, traffic has not recovered to prior levels, but it\u2019s well on its way to do so. So, I think one of the reasons why we took some of the actions we did with the post-COVID business acceleration program is take a point of view to your point of what that will look like when things are stabilized and what the mix between brick-and-mortar and online should be and took proactive measures to close some underproductive doors, and largely, that will help the makeup category. Most \u2013 many of those stores were makeup doors. Some of them were Origins stores. Some of them were Bobbi doors, actually. So, that should continue to help the makeup category as volume returns to \u2013 in particular, brick-and-mortar.\nFabrizio Freda: Yes. I just want to add that the makeup will continue to follow the user education on makeup, so the normalization from a consumer standpoint. This is happening, but it\u2019s not yet up to the levels it used to be. So, it\u2019s going there and will be there. So, a lot of benefits are still in front of us and not behind us. So, we will see further progress over time, particularly in the East where the COVID lockdowns are still creating issues, not only in distribution, but also in consumer usage of makeup. The other important thing is that makeup is really a blend [ph] is linked to services. And so to have the proper experience, you need critical mass per store. And the critical mass per store is dependent on traffic, as Tracey said. So, this is also getting better. The renaissance is if you want at the beginning. So, more progress is in front of us. And that progress in particularly would also impact positively the bottom line and the profitability of the category. So, we are in the right direction, and we are not yet done on this.\nOperator: The next question is from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nBryan Spillane: Thanks operator. Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking the question. So, I just wanted to ask \u2013 I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks, you talked a bit about product innovation for \u201823. And I think also in the press release, you talked about targeted distribution opportunities. So, can you just give us a little bit more color on those two items? And I guess one of the things I am interested in is just, is it sequentially \u2013 especially on the product innovation, is there sequentially \u2013 do we expect, I guess more of a contribution from new products or product innovation in \u201823 versus what we have seen in the last 2 years just because the environment is a little bit maybe more accepting of that? So, just some color on those two items would be helpful. Thank you.\nFabrizio Freda: Yes. I will start on the product innovation. The product innovation was a 25% already last year. This is a very good number, and we believe it\u2019s an efficient number. Now, it can be 25% or 30%, depending by quarter. But that\u2019s, anyway, very powerful innovation. The thing that we have improved also the rhythm of innovation. We have innovation really gradually per category, per quarter, per brand in a very sophistic way, market-by-market to make sure that we can leverage it. And the innovation is strongly supported by sufficient media. And our advertising in total is increasing in fiscal year 2022 in absolute level. And that\u2019s a list in the current assumptions guidance. And these advertising \u2013 some part of it is guiding the innovation and the innovation results. But also, a lot of our innovation is attracting earned media value in a fantastic way. A good example of this has been MACStack\u2019s in the last fiscal year. So, it\u2019s not only paid media, but it\u2019s also earned media that is attached to high-quality innovation. And so, some of the high-quality innovation is also efficient from the spending standpoint, from a media standpoint for that reason and then finally, innovation is driving pricing because innovation many times is about improving product, improving product performance or entering benefit areas that are more important for the consumer that\u2019s willing to pay more. And so we can invest in our standing products that deliver these results and price for these results as well. So, it\u2019s a combination of factor why innovation is and will continue to be a very strong driver. And if you assume more or less the same percentage of innovation on a growing business, so innovation in absolute \u2013 will also increase year-after-year in absolute level. On distribution, we have opportunities still to increase distribution. And we are doing it particularly online where there are a lot of new online ways to access consumer in efficient and productive way. It\u2019s also important to understand that the distribution opportunity at the end is about consumer coverage. It\u2019s about covering consumers that have desire today that are not covered. The best example of this is, for example, in emerging markets, starting from China, as an example, where we are covering 148 cities, but demand come from 600 cities or more, and we serve the cities where there is no physical distribution value online. This is happening the same in India. It\u2019s happening in Brazil. It\u2019s happening in Mexico. It\u2019s happening in many of the emerging markets. So, the new distribution online is covering new consumer in the large majority of cases, and it\u2019s very efficient. There is a lot of opportunity. There is some, which are already in this fiscal year, the fiscal year 2023 assumption. And there are many in the medium to long-term that we are studying and prepared to do.\nOperator: The next question is from Olivia Tong of Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nOlivia Tong: Great. Thanks. I wanted to ask you a little bit more about the price increases that you are planning, realizing, of course, it\u2019s not clearly the same as CPG. But by tier, sort of super luxury, beauty prestige, how your prices will compare to your peers, especially given that more and more sales are happening in multichannel or online where you will be closer to other brands or consumers can see multiple brands on one screen? And then if I could just sneak in another question sort of piggybacking on Bryan\u2019s about the distribution, the targeted expansion of distribution to retailers that provide broader consumer reach. Fairly certain, I know what isn\u2019t included, but if you could talk a little bit about what that might entail globally and how that \u2013 the channel mix progresses as a result? Thank you.\nTracey Travis: Yes. So, I will start, Olivia, on the pricing piece. We have a very sophisticated algorithm for pricing. So, we do look at price and by SKU, actually, by brand, by SKU relative to what the brand has defined as the competitive set for that particular SKU when we consider what pricing we are going to take, for instance, on, whether it\u2019s on a pricing increase on an existing product or even when we introduce a new product. So, that\u2019s very much taken into consideration. We also, depending on \u2013 because we have a very broad price tier, obviously, of our products from Lamar and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle and Tom Ford to Clinique and MAC and The Ordinary. We also look at for our entry-level prestige brands the gap to their comparable closest mass brand. And so we are also cognizant of that. That has served us quite well in those multi-specialty accounts that you are referring to where our goal continues to be trading consumers up from mass to prestige. And that has worked quite well for us in those particular accounts. And then you had a follow-up question on distribution, I think.\nOlivia Tong: That\u2019s right. Just understanding when you say you are expanding your distribution to provide a broader consumer reach, what \u2013 I think we all know what that does not entail, but what that does entail globally and what that \u2013 what the implications might be both for sales and profit?\nFabrizio Freda: Frankly, it\u2019s what I was explaining in the answer to the previous question. And there are \u2013 for example, if you go online in a new partner, with a new partner online, with a new distribution, we cover cities and we cover areas, which are not covered by brick-and-mortar. So, these reach consumers that were not reached before. And that\u2019s why expanded our reach. That\u2019s the key thing. So, in other words, doesn\u2019t \u2013 we try to avoid duplication in distribution as much as possible and maximize consumer coverage. And the key strong benefit that we are getting, as I said, particularly in emerging markets, but that\u2019s true everywhere in the world, is the fact that we are getting new consumers into our business and sourcing new consumers from us into prestige. Tracey?\nTracey Travis: Yes. And Olivia, so we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are introducing Aveda into China. That\u2019s expanding distribution for the brand. So, one way we expand distribution is introducing products into a new market, as Fabrizio was indicating, other emerging markets. We introduced The Ordinary into India via NYKAA. So, that\u2019s one way that we expand distribution, particularly in a market where consumers had not had that opportunity to purchase that product before unless they traveled. We also expand with our existing retailers. So, here in North America, as Ulta and Sephora opened new doors or any other retailer opens new doors, it is our consideration without being over retailed from a brick-and-mortar standpoint of expanding in those stores as well. And that\u2019s an expanded \u2013 expansion in terms of distribution. So, if our retailer opens 20 new doors this year, we will open those doors with them. And so we include that in our distribution. I think I said in my prepared remarks that we expect around 2 points of growth this year from distribution. And largely, it\u2019s those types of distribution. Fabrizio talked as well about pure plays. Pure plays have been a fantastic way for us to actually \u2013 selective pure plays. We are very selective to actually reach new consumers, in particular, younger consumers and \u2013 who are shopping more online and maybe shopping on an apparel site online that we have an opportunity to introduce beauty products to and get a new consumer as well as a new shopping occasion as they are shopping for their apparel products. So, it\u2019s a very thoughtful way that we think about distribution and expanding distribution right now really to focus on reaching new consumers.\nOperator: We have time for one more question from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you for squeezing me in and good morning everyone. So, my question is on the cadence of the quarter of the year guidance within the quarter. The sell side consumers are more cautious to travel, you mentioned retail inventory, if I am mistaken. I wonder if you are embedding some adjustment to retained employees in Q1? And if so, the magnitude of that impact that would give us more confidence on the recovery for the remaining nine months. And just a clarification on how much you expect sales to decline in China, including Hainan, in Q1, embedded in your guidance? Thank you.\nTracey Travis: Yes. So, I will start with the last, Andrea. We don\u2019t give specific market information. So, it\u2019s embedded in our guidance. You can certainly \u2013 if you think about what we have said previously in terms of the size of those businesses, you can probably back into a little bit in terms of what that impact would be. In terms of the retail inventory situation, we do expect that to improve in the second quarter. That was very specific to the U.S., actually, the Americas, but specific to the U.S. And we do expect that to improve in the second quarter as the holiday season approaches. And we do ship those holiday sets in Q2 that we shipped last year in Q1.\nFabrizio Freda: I think the other part of the question was Hainan. And in Hainan in this moment, they are not ordering. So, there is no inventory sold, but they are \u2013 still, what they are selling, they are selling from existing inventory. So, there is \u2013 there will be the possibility in the future to rebuild and normalize inventories when COVID abates.\nTracey Travis: And the only other thing I would add and you didn\u2019t ask about this, but currency. So, as you saw in our guidance, currency is a big impact for us this year. Obviously, if currency rates change, that will improve. But right now, if currency rates remain where they are at, and hopefully won\u2019t get worse, then about 70% of the impact of currency \u2013 the year-over-year impact of the currency depreciation that we have experienced is in the first half. So, that should moderate. We really saw the currency depreciation beginning in the currencies that I mentioned that are the most impactful to us in the second half of our year, really starting in the March, April timeframe. So, we will be anniversarying that in the second half. So, again, as I mentioned, it\u2019s a bit of a tale of two halves and given some of the macro things that are impacting us in this fiscal year.\nOperator: That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session.

            "name": "Fabrizio Freda",
            "content": "Thank you, Rainey and hello to everyone. I am grateful to be with you today to reflect on our record results for fiscal year 2022 and discuss the drivers of our outlook for fiscal year 2023. We leveraged our strengths amid the prolonged pandemic, the invasion of Ukraine and the onset of higher inflation. Our multiple NGO growth strategy, flexible financial model and exceptional talent enabled us to deliver record performance. At the same time, we invested for long-term growth, reflecting our confidence in the vibrancy of prestige beauty now and in the future. We achieved better-than-expected results in our fourth quarter, leading to above guidance organic sales growth of 8% for fiscal year 2022. Reported sales rose 9% despite heightened foreign exchange pressure to end the year. Adjusted operating margin expanded 80 basis points to an all-time high of 19.7%. We realized this greater profitability even as our growth engines diversified beyond our highest margins categories. Fragrance, makeup and hair care delivered double-digit sales growth on a reported basis to complement our robust skin care business. Impressively, 9 brands contributed double-digit organic sales growth for the year despite the significant pressure from COVID-19 in Asia-Pacific in the fourth quarter. La Mer, Jo Malone London and Le Labo showcased the strength of our portfolio across our large, scaling and developing brands respectively. M\u00b7A\u00b7C, Este\u0301e Lauder and Clinique powered makeup emerging renaissance, with double-digit gains in the category as Jon Malone London and Tom Ford Beauty elevated fragrance to new heights with striking growth. Our geographic diversity has been a distinct benefit during the pandemic allowing us to create and capture growth where opportunities presented themselves around the world. Asia-Pacific led growth in fiscal \u201820 and \u201821 as markets in the West were more negatively impacted by COVID-19, while the Americas and EMEA drove growth in 2022 as the East confronted renewed pressure from the virus. Today, our $17.7 billion in annual reported revenues tops pre-pandemic levels by 19% fueled by organic sales growth and enhanced by our acquisitions of Dr. Jart and DECIEM. Adjusted operating margin expanded 220 basis points over the 3 years. Our trusted brands with the hero products and sought-after innovation have thrived, while our increasingly flexible cost structure has served us well. Our focus on hero product has been a winning strategy. These high repeat loyalty-inducing products have grown significantly as a mix of our business since fiscal year 2019. Throughout, we have continued to innovate to propel our hero strategy for the years ahead. Innovation served as a powerful catalyst for growth this year, representing over 25% of sales once again. Our newness exceeded consumer desires due to our exceptional data analytics, R&D and creative capabilities. La Mer's Hydrating Infusion Emulsion, Este\u0301e Lauder [indiscernible] Serum and Macstack Mascara are among our breakthrough launches this year, driving favorable earned media value and strong new consumer acquisition. Turning to category performance. Fragrance grew a stunning 32% organically for the year. Jo Malone London, Tom Ford Beauty, Le Labo, KILIAN PARIS and Editions de Parfums Fre\u0301de\u0301ric Malle, each rose strong double-digit and expanded in every region, including excellent results in travel retail in EMEA. Este\u0301e Lauder brand launched the luxury collection and airing contributed double-digit gains. The outstanding performance of our luxury and artisanal portfolio affirms our strategic pivot to this portfolio affirms our strategic pivot to this accretive segment of the category. Consumers' behaviors during the pandemic reinforced fragrance as part of self-care and solidified online as the destination for the category to explore, learn and purchase. Our brands stepped up to create and leverage these new dynamics. We capitalize on the recovery in brick-and-mortar in many markets realizing high levels of engagement in freestanding stores, while online continue to prosper for the category. Makeup remitted a powerful growth engine in fiscal year 2022. Strong double-digit organic sales gains in the Americas and EMEA more than offset a double-digit decline in Asia-Pacific. As markets in the west reopened, leading to more social and professional use educations, the makeup renaissance emerged. Our brand excelled with innovative artists as well as new products, which focused on performance, ingredient narratives and skinifications of makeup. We leveraged increased traffic in brick-and-mortar, which allowed us to reestablish our well-loved services in store to resonate the recent growth in services. Hair care proved to be a valuable growth engine, contributing double-digit organic sales growth. The unique value proposition and go-to-market strategy for each of Aveda and Bumble and bumble resonated with consumers who increasingly expect the benefits of quality products and performance-based ingredients. The skin care category was the most impacted from the resurgence of COVID-19 in Asia-Pacific in the second half of the fiscal year as restriction reduced traffic in brick-and-mortar as well as travel retail and also temporarily curtailed our distribution capacity in Mainland China. In this context, we delivered solid results as excellent performance from La Mer, Clinique, Bobbi Brown offset pressure from other brands. La Mer had a remarkable year. Consumers around the world gravitated to its icon and robust innovations, embracing newness like the Hydrating Infused Emulsion and the upgrade to The Treatment Lotion to expand their regiments. Genaissance de la Mer lifted sales further as consumers traded up to the brand Ulta luxury franchise for its artisanal quality and parallel efficacy and high-curated experiences. Clinique and Bobbi Brown success in skin care demonstrated the execution of our sophisticated hero strategy to drive strong repeat and consumer loyalty. Clinique heroes across categories from makeup remover to serum to moisturizer provided it with a winning formula while Bobbi Brown's global and regional hero philosophy is driving its mix of business in skin care much higher. Looking now at channels. Both brick-and-mortar and online served as growth engines for the year as we pushed exciting initiatives to amplify our omnichannel capability. Let me share a few of the highlights. Brick-and-mortar rebounded strongly in the America and EMEA as specialty multi freestanding stores and department store all contributed. Our Post-COVID Business Acceleration Program enabled us to improve the productivity and sustainability of our brand building, experiential brick-and-mortar footprint as intended. Online grew mid single-digits organically led by double-digit growth in Asia-Pacific. DECIEM high online penetration boosted reported sales growth in the channel to double-digits. Our online channel encompassing brand.com, third-party platforms, pure-play retailers and retail.com is now far more than twice as big pre-pandemic fiscal \u201819. China and the U.S., which already high online penetration, have expanded further, while markets in EMEA have seen a surge in online penetration that are now able to realize the benefits of scale. During the year, we diversified in high-growth channels globally to expand our consumer reach. Este\u0301e Lauder, Clinique and Origins initially launched on JD in China. And given the insights gained as well as new consumer acquisition trends, we introduced more brands on JD. Jo Malone London and La Mer launched on Lazada in Southeast Asia and many brands participated in the emerging Ulta Beauty at Target and Sephora calls partnership in the U.S., both in store and online. We continue to innovate across the online ecosystem to generate trial and repeat. In Latin America, which has historically been a strong market for direct selling, we leverage WhatsApp and drove social selling to represent 30% of online sales in the region. Around the world, our beauty advisers and makeup artists became content creators for always-on creation across social media platforms like TikTok. This showcases the powerful evolution of the reach and scale of our expert advice, which now stands well beyond brick-and-mortar. We also advanced our omnichannel strategy meaningfully this year. In North America, most of our freestanding stores are now equipped with fulfillment capability. We also began to stand up these features in EMEA and Asia-Pacific. These new capabilities are driving higher average order values and convincing up-sell trends. At the same time, we extended the reach of our loyalty programs globally, introducing programs in Japan, Italy and Mexico and expanding offering in other markets across EMEA and Asia-Pacific. Here too, the results are compelling. We are realizing greater purchase frequency, higher level of retention from consumer engaged in loyalty programs. During the fiscal year, we also progressed our ESG goals and commitments. We continue to make strides on our climate action strategy, including the expansion of our renewable energy portfolio across our direct operations globally and we are recognized by a leading NGO for our commitment to source 100% renewable electricity. In packaging, we set a more ambitious goal to increase the post-consumer recycled content of our packaging to 25% or more by the end of 2025 and set a new goal to reduce the amount of virgin petroleum packaging to 50% or less by the end of 2030. We expanded employee resource groups, a great source of community and unity. Our network of Black leaders and executives launched in Brazil, while we welcome [ph] our group of LGBTQIA+ employees launched in EMEA. We created a group for our ageless employees and continue to scale our reverse mentoring program globally, pairing more junior talent with senior leaders to share insight and perspectives on trends to drive better business decision and faster career development. We brought our unique signature women leadership program, open doors to our international markets with continued great success in promoting our next generation of women leaders. We realized important progress with the [indiscernible] leadership development program. Its inaugural class has already achieved high level of career mobility in the forms of promotions and new roles for Black employees. We are encouraged by these initial results and look forward to continued success from this sponsorship program, which we created for equitable advancement and professional development of our Black talent. Before I talk about the year ahead, let me conclude on fiscal year 2022 by speaking about DECIEM, which complemented our organic sales growth. The ordinary DECIEM's ingredient-based brand diversified in exciting ways over the last few months. The brand launched in India and Malaysia, expanded its hair care offering and also introduced Multi-Peptide Lash & Brow Serum to extend its authorities in treatment. From its innovation exceeding expectation to outstanding initial results in Nike in India, the ordinary entered fiscal year 2023 with promising opportunities. Now for the future, we refreshed our 10-year's Compass to help steer our ambitions and investment for the next decade. The Compass reinforced our confidence showcasing the abundant growth opportunities ahead. The drivers are many led by growing middle class globally and most especially in emerging markets, expanding usage across consumer segment, including ageless and men and online expansion, fostering consumer access and reach. From the Compass, we distilled our 3-year strategy. As we look across the next 3 years, we expect to deliver more balanced growth across categories and regions. Near-term, the pandemic and macro factors will likely lead to more valuable growth by category and regions. We are very confident in the strength of our company and in the vibrancy of prestige beauty. For fiscal year 2023, we expect to deliver strong organic sales growth fueled by our diversified growth engines and enticing innovation and to take the opportunity in a volatile year to continue investing for our exciting future to build global share. While the external challenges are many, including inflation, geopolitical uncertainty and currency headwinds, the enduring desirability of our brands with their hero products at high repeat rates is powerful. Additionally, our more effective cost structure, pricing power and strong cash generation should afford us the flexibility to successfully navigate the ongoing complex environment. Innovation is poised to be a catalyst for growth and we began the year with exciting news. Let me share insights about two skin care launches. Este\u0301e Lauder upgraded Advanced Night Repair Eye Supercharged gel cream, addresses the signs of eye agings and reflects consumer modern lifestyles of launch screen times and environmental stressors. Offering notable incremental benefits from the original product, this launch demonstrates the pricing power of innovation. Clinique Smart Clinical Repair line extended its fiscal 2022 innovation streak with the launch of Smart Clinical Repair Wrinkle Correcting Cream. The moisturizer is coupled with the powerful new claims for Smart Clinical Repair Serum to drive gains in this hero franchise. This year, we expect to reignite growth engines in Asia-Pacific as the pressure of COVID-19 abates. We anticipate in-store traffic levels to gradually improve in Mainland China, allowing brick-and-mortar to return to growth to complement ongoing strength online and for tourism trends to Hainan to ultimately accelerate from the most recent post, which began last week. We are confident in the long-term growth opportunity in Mainland China, evidenced by our expansion into almost 100 new doors and 3 additional cities in fiscal year 2022 as well as our introduction of Aveda last month. We are thrilled to enter the hair care category with Aveda, which is vegan and Leaping Bunny approved as the brand launched on Tmall and opened its first freestanding store in the market. Fiscal 2023 is set to be a monumental year for us as of our Shanghai innovation lab opens, advancing our ambition to best creates for the Chinese consumers and we begin limited production in our new manufacturing facility near Tokyo, which is our first ever in Asia-Pacific. With these two strategic initiatives, we expect to benefit over the next few years from increased speed-to-market and by further expanding our momentum with outstanding locally relevant innovation in this vibrant region. For the Americas and EMEA, we anticipate ongoing strength from our growth engines across categories and channels as well as across developed and emerging markets given the broad-based gains of fiscal year 2022. For makeup, which is a vital category in both regions, the emergence of the makeup renaissance, give us great confidence going into fiscal year 2023. In North America, and particularly, our focus turns to granular consumer growth opportunity as we have refined our distribution. To close, we delivered excellent performance in fiscal year 2022, achieving record results while advancing initiatives for consumer acquisition, engagement and high-touch services and experiences to drive trial and repeat levels even higher. Today, our business is not only far bigger and more profitable than the pre-pandemic fiscal year 2019, but our growth drivers are more diversified. Our R&D and innovation capabilities are more robust and our cost structure is more flexible. While the year ahead more certainly has its external challenges, our company is poised for a bright future as the best diversified pure player in prestige beauty with the most talented and passionate employees to whom I extend my deepest gratitude. I will now turn the call over to Tracey. Good morning, Dara. And I'll comment on market share. As Tracey just said, we do expect for the full year, China to go back growing double digit. We expect strong recovery in Hainan in the second part, in the second semester of the fiscal year, for sure, a gradual recovery before. That's our assumption, which obviously is going to give us also results in market share. So speaking about the last \u2013 the quarter four, to be clear, the market in China was down 10%. Este\u0301e Lauder Company was down 13%. So we lost 1 point of market share. We are now at 23%, so very strong market share. I would like to argue that given the lockdown of our distribution center, the impossibility of serving for almost 2 months, our consumers losing 1 point of market share temporarily is actually showing that already in June, we started recovery with an outstanding 6/18 event and the management of this. And then to speak about what we are going to do further in the next 6 months to recover the market share we lost because of the distribution down, first of all, strong brand portfolio brands. We are going to reinforce it with the launch of Aveda that just started, which is a very important launch entering the hair care, big and growing category, the luxury hair care, big and growing category in China. We are going to double down on Tmall and entering new successful online distribution that we started with JD, where we still have opportunity of deploying more brands in other areas where we are testing or distributing. We have very strong innovation starting with what we discussed in the remarks, which is the Este\u0301e Lauder Advanced Repair eye product, which eye is one of the most important categories in China, and to be clear, it's one of the most important recruitment strategies is eye products in the market. As you know, we are opening an R&D center this year. And so we are investing at even stronger innovations in the future. We are getting a great strategy to win in key shopping moments. I think that we had demonstrated in ATC in June for the 18/6 event is extraordinary. Our team, we are coming out of 40 days down in Shanghai, and they were able to operate successfully a very complex and important event. We are going to do the same with 11 November, hopefully, now in the second quarter. We are also improving our distribution in brick-and-mortar. We are opening new cities and new doors in the existing fast-growing cities. We have a new distribution center that we have opened. Actually, we opened this Friday in Guangzhou to mitigate risk of future distribution disruptions, and then this will turn into a definite ongoing new second big distribution center in the beginning of 2023. We believe the Hainan, despite the current lockdown, which is obviously painful in the short-term, but is a super strong opportunity for the long-term. The power of Hainan in the future remains intact and we have strong presence and market share in this operation. And I want to say we have an amazing local team, and this local team, they have been able to manage through these difficulties extremely well, and we believe that strength on which we can count in the future to continue building market share over time. Thank you for the question. Yes. Hi, Nik. No, actually, we don't feel this. It's probably the prestige cosmetic luxury cosmetic segment is more protected because of the big passion of consumers for this category. And as you know, the clear preference for the preference for the Chinese consumer for the prestige solutions, which is growing very fast for years now. And the percentage of prestige for the total market keeps improving. So, we don't see this. The proof I can give you is that the top of the ranges are growing the fastest also on our brand. La Mer is one of our fastest-growing brands as an example. So, the \u2013 and importantly, the market is very active when there are no restrictions, when there is no issues. So, we don't see any impact \u2013 obviously, we are prudent in the assumptions we are making on the China economy development in the short-term as everyone is. But we don't see a very big impact on our business in absence of COVID restrictions situations. Yes. I just want to add that the makeup will continue to follow the user education on makeup, so the normalization from a consumer standpoint. This is happening, but it's not yet up to the levels it used to be. So, it's going there and will be there. So, a lot of benefits are still in front of us and not behind us. So, we will see further progress over time, particularly in the East where the COVID lockdowns are still creating issues, not only in distribution, but also in consumer usage of makeup. The other important thing is that makeup is really a blend [ph] is linked to services. And so to have the proper experience, you need critical mass per store. And the critical mass per store is dependent on traffic, as Tracey said. So, this is also getting better. The renaissance is if you want at the beginning. So, more progress is in front of us. And that progress in particularly would also impact positively the bottom line and the profitability of the category. So, we are in the right direction, and we are not yet done on this. Yes. I will start on the product innovation. The product innovation was a 25% already last year. This is a very good number, and we believe it's an efficient number. Now, it can be 25% or 30%, depending by quarter. But that's, anyway, very powerful innovation. The thing that we have improved also the rhythm of innovation. We have innovation really gradually per category, per quarter, per brand in a very sophistic way, market-by-market to make sure that we can leverage it. And the innovation is strongly supported by sufficient media. And our advertising in total is increasing in fiscal year 2022 in absolute level. And that's a list in the current assumptions guidance. And these advertising \u2013 some part of it is guiding the innovation and the innovation results. But also, a lot of our innovation is attracting earned media value in a fantastic way. A good example of this has been MACStack's in the last fiscal year. So, it's not only paid media, but it's also earned media that is attached to high-quality innovation. And so, some of the high-quality innovation is also efficient from the spending standpoint, from a media standpoint for that reason and then finally, innovation is driving pricing because innovation many times is about improving product, improving product performance or entering benefit areas that are more important for the consumer that's willing to pay more. And so we can invest in our standing products that deliver these results and price for these results as well. So, it's a combination of factor why innovation is and will continue to be a very strong driver. And if you assume more or less the same percentage of innovation on a growing business, so innovation in absolute \u2013 will also increase year-after-year in absolute level. On distribution, we have opportunities still to increase distribution. And we are doing it particularly online where there are a lot of new online ways to access consumer in efficient and productive way. It's also important to understand that the distribution opportunity at the end is about consumer coverage. It's about covering consumers that have desire today that are not covered. The best example of this is, for example, in emerging markets, starting from China, as an example, where we are covering 148 cities, but demand come from 600 cities or more, and we serve the cities where there is no physical distribution value online. This is happening the same in India. It's happening in Brazil. It's happening in Mexico. It's happening in many of the emerging markets. So, the new distribution online is covering new consumer in the large majority of cases, and it's very efficient. There is a lot of opportunity. There is some, which are already in this fiscal year, the fiscal year 2023 assumption. And there are many in the medium to long-term that we are studying and prepared to do. Frankly, it's what I was explaining in the answer to the previous question. And there are \u2013 for example, if you go online in a new partner, with a new partner online, with a new distribution, we cover cities and we cover areas, which are not covered by brick-and-mortar. So, these reach consumers that were not reached before. And that's why expanded our reach. That's the key thing. So, in other words, doesn't \u2013 we try to avoid duplication in distribution as much as possible and maximize consumer coverage. And the key strong benefit that we are getting, as I said, particularly in emerging markets, but that's true everywhere in the world, is the fact that we are getting new consumers into our business and sourcing new consumers from us into prestige. Tracey? I think the other part of the question was Hainan. And in Hainan in this moment, they are not ordering. So, there is no inventory sold, but they are \u2013 still, what they are selling, they are selling from existing inventory. So, there is \u2013 there will be the possibility in the future to rebuild and normalize inventories when COVID abates."

            "name": "Tracey Travis",
            "content": "Thank you, Fabrizio and hello everyone. I will briefly cover the fiscal 2022 fourth quarter and full year results, followed by our thoughts on the outlook for fiscal 2023. Our fourth quarter organic net sales fell 8%, a bit better than we expected, reflecting the disruptions in China related to COVID restrictions, including travel retail in Hainan as well as the suspension of our commercial business in Russia and Ukraine. These matters more than offset continued growth from the recovery in the Americas and the rest of the EMEA region. Reported sales growth included approximately 1 percentage point from the addition of sales from DECIEM, while currency translation negatively impacted growth by approximately 3 percentage points. From a regional perspective, net sales in the Americas rose 9% organically led by double-digit increases in makeup and fragrance. Consumers continued their return to brick-and-mortar, leading to strong growth in freestanding retail and specialty multi-stores. We grew sales in nearly every market in the region, with particular strength in Canada and across Latin America. Net sales in our Europe, the Middle East and Africa region decreased 9% organically driven almost entirely by the disruptions in travel retail in China and the suspension of business in Russia and Ukraine. Of the remaining markets in the region, 10 rose double-digit as tourists returned to the region and consumer traffic and brick-and-mortar retail thrived. The makeup, fragrance and hair care categories rose strong double-digits in EMEA, while the decline in skin care reflected the soft travel retail sales in Asia. Global travel retail, which is primarily reported in this region, declined in Asia due to the COVID restrictions in China. Hainan, in particular, was impacted as stores were closed a portion of the quarter, travel was curtailed to the island and courier services for online deliveries were disrupted. However, travel retail in European markets and in the Americas rose triple-digits as airport traffic returned and doors in the channel reopened. Net sales in the Asia-Pacific region fell 19% organically. Greater China and Korea net sales were the most impacted by the COVID restrictions. Hardest hit was Shanghai, where the city-wide lockdown lasted 2 months, impacting our distribution capacity serving all of China through the end of May. Overall, our brands performed well for the important 6/18 holiday festival and maintained top rankings across the beauty space on both Tmall and JD. Elsewhere in Asia, there were some other bright spots. Malaysia, Japan, the Philippines and Vietnam continued to recover and have begun to reopen to tourism. Looking now at net sales by product category, fragrance led organic growth, with net sales rising 22% versus prior year. The fragrance category grew double-digits across all regions. Luxury fragrances continue to resonate with consumers looking for indulgence and our brands, including Tom Ford Beauty, Jo Malone London and La Labo were once again star performers. Net sales in makeup rose 8% organically driven by the continued recovery and increased usage occasions in Western markets, where makeup is generally the largest category. M\u00b7A\u00b7C and Clinique were top brand performers driven by hero products like MAC Studio Fix and the newly launched Macstack Mascara as well as Clinique's Almost Lipstick in Black Honey. Continued success and expansion in specialty multi-doors is also aiding category growth. Hair care net sales grew 5% organically. Excellent performance from Bumble and bumble in specialty multi contributed to growth. The launch of Aveda's vegan hair color in EMEA and a successful activation around the brand's hero and body franchise in Korea also aided category growth. Net sales in skin care were the most impacted by the COVID-related restrictions in China, affecting Greater China, Asian travel retail and Korea. Skin care continues to represent approximately two-thirds of our business in the Asia Pacific region. Net sales fell 21% in the quarter due to the disruption of the Shanghai distribution center, with the greatest impact felt by Este\u0301e Lauder and La Mer brands. Skin care growth benefited from the addition of DECIEM sales in the quarter by approximately 3 percentage points. Our gross margin declined 370 basis points compared to the fourth quarter last year driven primarily by factors affecting our supply chain. Global transportation delays, port congestion, labor and container shortages and higher costs for both ocean and air transport have increasingly pressured our cost of goods. Unfavorable category mix from softer skin care sales also contributed to the decline. Operating expenses decreased 9% driven by the curtailment of spending this quarter as COVID restrictions sharply reduced store traffic in China, including Hainan. We delivered operating income of $207 million for the quarter compared to $385 million in the prior year quarter. Diluted earnings per share of $0.42 included $0.03 dilution from the acquisition of DECIEM. Shifting now to our full year results. Giving the volatility experienced throughout the year, the results reflect the benefit derived from the diversification of our top line growth as well as the incredible agility of our teams and their ability to effectively manage costs while also simultaneously investing selectively for future growth. Net sales rose 8% organically, with double-digit gains in three out of four product categories and two out of three regions. Sales of our products online continued to thrive even as brick-and-mortar recovered, rising 11% for the year and representing 28% of sales. Among brick-and-mortar retail, most channels grew double digit, while department stores ended the year down slightly as pressure from COVID restrictions in Asia offset growth in other regions. And our business in travel retail also grew, ending fiscal 2022 at 27% of sales. Our gross margin fell 60 basis points to 75.8%. Favorable pricing and currency were more than offset by higher supply chain costs, which were more pronounced in the back half of the year, the impact of the acquisition of DECIEM and higher costs for new products and sets. Operating expenses declined 150 basis points to 56% of sales. Disciplined expense management and general and administrative costs was the largest contributor to the decline. The changes in our channel mix continue to reduce selling costs. And additionally, we continue to drive more effective resource allocation in our advertising and promotional mix. These favorable trends were partially offset by increased shipping costs. During the year, we continue to create more flexibility in our cost structure to absorb inflation in wages, media and logistics. We achieved significant savings from our cost initiatives, including the post-COVID business acceleration program. This has enabled us to realize great expense leverage while also reinvesting in areas that support profitable growth, resulting in an overall improvement in our operating margin. Our full year operating margin was 19.7%, representing an 80 basis point improvement over last year. This improvement includes the absorption of 60 basis points of dilution from DECIEM. Our effective tax rate for the year was 21.3%, a 260 basis point increase over the prior year, primarily driven by a lower current year tax benefit associated with share-based compensation and the prior year favorable impact of the U.S. government issuance of final GILTI tax regulations that provided for a retroactive high-tax exception. Net earnings rose 11% to $2.6 billion, and diluted EPS increased 12% to $7.24. Earnings per share includes $0.04 accretion from currency translation and $0.05 dilution from the acquisition of DECIEM. The Post-COVID Business Acceleration Program is wrapping up, with final estimated restructuring charges of $500 million to $515 million at the top end of our original projections. We are pleased with the progress we achieved from this program. We realigned our brand portfolio by exiting four designer fragrance brands as well as the BECCA and [indiscernible] brands, and we are streamlining our market distribution for Smashbox and GLAMGLOW to improve their long-term viability. We optimized our brick-and-mortar distribution network. We have been and will continue to close underproductive freestanding retail stores as we rebalance our distribution network. By the end of fiscal 2023, we expect to have closed nearly 250 freestanding retail stores under the program. We've also rationalized department store counters and other retail locations, improving our ability to focus our efforts on driving more profitable omni-channel opportunities in our remaining distribution. We also approved initiatives to optimize our organization across regions and throughout global functions to reduce complexity, leverage our scale and enhance our go-to-market capabilities. When we are finished executing the program, we expect a net reduction of between 2,500 and 3,000 positions globally. We expect to execute the remaining projects to achieve estimated annualized gross savings of between $390 million and $410 million before taxes beginning in fiscal 2024. A portion of these savings have been and will continue to be reinvested in capabilities that sustain our long-term growth, including data analytics, online and advertising. Turning now to our cash flow. We generated $3 billion in cash from operations, a 16% decrease from the $3.6 billion in the prior year period. The primary driver was higher working capital due to the end of year disruptions related to the pandemic the past few years as well as inventory to support future growth and to help mitigate the supply chain challenges we have faced in certain raw material and componentry areas. We utilized $1 billion for capital improvements, an increase of approximately $400 million over last year. We continue to invest in capacity and other supply chain improvements. We increased consumer-facing investments to support in-store experiences and recovery markets. We renovated office space, and we continue to invest in information technology. We also returned cash to stockholders at an accelerated pace this year as the need for more stringent cash conservation subsided with the progression of the recovery. During the year, we repurchased 7.4 million shares for $2.3 billion, and we paid $840 million in dividends, reflecting the 13% increase in our dividend rate that became effective in our fiscal second quarter. All in all, we delivered a strong year despite significant disruptions, including continued outbreaks of COVID, higher inflation, supply chain constraints and the invasion in Ukraine. And we also continue to invest in foundational capabilities for the future, including new production capacity and innovation to support growth. Now looking ahead to fiscal 2023, we believe that the prestige beauty category has ample opportunities for continued strong growth. Global prestige beauty is expected to grow mid to high single-digits driven by the continued recovery and the gradual reopening of the remaining market impacted by COVID restrictions. Additionally, we look forward to the continued resumption of international travel, especially in Hainan and the rest of Asia. We are concerned, however, that the recovery this fiscal year will once again not be a smooth one. Record inflation and the threat of recession or slowdown in many markets could temporarily dampen consumer enthusiasm and is causing some retailers to be more cautious regarding inventories. The strengthening dollar is putting pressure on our international earnings. Additionally, heightened geopolitical tensions could prove to be disruptive. With that backdrop in mind, for the full fiscal year, organic net sales are forecasted to grow 7% to 9%. We discontinued four designer fragrance licenses at the end of fiscal 2022. These brands generated $250 million in sales in fiscal 2022. In fiscal \u201823, we will sell some remaining inventory to the new licensees, primarily in the first half. Sales from both years will be excluded from our organic growth figures. At current levels, currency is projected to be a significant drag on our reported results in fiscal \u201823 as the U.S. dollar strengthens against key currencies. Based on July 31 spot rates at 1.018 for the euro, 1.215 for the pound, 6.746 for the Chinese yuan and 13 03 for the Korean won, we expect currency translation to dilute reported sales growth for the full fiscal year by 3 percentage points as well as an additional 1 point due to the impacts of foreign currency transactions in key international travel retail markets. There are a few other items impacting our sales growth in fiscal 2023. Our list price increases are expected to add approximately 5.5 points of growth, helping to offset inflationary cost pressures. We take most of our pricing actions at the beginning of our fiscal year. New distribution, including new doors in existing markets, new markets for certain brands and expansion on new online platforms, could add another 2 points. Conversely, the loss of sales in Russia and Ukraine are expected to trim about 1 percentage point from sales growth. We plan to continue to drive margin expansion through operational efficiencies and cost savings while fueling additional advertising investment where appropriate.  Our full year effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 23%. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $7.39 and $7.54 before restructuring and other charges. This includes approximately $0.20 of dilution from currency translation. In constant currency, we expect EPS to rise by 5% to 7%. The impact from foreign currency transactions in key international travel retail markets is also expected to negatively impact adjusted diluted earnings per common share by \u2013 growth by 6 percentage points. At this time, we expect organic sales for our first quarter to fall 4% to 6%. The impact of sales from certain designer license exits are expected to dilute reported growth by approximately 1 point and currency is expected to be dilutive by approximately 3 points. Our first quarter sales are expected to be negatively impacted by continued COVID restrictions in China and Hainan. As you may recall, last year, we mentioned that some of our retailers in North America secured holiday shipments earlier due to supply chain concern, contributing 1.5 points to our growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. This year, retailers in the U.S. have been tightening their inventories, causing our net sales to trail retail sale. We expect China and travel retail in APAC to gradually improve throughout the first half of the fiscal year as COVID restrictions lift. And comparisons should ease in the back half of the year as we lap the invasion of Ukraine and the significant impact of COVID restrictions in China. We expect first quarter EPS of $1.22 to $1.32. Currency translation is expected to be dilutive to EPS by $0.04. The impact from foreign currency transactions in key international travel retail markets is expected to negatively impact adjusted diluted earnings per common share growth by 5 percentage points. In closing, we remain confident about the long-term prospects for global prestige beauty and in our strategy to outpace industry growth. Our multiple engines of growth delivered in fiscal 2022, and we anticipate this more diversified growth can continue in the coming year. And importantly, we continue to reinforce the fundamental drivers of our business that both enable and contribute to continued strong future sales and EPS growth. I would like to close by extending our heartfelt gratitude to our employees around the globe for continuing to deliver our results during this challenging macro environment. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will be happy to take your questions at this time. Good morning, Dara. So I'll start, Dara, regarding China and what we've baked into our assumptions. Clearly, the first quarter, we are seeing some intermittent disruptions. Our distribution center is open. We're actually \u2013 and opened in June, as we mentioned. So we were well prepared for the 6/18 holiday festival, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks. We are still seeing some intermittent shutdowns, not whole city shutdowns in China at the moment. So that is still disrupting brick-and-mortar retail. So we have factored that in, certainly to our Q1 expectations for the China market. As it relates to Hainan, as we mentioned also in our prepared remarks, and I'm sure you all have seen, Hainan is experiencing a lockdown right now. So, all of the doors are closed. Courier services as well have been suspended for online orders. And we're obviously monitoring that day by day, but that is something that began in the month \u2013 at the beginning of the month of August. And right now, we're expecting that to continue through the end of the month of August with some resumption in September, but not full resumption in September, recognizing that as this situation continues to impact the market, there will be some level of reticence for consumers to travel. But we certainly expect that, that will improve in the upcoming months. So I think first quarter and first half, we are expecting some level of muted performance in the region related to these issues. We do expect second quarter to be better than first quarter. And then in the second half, obviously, we're anniversarying quite a bit of disruption in the fourth quarter, some of which, again, in the third quarter for both Hainan as well as China. And we do expect that we will see strong growth in the second half. For the full year, we do expect China to grow double digit. And so again, we are \u2013 it is a market that we know there is very strong demand for prestige beauty and for our products and the same with Hainan as well. So we are just navigating through these first few months of the year until we get on the other side in the second half. Yes, Lauren. So I'll start. Good morning. We did call out, obviously, in our prepared remarks and in the press release a couple of adjustments in our revenue numbers this year. So we did exit our prestige designer licensed businesses. Basically, we ended those licenses. Our focus is on luxury fragrance and artisanal fragrance. And so we did let those licenses expire. That is about 1 point of growth. The other point is related to the suspension of our operations in Russia and Ukraine. And so that is also contributing another point, if you will, to adjusted growth and to the suppression of growth that you're referring to. And then lastly, the currency impact on revenue also impacts us in terms of our growth algorithm. So if you adjust for all of those items, it's about 6 points of difference between what we've guided for the full year and where we expect \u2013 where we would expect to end if none of those events had happened. So that is the reason why the growth looks a bit muted even with the 5.5% pricing. The other thing I would say again is we are starting the year with a fair amount of disruption as we just spoke about in some of our very important markets. And we are assuming a more gradual recovery, and that, too, impacts our unit growth. Yes. Obviously, we experienced some gross margin pressure in Q4. It was related to some of the activity that we had to manage through in terms of getting product to market and some of the disruption that's in general in the supply chain. So \u2013 and as we think about the first quarter and the guidance that we have provided, we do expect gross margins to be down as well in the first quarter, not to the same extent as they were in the fourth quarter, and that will gradually improve throughout the year as we are anniversarying some of those disruptions. So, for the full year, we are expecting gross margins to be around flat at the moment. But the first \u2013 it's a tale of two halves in terms of the first half and some of the things we are anniversarying and some of the pressures that we are seeing on the business. But we do expect for the full year gross margin to be flat. In terms of SG&A, again, we expect that we will continue to get good SG&A leverage. I think we are incredibly proud of what our team was able to deliver this past fiscal year and fiscal 2022 in terms of the expense leverage that we were able to deliver. And it's something that we are keenly focused on while also focused on investing in the important areas that drive our long-term growth algorithm. So, those are things that we continue to manage throughout the year, and we will get continued expense leverage this year. Yes. I think we have seen over the timeframe that you are speaking about. And yes, we definitely had accounting changes that impacted the gross margin between expenses and gross margin. But we have seen differences in the business in terms of our mix of business. And so fundamentally \u2013 and I know it's important to understand what's going on in gross margin, but really, what we focus on is operating margin. And as we have seen channel shifts and market shifts, etcetera, those have impacted the gross margin, perhaps in some cases \u2013 in some of those cases, more negatively, but they have impacted the operating margin quite positively. So, at the end of the day, we are focused on delivering operating margin and profitable growth. In terms of whether or not we expect that we will get back to higher levels of gross margin, it is something that we are working on with our supply chain. So, between our direct procurement programs, between some of the things we are doing in transportation, the opening of our Japanese plant, which should allow us to be not only closer to the consumer, but even to some of our suppliers for inbound freight should also help us from a gross margin standpoint. I am not going to commit that we are going to get back to the gross margins that we were at 5 years or 6 years ago, but do know that there are things that we see that are opportunities that we are also working on and very close partnership with our supply chain. Okay. So, let me \u2013 I will start. In terms of makeup, we continue to be quite bullish on the makeup category. We did see a recovery, particularly in our Western markets. So, part of the strength that we saw this year \u2013 this past fiscal year in terms of the growth in makeup and the improvement in margin that we saw in makeup was related to the recovery, in particular, in brick-and-mortar in our Western markets, so in the Americas as well as in Europe. We are still challenged a bit in makeup in our Eastern markets because of some of the disruption that's going on, in particular, in brick-and-mortar. And \u2013 but we expect makeup to gradually improve as the disruption in those markets improve, and similar to Western markets, as consumers resume their normal social and professional occasions. So, that is our expectation in terms of when we will get back to fiscal \u201819 levels for makeup, depending on the disruptions this year. It may take another year or so. But our makeup brands have fantastic innovation for this year, in particular, the MAC brand, but others as well. And so we are very encouraged in terms of makeup. As it relates to the margin, the makeup category has been particularly hit by the pandemic that is now going on for 3 years because of the brick-and-mortar distribution of makeup, and in particular, with a few of our makeup brands where services in-store are very well loved by our consumers and the in-store experience, that took \u2013 that was a bit of a challenge with doors closed and with traffic down. And traffic is still down in brick-and-mortar, even in the markets that are in recovery, traffic has not recovered to prior levels, but it's well on its way to do so. So, I think one of the reasons why we took some of the actions we did with the post-COVID business acceleration program is take a point of view to your point of what that will look like when things are stabilized and what the mix between brick-and-mortar and online should be and took proactive measures to close some underproductive doors, and largely, that will help the makeup category. Most \u2013 many of those stores were makeup doors. Some of them were Origins stores. Some of them were Bobbi doors, actually. So, that should continue to help the makeup category as volume returns to \u2013 in particular, brick-and-mortar. Yes. So, I will start, Olivia, on the pricing piece. We have a very sophisticated algorithm for pricing. So, we do look at price and by SKU, actually, by brand, by SKU relative to what the brand has defined as the competitive set for that particular SKU when we consider what pricing we are going to take, for instance, on, whether it's on a pricing increase on an existing product or even when we introduce a new product. So, that's very much taken into consideration. We also, depending on \u2013 because we have a very broad price tier, obviously, of our products from Lamar and Fre\u0301de\u0301ric Malle and Tom Ford to Clinique and MAC and The Ordinary. We also look at for our entry-level prestige brands the gap to their comparable closest mass brand. And so we are also cognizant of that. That has served us quite well in those multi-specialty accounts that you are referring to where our goal continues to be trading consumers up from mass to prestige. And that has worked quite well for us in those particular accounts. And then you had a follow-up question on distribution, I think. Yes. And Olivia, so we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are introducing Aveda into China. That's expanding distribution for the brand. So, one way we expand distribution is introducing products into a new market, as Fabrizio was indicating, other emerging markets. We introduced The Ordinary into India via NYKAA. So, that's one way that we expand distribution, particularly in a market where consumers had not had that opportunity to purchase that product before unless they traveled. We also expand with our existing retailers. So, here in North America, as Ulta and Sephora opened new doors or any other retailer opens new doors, it is our consideration without being over retailed from a brick-and-mortar standpoint of expanding in those stores as well. And that's an expanded \u2013 expansion in terms of distribution. So, if our retailer opens 20 new doors this year, we will open those doors with them. And so we include that in our distribution. I think I said in my prepared remarks that we expect around 2 points of growth this year from distribution. And largely, it's those types of distribution. Fabrizio talked as well about pure plays. Pure plays have been a fantastic way for us to actually \u2013 selective pure plays. We are very selective to actually reach new consumers, in particular, younger consumers and \u2013 who are shopping more online and maybe shopping on an apparel site online that we have an opportunity to introduce beauty products to and get a new consumer as well as a new shopping occasion as they are shopping for their apparel products. So, it's a very thoughtful way that we think about distribution and expanding distribution right now really to focus on reaching new consumers. Yes. So, I will start with the last, Andrea. We don't give specific market information. So, it's embedded in our guidance. You can certainly \u2013 if you think about what we have said previously in terms of the size of those businesses, you can probably back into a little bit in terms of what that impact would be. In terms of the retail inventory situation, we do expect that to improve in the second quarter. That was very specific to the U.S., actually, the Americas, but specific to the U.S. And we do expect that to improve in the second quarter as the holiday season approaches. And we do ship those holiday sets in Q2 that we shipped last year in Q1. And the only other thing I would add and you didn't ask about this, but currency. So, as you saw in our guidance, currency is a big impact for us this year. Obviously, if currency rates change, that will improve. But right now, if currency rates remain where they are at, and hopefully won't get worse, then about 70% of the impact of currency \u2013 the year-over-year impact of the currency depreciation that we have experienced is in the first half. So, that should moderate. We really saw the currency depreciation beginning in the currencies that I mentioned that are the most impactful to us in the second half of our year, really starting in the March, April timeframe. So, we will be anniversarying that in the second half. So, again, as I mentioned, it's a bit of a tale of two halves and given some of the macro things that are impacting us in this fiscal year."

For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Rainey Mancini.\nRainey Mancini: Hello. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges and adjustments disclosed in our press release. Unless otherwise stated, all net sales growth numbers are in constant currency, and all organic net sales growth excludes the noncomparable impacts of acquisitions, divestitures, brand closures and the impact of currency translation. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our press release and on the Investors section of our website. As a reminder, references to online sales include sales we make directly to our consumers through our brand.com sites and through third-party platforms. It also includes estimated sales of our products through our retailers' websites. [Operator Instructions] And now I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio.\nFabrizio Freda: Thank you, Rainey, and hello to everyone. I want to begin by expressing the great sadness where for our colleagues and all the people impacted by the envision of Ukraine, who are experiencing a devastating humanitarian crisis. We continue to focus on our employee safety, and our dearest hope is for peace to prevail. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, we delivered organic sales growth of 9%, in line with our guidance despite the acceleration of temporary COVID-19 restriction in China in March. We exercised cost discipline as volatility increased, and our adjusted operating margin expanded, leading to stronger-than-expected adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of 17%. Our multiple engines of growth strategy enabled us to amplify the engines of the moment amid intensified macro environment, with sales rising organically across both brick-and-mortar and online. Every category grew organically, led by fragrances' outstanding performance. 11 brands contributed double-digit organic sales growth and further demonstrated our diversified drivers. Consumer demand remains robust even in this inflationary environment. Our largest brands provided highly sought-after, M-A-C, Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique each delivered double-digit growth in makeup, fueling the category renaissance while La Mer thrived in skin care. Four of our scaling brands resonated strongly with consumers as Jo Malone London, Tom Ford Beauty, Aveda and Bobbi Brown each rose double digits. Among our developing brands, Le Labo, KILIAN PARIS and Bumble and bumble each achieved outsized growth and showcased their promise. Our sales rose double digit organically in the Americas and EMEA. We capitalize on reopening to translate improving brick-and-mortar traffic trends into outstanding sales growth, owing to our high-touch services, breakthrough innovation, hero franchises and operational excellence. Our freestanding stores delivered exceptional performance benefiting from fleet optimization and expanded omnichannel capabilities and complement the strengths in specialty multi. We are managing the ongoing complexities from the invasion of Ukraine as well as the temporary COVID-driven restrictions in China, which impacted performance in Asia-Pacific in the quarter. In Mainland China, organic sales fell mid-single-digit as 25% growth online was offset by a steep decline in brick-and-mortar. After a strong February, in Mainland China, traffic slowed more sharply in March to pressure brick-and-mortar sales. Additionally, for us, the distribution centers for our Mainland China business are in Shanghai and operated with limited capacity. Tourism to Hainan highland was also curtailed in March after a vibrant start of the quarter. There is no doubt that these current limitations in China will prove to be transitory, although there will be a far greater impact on our results in the fourth quarter than they were in the third quarter, as Tracy will discuss. Looking ahead, we are confident in the resilience of the Chinese consumers and the untapped opportunity driving our investments in the market. We expect a reacceleration of growth when this moment of COVID abates. Let me share the progress we made during the third quarter to drive these strong results and advance our long-term ambitions for our multiple engine of growth strategy. Innovation excelled to reach nearly 30% of sales. We continue to elevate our ability to leverage data analytics with our best-in-class creative talent and R&D to successfully anticipate scale and set trends. The breadth of our innovation wins was far-reaching and benefited every category in skincare, La Mer upgraded The Treatment Lotion sort as the brand doubled down on this coveted East-West product, increasing the skin recharging Miracle Broad and transitioning to a recyclable luxurious glass bottle that contains 20% post-consumer recycled content. In Asia-Pacific, consumer gravitated to the new serum strengths and anti-aging benefits, while in the Americas, educating on the benefits of hydration and energy proved impactful with consumers, demonstrating our expertise in serving multiple needs with one product and communicating with the appropriate local relevance. For makeup, M-A-C sought to grow its mascara base, especially across Gen Z, younger millennial and multi-ethnic consumers and created Macstack Mascara. With breakthrough technology, the stacks and builds the last look. Macstack went viral on TikTok, having now amassed over 153 million views, and its sales far exceeded our expectations in the quarter. Tom Ford Beauty new private blend rose fragrances, feature locally relevant nodes, where Rose De Chine feature Chinese golden and Rose D'Amalfi includes Italian bergamot. This launch drove exceptional results globally, including China, where the brand had a very successful Valentine's Day. Lastly, haircare, Aveda launched botanical retail strengthening overnight serum, disrupting the category by creating our first overnight serum that builds new hair bonds while you sleep. The products sold key consumer pain points with quick-absorbing technology by leveraging a serum-based formula. Encouragingly, the product quickly rose to being the top-selling product in freestanding store and sold out on brand.com. We are excited to build upon this momentum with our new innovation center in Shanghai opens later this calendar year. This important investment in China will significantly increase our ability to serve the Chinese and Asian consumers with locally relevant and inspired innovation. Also, the new center will further enable our East to West innovation mindset, supporting the creation of more successes like La Mer's The Treatment Lotion. Looking at our growth engines by category, the strategic decision to pivot our fragrance portfolio to luxury and artisanal is benefit both top line growth and profitability. Fragrances performance in the third quarter was super with sales increasing 31% organically. Impressively, sales exceeded the pre-pandemic third quarter of fiscal year 2019 by nearly 50% on a reported basis. Jo Malone London, Tom Ford Beauty, Le Labo, KILIAN PARIS and Editions de Parfums Frederic Malle, each delivered double-digit sales growth, and Est\u00e9e Lauder brand complemented these strengths with its well-received new luxury collection. As consumers around the world increasingly express their individuality with scent, these brands are delivering outstanding results with strong double-digit growth fiscal year-to-date in every region, driven by demand across channels from brick-and-mortar to online and travel retail. There freestanding doors are driving omnichannel experiences, while their online businesses have been transformed during the pandemic. And this fragrance brands are also contributing to our sustainability goals, with refillable packaging being a compelling element of the value proposition for Le Labo and KILIAN PARIS. We are also thrilled to announce that during the third quarter, Le Labo became BCR-certified, making it the first major fragrance brand and first within our company to receive this certification, indicating a high level of commitment to sustainability and impact. Turning to makeup. It was on this call a year ago that we introduced our expectation for makeup renaissance, anticipating it would gradually evolve market by market as social and professional user educations began to resume. We envisioned the category would experience a recovery driven by both restocking as well as a renaissance rooted in a renewed passion for the joy and creativity of makeup after a difficult time. Even with the rise of the Delta and Omicron variants, the makeup renaissance has delivered very favorable trends and offers great promise for the future. As user educations expanded in certain markets upon reopening in the third quarter, makeup once again delivered double-digit organic sales growth in the Americas and EMEA. M-A-C and Clinique's makeup sales growth accelerated sequentially, while Est\u00e9e Lauder and La Mer businesses in the category are already ahead of pre-pandemic levels. While brands have been meticulous in executing their merchandising and innovation strategy for the renaissance, we invested to create the omni artist with meeting the consumers in innovative ways across brick-and-mortar and online to educate inspire new looks and offer the best in personalized high-touch services. M-A-C has been superb in this regard. So, too, has Bobbi Brown with events like live streams from the largest mall in Manchester, England to as per group classes to domain in China to one-to-one Zoom sessions in the U.S. Moving to hair care, Aveda Bumble and bumble have reignited growth engines to contribute to the diversified category growth that we expected for fiscal year 2022. Impressively, even as these brands grew sales strong double digits in brick-and-mortar or reopening during the third quarter, they also achieved mid-single-digit online growth. Lastly, while skin care was pressured by COVID restrictions in the East, the bright spots were still many. In the quarter, we continued to advance our strategies across many long-term growth drivers from luxury to prestige. La Mer performance was extraordinary, with sales rising strong double digits. As I discussed, it upgrades The Treatment Lotion sort creating a high effect on the still new hydrate infused emotion, while its heroes were highly sought after. With desirable innovation and coveted icons, La Mer is welcoming new consumers, earning their trust and traded them up as its ultra Genaissance de la Mer franchise is booming. While our high-end prestige skincare thrives with La Mer and Est\u00e9e Lauder Renotriv, Bobbi Brown is prospering in the heart of the category, thanks to its strategic focus on treasured heroes like vitamin-enriched face base. We are also laser focused on entry-level prestige to reach new consumers, notably with DECIEM the ordinary as the brand amplifies its heroes to drive repeat with its ingredient-led regiment-based approach. After the quarter closed, DECIEM announced it will be refining its brand portfolio to focus resources on the compelling opportunity we foresee for The Ordinary and NIOD. During the quarter, we also improved upon the fundamentals of consumer acquisitions, engagement and high-touch services, positioning us well to realize even greater success with trial and repeat. Our partnership with TikTok expanded, and we are piloting new innovations on the platform to be at the forefront of social commerce innovations. In the U.S., several of our brands launched storefronts on TikTok, similarly linking to brand.com. Brands also expanded their capabilities with Instagram Shopping and launched category powered lenses on Snapchat similarly linked to brand.com. Clinique realized favorable engagement trends on TikTok and Instagram, and it featured its back in stock coveted Black Honey Lipstick and strong recruitment growth with new advertising for lots of search100 hour featuring the made for social phase of adventure campaign. The Est\u00e9e Lauder brand entered the metaverse as connecting with our consumer wherever they are is paramount, and we are excited to be testing and learning in this new ecosystem. Est\u00e9e Lauder was the exclusive beauty brand partner of the Decentraland Metaverse Fashion Week, the first ever large virtual fashion week in an unchanged metaverse. Around the world, our brands are increasingly leveraging new campaign management tools to tailor communication and drive repeat to both reengage with consumers and foster relationships with new consumers. We are realizing increased reactivation and repeat purchase rate from the U.K. to France, Australia and beyond. In closing, we delivered very strong performance amid the accelerating headwinds during the third quarter. We\u2019ve also made excellent progress advancing the long-term drivers of our multiple engine of growth strategy. These results in this progress are due to the tremendous accomplishments of our employees around the world to whom I extend my deepest thanks as they continue to manage complex situation with grace and ingenuity. Moreover, I'm incredibly inspired by our employees' compassion for each other. Last week marked the two year anniversary of the ELC Cares Employee Relief Fund. The fund was created in response to employee increasing desire to support one another in times of need. Since inception, over $10 million has been distributed to employees globally from donations and company matches. Looking ahead, while we are lowering our expectation for the fourth quarter, given the impact of the temporary COVID-driven restrictions in China, we expect to deliver another record year in fiscal year 2022. We remain incredibly optimistic about the future of our business. This quarter proved the vibrancy of prestige beauty, its resiliency even in a difficult macro environment and the strength of our trusted brands and product innovations as markets sequentially recover from the prolonged pandemic. I will now turn the call over to Tracey.\nTracey Travis: Thank you, Fabrizio, and hello, everyone. Our third quarter net sales grew 9% organically despite the increased complexity and volatility caused by the pandemic and the invasion of Ukraine. Growth was broad-based across categories and markets as most regions across the world continue to recover and grow, albeit at different rates. Sales in specialty-multi and freestanding retail stores led growth and online sales rose mid-single-digits. The inclusion of sales from the late May 2021 DECIEM investment added approximately 2 points to reported net sales growth, and currency was a headwind of approximately 1 point. From a geographic standpoint, organic net sales in our Europe, the Middle East and Africa region rose 18%. Growth was realized across most markets, channels and brands. Market growth was led by both the recovery in the largest Western markets as well as in key emerging markets like Turkey and India. All brick-and-mortar channels grew, led by double-digit growth in department stores, freestanding stores and specialty-multi stores. Organic sales online declined when compared to the prior year quarter where online sales benefited both from the pandemic-driven store closures and reduced store traffic. All product categories and most brands grew in the region, led by La Mer, Jo Malone London and M-A-C. Our global travel retail business again grew double digits despite the challenges that arose during the quarter. Asia is the largest region for our travel retail business, and sales in the key markets of China and Korea were very robust at retail for most of the quarter. However, there was a precipitous decline in Chinese travel in March as restrictions to contain COVID were increased in China. We continue to see a sharp increase in travel retail sales outside of Asia as traffic increased throughout Europe and the Americas. Net sales in the Americas rose 11% organically, with all markets contributing to growth. All product categories grew with particular strength in makeup and hair care. The two largest prestige makeup brands in the U.S., M-A-C and Clinique, outpaced overall category growth to gain share. Bobbi Brown and Tom Ford Beauty also gained share helping to further drive the makeup renaissance as more consumers continued their return to the workplace and resumed more social occasions. Our sales in specialty-multi and in freestanding retail stores strongly outperformed this quarter as consumers return to stores for shopping and services. The inclusion of sales from DECIEM added approximately 3 points to growth, and favorable currency movement contributed 1 point to sales growth in the region. In our Asia-Pacific region, organic net sales fell 4%, driven entirely by Greater China. For the quarter, net sales in Mainland China declined mid-single-digits. Following a strong Lunar New Year in February, sales declined in March as additional COVID restrictions impacted many cities, most notably Shanghai, where our distribution centers serving the entire country are located. The restriction sharply curtailed productivity at these facilities, affecting our ability to both receive product being shipped into the country and to fulfill demand across all channels of distribution. However, shipments should begin to normalize as restrictions ease. Net sales in Hong Kong also declined throughout the quarter as the city took increasing measures to contain the virus. Partially offsetting these decreases with strong net sales growth in most other markets, including Japan, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore. Online sales in Asia-Pacific grew strong double digits as we continue to expand our brand reach across new platforms. Our gross margin improved 70 basis points compared to last year. Strategic price increases of approximately 4% combined with favorable currency and reduced obsolescence contributed to the increase in gross margin as well as the favorable impact of anniversary last year's under absorption of manufacturing overhead. This more than offset the impact of increased inflationary pressures in our supply chain, mainly in logistics and materials and increasing start-up costs for our new plant in Japan. Operating expenses decreased 40 basis points as a percent of sales. Our leverage of general and administrative expense was partially offset by increased shipping costs related to higher freight rates and more air shipments on increased sales volume. Additionally, as cities throughout China began tightening restrictions and traffic to Hainan slowed, we reduced certain expenses to correspond with slower retail traffic. Operating income rose 15% to $917 million, and our operating margin expanded 110 basis points to 21.6% in the quarter. Diluted EPS of $1.90 increased 17% compared to the prior year. During the quarter, we recorded $216 million of impairment to goodwill and other intangibles primarily related to Dr. Jart+, reflecting forecast for slower-than-expected growth in China and travel retail. We continue to believe in the growth potential of the brand, which has been impacted by the temporary COVID disruptions in Asia given its strong growth prior to the start of the pandemic as well as the growth seen in recovering markets. For the 9 months, we generated $1.97 billion in net cash flows from operating activities compared to $2.78 billion last year, which reflects investments in working capital to both support growth and mitigate some of the risk of supply chain disruptions as well as higher cash paid for taxes. This was partially offset by higher net income. We significantly increased our capital investment to $658 million to support the ongoing construction of our new manufacturing facility near Tokyo. Investments in our innovation center in Shanghai as well as investments in online and technology enhancements. And we returned $2.62 billion in cash to stockholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Turning now to our outlook. As you have heard and are aware, there have been two significant headwinds that have emerged since we last gave guidance in early February, increased COVID-related restrictions in China also impacting Hainan and the invasion of Ukraine. Our current guidance for the balance of this year reflects continued momentum in the Americas and EMEA excluding travel retail as well as the continuation of lockdowns and corresponding distribution constraints in China through at least the first half of our fourth quarter. While we expect continued growth at retail in both Mainland China and Hainan, the severity of the distribution constraints we are experiencing are expected to result in a meaningful decline in net sales for these areas for the quarter. We are cautiously optimistic that we will be able to fulfill the majority of our orders in time for our planned 6.18 activities. The elimination of sales in Russia and Ukraine has reduced expected fourth quarter sales growth by approximately 120 basis points. At the same time, we delivered outstanding results for the first 9 months of the fiscal year, with greater diversification of our growth drivers. Our geographic diversity is a tremendous asset, and we expect our multiple engines of growth to continue, including the ongoing recovery of the Americas, Western Europe and most markets in Asia. We expect to also deliver strong margin improvement for the year. The benefit of our strategic pricing actions this year, along with agility and our cost management are helping to offset the initial effects of increasing inflation throughout this fiscal year. We plan to continue to invest in the recovery, support innovation and assuming current disruptions abate, fuel upcoming key shopping moments in the quarter, like 6.18 in China and Mother's Day. With these assumptions as our backdrop for the full fiscal year, organic net sales are now forecasted to grow 5% to 7%. This range excludes approximately 2 points from acquisitions, divestitures and brand closures, primarily the inclusion of DECIEM, and currency is forecasted to be neutral. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $7.05 and $7.15 before restructuring in other charges. This includes approximately $0.05 of accretion from currency translation and $0.02 dilution from DECIEM. In constant currency, we expect EPS to rise by 8% to 10%. These expectations imply margin expansion of approximately 70 basis points, including dilution of 40 basis points from DECIEM this year. In closing, we managed extremely well through an increasingly complex environment in our third quarter, and these complexities are expected to meaningfully impact our fourth quarter. Despite this, we continue to expect to deliver a very strong year with above-average organic top line growth, excellent margin expansion and solid EPS growth. We are confident that we can continue to manage through the present temporary headwinds and be well prepared for accelerated momentum when the pandemic effects ease. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Your line is now open.\nLauren Lieberman: Tracey, for retail, just hoping to get a little bit more visibility, if you will, to like the on-the-ground inventory dynamic in China currently and how you're thinking about that, I guess, for the first half of the quarter. So if I were to go on any of the e-commerce sites or to a store, what do I see now? Am I able to place an order online? Or does it say out of stock? If I go to a store, is there inventory? Because I'm trying to piece together the comment, Tracey, that you saw by 6.18 you'd be caught up, but knowing that Shanghai is the way kind of in and out, and you're assuming that's constrained for the first half of the quarter? I'm just trying to put those pieces together for that fourth quarter outlook.\nTracey Travis: So it depends really on the SKU, right? And we do have -- we've had disruptions now for the last several weeks as it relates to supply chain. We certainly have had inventory in trade. But to your point, we have had some difficulties certainly shipping product to consumers. So in some cases, it's taking longer than what it normally would. And in other cases, we haven't been able to ship at all. We believe that based on some of the things that we're hearing on the ground that the market might open up in mid-May, but it's very -- it's uncertain right now. So we obviously had to put our assumptions together as it relates to the fourth quarter. And our assumptions assume that things will start to open up in mid-May. And then there will be a catch-up. So we do have the product in and around China for 6.18. It's a matter of getting it to our distribution center and then obviously, getting it out to customers in time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nSteve Powers: I'm sure there'll be more questions on China, but I actually wanted to talk about the Americas. Growth there was strong, as you called out, but it came in a little bit below our expectations. And on a 3-year basis, local currency growth, I believe, is averaging negative 3% versus pre-pandemic levels, which is a deceleration and a reversal from what we saw in the first half of the fiscal year. That's obviously -- that negative 3% CAGR is with the addition of DECIEM. So I just want a little bit more perspective on how you're viewing the recovery in the Americas, what may have caused that fluctuation in multiyear growth first half versus what we saw in the third quarter and just how to think about the progression over the balance of the calendar year.\nFabrizio Freda: Yes, sure. No, actually, we believe our North America business is actually accelerating and is in very good trend. Obviously, the sales by quarter may vary for a serious thing, including presence of holidays or presence of specific brands, innovations, et cetera. But in general, we had a plus 24% in the last 12 months and plus 10% in quarter three. If you see in that quarter three, Clinique is ranking number one overall brand, M-A-C number one in makeup, Bobbi Brown, Tom Ford, M-A-C, The Ordinary, they're all growing share. We are doing -- we are executing well the strategy of better covering all U.S. multi-ethnic consumer groups. We have improved our distribution mix, which now is more focused on high-growth, high-profit areas in general, particularly we have improved our online penetration during COVID, and we are maintaining it now. We have reestablished strong brick-and-mortar productivity, which was heavily hit by COVID, also closing 40 freestanding store and exiting a number of closing department stores doors. We are rolling out successfully the Ulta Target, the Sephora called new doors, which are proving by the way to reach new consumers. We have a stronger M-A-C and Clinique performance business, which in North America are, frankly, the two key brands that are driving the overall size of the growth. We have some strong innovation successes in quarter three. For example, Macstack, which we had mentioned in the prepared remarks, which is so far an extraordinary success. And I would underline, we are in a market where prestige has been recovery much faster pace than mass, which is exactly proving also that we are back into sourcing from mass new consumers, particularly with our entry prestige pricing brands like M-A-C, like Clinique, like The Ordinary. We also added with DECIEM acquisitions The Ordinary Brand, which is the fourth -- number fourth in prestige U.S. brands already in skin care, which is an extraordinary position and ranking first in units in many of the retail partners where they're sold. And on top on speaking about distribution, one-third of our North America business now is in direct-to-consumer model with freestanding store brand.com and certain online activity, really, including social media direct activities, which give us a lot of more data, consumer data and understanding of the consumer that we ever had in the past. So it's been years of reshaping our North America business in a condition that we believe today is strong and is much more stronger platform for continued growth and continued market share development of most of our brands in the future as well. So we are very positive of our North America trend and also very proud of today having a strong and motivated team, which is in action and which is driving the business forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi from RBC Capital. Your line is now open.\nNik Modi: For retail, I wanted to get maybe an assessment on M-A-C in the U.S. because, I guess, prior to the pandemic, the brand was under a lot of pressure. It seems like things are looking better now, but I didn't know if that's a function of just improved mobility and a makeup category lift overall or if there's an improvement in the underlying fundamentals of that brand. If you could just help kind of frame the situation for us, that would be helpful.\nFabrizio Freda: Yes. I think M-A-C is really in a strong recovery trend and is, first of all, the makeup category in general, as I explained during the prepared remarks, is in what we call the renaissance, meaning they user educations of makeup coming back, basically back to office, back to restaurants, back to parties, back to vacations, all what we have seen gradually coming back with the COVID retreating at least up to a certain extent. This is working. And with the user education coming back, the entire category is flourishing again. Plus, as I mentioned, it's important that makeup is also linked to mood, meaning the joy of interpreting personalities, interpreting yourself. So a most positive sense of recovery from COVID has been developed in the last several months, and this has benefited the category. So M-A-C is the market leader in the prestige in quarter three. And so obviously, it's benefiting of the overall category recovery. Second, the brand has now a better mix in distribution, has made important distribution choices. So it's reaching consumers better, is refocusing well on the multi-ethnic consumers have always been at the core of this brand and has extraordinary new creative power and ability to speak the M-A-C values to the consumers in new fresh ways. And innovation is back, meaning not only innovation in taste, style, looks that's been always the core of the brand, but also innovation in R&D, new ideas of performance like Macstack, which is, frankly, a technical product innovation as well, which builds on an idea, which is so close to the core M-A-C, which is makeup artistry, which is the ability to build mascara on your lashes in different stacks, and so allowing a different makeup artist interpretation or how much, how long and which locations, so the ultimate customization in mascara. That's a big deal. The consumer is answering fast and already is a leading mascara in North America and in any other market where it has been so far launched. So M-A-C is in a strong recovery trend, and we are very proud of the work of our team there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nDara Mohsenian: So just returning to China, a, just short-term detail-wise, it sounds like, hopefully, some of the supply chain restrictions could open up in mid-May. But if that's not the case, can you just discuss contingency plans in a bit more detail that Tracey touched on? Are you comfortable you can meet demand for the June holidays if the Shanghai restrictions continue? Is it more top line risk or more a question of profitability if you have to reconfigure supply chain to get product there? And then just be longer term, Fabrizio, assuming your supply chain issues do end up being outsized versus the peer set, it sounds like maybe that's the case based on some of the competitor commentary so far, but obviously, it's an issue across the board. Just any implications to your retailer relationships in China or longer-term share and how you think about that?\nTracey Travis: Yes, Dara, so I'll start. There are two things going on in the fourth quarter that are impacting us. Given the pandemic management in China right now, there is also a slowdown in traffic to Hainan. And so travel retail is being impacted as well in the fourth quarter, specifically Hainan along with China. As you saw in the third quarter when traffic slowed in our distribution and online, we pulled back on expenses, and we would be prepared to do the same in the fourth quarter if our assumptions change. The other thing that we are looking to do is have a temporary distribution center outside of the area that is most affected and hopefully, we'll mitigate some of the pressure on our Shanghai campus. So those are a couple of the things that we're planning to do as our plan B, if you will, if the market does not open up in the middle of May. But we are encouraged by some recent signs that we've seen in terms of -- or heard in terms of some of the cases coming down. But it's quite volatile, Dara, so this is the best estimate that we have at this time of the situation and what we could deliver in Q4.\nFabrizio Freda: Yes. And on your question on -- you asked about retailer relationships. We are in China for the long term and completely dedicated to continue to develop the market and serve our partners there. We are going to open soon our R&D center in China, which is a very big event and a very manifestation of long-term determination to continue to be locally relevant and serving the specific needs of this market. And obviously, we are going to do as soon as the COVID restrictions will allow us to proceed. So -- and the other thing I want to clarify that the China consumer demand underlining this moment of COVID restrictions is strong. And now it comes really from a multichannel online where it's more than 50% of the mainland sales. We grew double digit in quarter three despite what Tracey explained that in the last 15 days of March, we could not ship existing orders. That's the key point. We couldn't ship orders that we had already in our hands, both from retailers and consumers online. And so obviously, that's temporary and this happens to us in the past, in the United States, in Europe during the pandemic lockdowns. So we know how this works and how this happens, and we know also how to rebounds when this finishes because it's not about consumer demand. It's about access to consumers that has changed dramatically in a very short period of time. But the online was very, very strong, had a very strong February. And despite that, we grew market share in quarter three online, which is store despite the inability in the second half of March to serve consumers. Hainan was strong until mid-March, but then Hainan had a very strong decline of traffic. We estimate 60% to 70% in the second part of March. And in April, we saw 80% traffic reduction in Hainan. So that's what is reflected in our quarter four. But also, we have seen historically that also the bounce back can be very strong because when these restrictions finish, people travel domestically very fast and very happily. And so the confidence into Hainan future is unchanged, actually increased given the incredible development of the place and the confidence in online is very strong also because together with the continuous success with Tmall, we are also now expanding and having good expansion online with JD, within digital marketing with TikTok activations. There are so many other things, which are in the making. Brick-and-mortar was the most impacted during the restrictions. And that's -- so as of mid-March was -- and the entire month of April was really impacted in the areas where there were restrictions. It was not everywhere, but was definitely in Shanghai, where we have a lot, as we discussed the distribution center. So also want to clarify that the long-term fundamental of global prestige beauty in China and in travel retail China remains very, very good. Actually, I personally have never been more enthusiastic about the opportunity. When the market rebounds also should be much more profitable as we have seen in the U.S. because we -- because the market will rebound in travel retail, in online, in more productive brick-and-mortar and a more productive fragrance businesses than in any other region of the world because it's high-end fragrances is a much bigger percentage of the total development of the category. Also, we continue to invest in China, as Tracey has clarified. And obviously, we will tailor the investment to the level of access to consumers that the restriction will permit, but we will invest in the growth in the innovation center. There will be more brands in China coming to additional cities coverage as soon as the permissions the restrictions will allow. I spoke already about the strongest plans with our partner Tmall and further diversification of the coverage in the country. The category growth expansion beyond skin care, makeup, fragrances are coming up strongly. The supply chain that needs to be further diversified Tracey has alluded to, but we had already planned for fiscal year 2023 and '24 to have more regional distribution centers that we will deploy, but in the meantime, we'll look for certain temporary activity. Hainan expansion is also a story. There are new mega counters getting expanded in Hainan as we speak for -- not only for us, also for competition, but are extraordinarily new opportunities, which we are in the making temporary. Obviously, in this moment, as I said, there is little traffic. But in the -- for example, in July-September period, there will be more of discount expanded. The expectation for 6.18, assuming that the logistics can be resolved, is pretty strong. And also, I want to underline that we hear that it's very likely there will be more economic stimulus ahead in the country that will further develop consumptions in the next 12 to 18 months. So I just want to underline, I hope it was clear that we are really trying to be as prudent and objective as possible in reflecting the COVID restrictions. But we remain absolutely determined to continue to build our China and China TR businesses.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira from J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.\nAndrea Teixeira : Fabrizio, you mentioned that you're comfortable when to fulfill when you're able to. So I was hoping to see what was the impact in volumes of orders that were made online in China for your organic growth. And also just a clarification on Tracey's comments on the pricing front with, I think, a 400 basis point impact of pricing in the quarter. So I was hoping to hear what is the rollover impact on the carryover into the fourth quarter and the mix impact. I'm assuming the mix was a negative given that you're selling less -- on a relative basis, you're growing less in skincare. Hope you share all of those.\nTracey Travis: So let me start, Andrea, with the pricing. My 400 basis points really was for the second half of the year. We started the year taking 3.5% of pricing increase. And typically, we take most of our pricing increases at the beginning of our fiscal year. We did take a second price increase in January. So the impact year-over-year for our second half is 4% pricing relative to prior year. And we expect to, in our upcoming -- the beginning of our upcoming fiscal year in July, take additional pricing. So -- and that pricing is strategic between levels within the tiers of our categories. So yes, skincare or higher-priced skincare might take higher price pricing, our lower-priced skin care would take lower price increases. It's very much dependent on the market, the currency, the inflation there's a very sophisticated model that we use to determine what pricing for our various brands. So yes, we will have lower skincare sales in the fourth quarter. But on average, the pricing increases that we've taken will still be around 4%, and we do expect that they would cover the inflation that we are experiencing at the moment.\nFabrizio Freda: And answering the first part of your question, which is how much we could not ship. Frankly, I cannot distinguish the online versus the brick-and-mortar. But I can tell you that as of March 15, when we couldn't for 15 days of the quarter ship the orders we had, the order we had in our hands that we did not ship in the moment where 2.5 points of growth for the entire quarter. So a substantial amount of shipments. And then April also and the beginning of May also, we had limited capacity shipments. And also importantly, in the quarter three numbers that you see, the impact of the pandemic was mainly reflected in the Mainland China impact, while TR had a very strong quarter despite there was less traffic in the second part of March. So somehow ended up with higher stocks is in our assumptions. And then in the quarter four expectation, there is a bigger proportion of the impact of the reduced traffic in Hainan than there is, frankly, an impact in China. And so that's also maybe give you a bit more light on our assumptions in this very difficult situation, frankly, to interpret in a detailed level given the very high volatility.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nBryan Spillane: Fabrizio, you mentioned in the prepared remarks or maybe in the Q&A, just maybe an expectation that there could be some stimulus in China. And I guess one of the questions we've got this morning was whether or not any of the softness that you've seen in China is all connected to the consumer feeling the impact of the economy slowing or recession risk. So can you just touch on that a little bit just in terms of whether or not you've seen any sort of impact on demand or any consumer behavior patterns based on the economy slowing in China?\nFabrizio Freda: No. So far, we are not seeing any impact in this area, also because -- not only because, as I said, the demand remained robust, and you can look at the demand -- you need to look at the demand in China in this moment since when global COVID started mainly, since when Chinese started traveling internationally less. You need to look at it like the brick-and-mortar in China, the online in China and Hainan. The combination of these three has been very, very strong, even if you look at our quarter three and you put together the results in together with the results in Mainland China online, as I said before, we were growing market share and growing double digit and the brick-and-mortar very soft moment. But when you put it all together, you see demand growth. When you look only Mainland China or only Hainan in certain moments without -- you may see different patterns by channel, but the total Chinese consumption has been very, very solid for us, for the industry, for competition in general. The other important thing to clarify that this is not changing also in the composition. For example, the most important segment in this moment in the China demand is high-end luxury brands. So both in our portfolio, brands like La Mer or Tom Ford or in our competitive portfolio or within our portfolio within a brand like Lauder, the performance of Renotriv, which is the high-end part of the brand. So everywhere, the high luxury part is doing better in growth than any other part. This doesn't suggest that the consumers are worried by the economy. This suggests the consumers are actually looking for high performance and strong experiences more and more in this moment. Said this, there is obviously a lower economic than expectation in this moment, but also, there is a lot of trust in the possibility of economic stimulus and in the possibilities of restarting stronger economic development. So I believe that the consumer sentiment is still overall solid.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Korinne Wolfmeyer from Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nKorinne Wolfmeyer: Kind of expanding on that last question on consumer sentiment more broadly. How have the recent developments macro-wise affect or kind of changed your viewpoint or impacted your viewpoint on the resiliency of prestige beauty as a category more broadly geographically both here in the U.S. and in EMEA and in APAC? We've seen these consumer-centric numbers start to get a little bit depressed over the past few weeks. So just wondering how you're viewing the resiliency of prestige beauty in these market dynamics.\nFabrizio Freda: Yes. No. I have to say that the -- we see the consumer sentiment, obviously, a different level of development by region. So first of all, the U.S., the consumer sentiment is solid. And in the U.S. is very interesting. You can also read the results by channel. And you see that prestige continues to grow and to accelerate in the post-COVID environment, at least from a consumer sentiment standpoint. The consumer -- sorry, prestige accelerate much faster than mass. They both are growing, but prestige is growing much more. And this is a sign. Again, this is a sign that consumers feel the confidence to go for quality, for performance, for experience and for what they feel connected to and the more and more. And to go back to the pleasure, to the joy to the self-pampering feelings, which are overall a positive consumer sentiment. But a positive doesn't mean necessarily trust in the long-term economy. Positive in what move beauty is a positive consumer sentiment also in the sense of the interest in dedicating to yourself, the interest in pampering yourself is actually the consumer center that is better explained by the coming out of very difficult periods rather than by necessarily only economic trends. And so that consumer sentiment is the one that pushed prestige beauty in general around the world. And this consumer sentiment is sometimes even stronger in movement of high stress because there is more pampering needs. So strong in the U.S., I believe still solid in China, better in many other markets like Japan, like U.K., like the markets -- sorry, you can mention in a second, like Japan, like other markets in Asia, Korea, Singapore, which are all recovering from a tough COVID period. The only area where the consumer sentiment, as you know, is going down is Europe, and it's not because economical results because also in Europe there is pleasure of getting out of the pandemic pressure as a sentiment. But the war in Ukraine is obviously creating a very bad feeling around people. And so people are sad and there is this element the sentiment that create a mixed consumer sentiment at this moment in Europe. But that's the only area where the numbers suggest this. By the way, the number is not the business. The business in prestige beauty remains very, very solid, suggesting what I was explaining, which is the consumer sentiment, it is a mix of economic, external pressure like the world, but also how they feel in terms of how much they need to take care of themselves, to pamper themselves in this very difficult environment. So in that sense, prestige beauty is more resilient to these kind of situations than many other markets.\nTracey Travis: And the only thing I would add to that is even as we've commented, the fragrance category during this time has picked up, so to Fabrizio's point in terms of self tampering and prestige hair care. So we're actually seeing an acceleration in some categories of prestige during this time, particularly in the markets that are in recovery. So this really is a temporary situation that we're experiencing now and into the fourth quarter. Our team on the ground in China has been working diligently to try to get product to consumers, respecting obviously, the restrictions that are in place and staying healthy. And we are incredibly thankful to them for all of the things that they're doing to make sure that they can as best they can under these circumstances meet the demand of our consumers in China who really are looking for our products, and we'll get them as soon as we can get them to them so.\nOperator: We have time for one last question. Your last question comes from the line of Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group. Your line is now open.\nDana Telsey: As you think about the categories of makeup and skincare, what are you looking at for skincare going forward as makeup is recovering so strongly in terms of new product releases? And then any expansion of what you're seeing at the new Ulta and Target relationships and your product expansion there?\nFabrizio Freda: Yes, sure. Skincare will continue to develop. Actually, one of the key thing is happening is the skinification of many categories, including hair care. The skincare key trends are increasing. And what's happening in a very broad sense on top of anti-aging that remain very important, particularly with the growth of the more mature consumers growth in numbers and in interest in the category, what's happening is that skincare is entering category of instant benefits than in the past where basically only makeup area. Today, skincare is about anti-aging, is about also instant benefit. For instant benefit, I mean, I don't know, luminosity, even skin tone, brightness and there are so many different benefits that today are linked to how the skin looks in the day. You use it rather than just over time. And so the category is bigger, is that there are more usage occasions and there are more user reason, basically more benefits. And the industry is providing some amazing technology and some great progress in this area. On top of that, the penetration of skin care among different target groups and also younger target groups linked to the better penetration of instant benefits is increasing around the world. So frankly, we have a very positive view in skincare in the long term. Obviously, skincare is very strong in Asia and particularly in China. And so in a moment of restrictions like in China now, you will see less strong growth in skincare, but this, again, is temporary as we have explained of the entire situation. But the long-term skincare trend remains strong. In terms of the situation of Target call\u2019s -- Target and Kohl -- yes, Target, Ulta and Kohl\u2019s Sephora stores, we are pretty happy of the initial results there. These accounted for the moment only 3 points of growth in total, but for the quarter and of North America. But the most important news is that it's bringing new consumers. So a lot of this is extra and give us the possibility to access new consumers, and our brands are doing very well in those spaces with these consumers. So this also is a good trend in the right direction, but it's only the beginning of the journey.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference and today's question-and-answer session.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Fabrizio Freda",
            "content": "Thank you, Rainey, and hello to everyone. I want to begin by expressing the great sadness where for our colleagues and all the people impacted by the envision of Ukraine, who are experiencing a devastating humanitarian crisis. We continue to focus on our employee safety, and our dearest hope is for peace to prevail. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, we delivered organic sales growth of 9%, in line with our guidance despite the acceleration of temporary COVID-19 restriction in China in March. We exercised cost discipline as volatility increased, and our adjusted operating margin expanded, leading to stronger-than-expected adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of 17%. Our multiple engines of growth strategy enabled us to amplify the engines of the moment amid intensified macro environment, with sales rising organically across both brick-and-mortar and online. Every category grew organically, led by fragrances' outstanding performance. 11 brands contributed double-digit organic sales growth and further demonstrated our diversified drivers. Consumer demand remains robust even in this inflationary environment. Our largest brands provided highly sought-after, M-A-C, Este\u0301e Lauder and Clinique each delivered double-digit growth in makeup, fueling the category renaissance while La Mer thrived in skin care. Four of our scaling brands resonated strongly with consumers as Jo Malone London, Tom Ford Beauty, Aveda and Bobbi Brown each rose double digits. Among our developing brands, Le Labo, KILIAN PARIS and Bumble and bumble each achieved outsized growth and showcased their promise. Our sales rose double digit organically in the Americas and EMEA. We capitalize on reopening to translate improving brick-and-mortar traffic trends into outstanding sales growth, owing to our high-touch services, breakthrough innovation, hero franchises and operational excellence. Our freestanding stores delivered exceptional performance benefiting from fleet optimization and expanded omnichannel capabilities and complement the strengths in specialty multi. We are managing the ongoing complexities from the invasion of Ukraine as well as the temporary COVID-driven restrictions in China, which impacted performance in Asia-Pacific in the quarter. In Mainland China, organic sales fell mid-single-digit as 25% growth online was offset by a steep decline in brick-and-mortar. After a strong February, in Mainland China, traffic slowed more sharply in March to pressure brick-and-mortar sales. Additionally, for us, the distribution centers for our Mainland China business are in Shanghai and operated with limited capacity. Tourism to Hainan highland was also curtailed in March after a vibrant start of the quarter. There is no doubt that these current limitations in China will prove to be transitory, although there will be a far greater impact on our results in the fourth quarter than they were in the third quarter, as Tracy will discuss. Looking ahead, we are confident in the resilience of the Chinese consumers and the untapped opportunity driving our investments in the market. We expect a reacceleration of growth when this moment of COVID abates. Let me share the progress we made during the third quarter to drive these strong results and advance our long-term ambitions for our multiple engine of growth strategy. Innovation excelled to reach nearly 30% of sales. We continue to elevate our ability to leverage data analytics with our best-in-class creative talent and R&D to successfully anticipate scale and set trends. The breadth of our innovation wins was far-reaching and benefited every category in skincare, La Mer upgraded The Treatment Lotion sort as the brand doubled down on this coveted East-West product, increasing the skin recharging Miracle Broad and transitioning to a recyclable luxurious glass bottle that contains 20% post-consumer recycled content. In Asia-Pacific, consumer gravitated to the new serum strengths and anti-aging benefits, while in the Americas, educating on the benefits of hydration and energy proved impactful with consumers, demonstrating our expertise in serving multiple needs with one product and communicating with the appropriate local relevance. For makeup, M-A-C sought to grow its mascara base, especially across Gen Z, younger millennial and multi-ethnic consumers and created Macstack Mascara. With breakthrough technology, the stacks and builds the last look. Macstack went viral on TikTok, having now amassed over 153 million views, and its sales far exceeded our expectations in the quarter. Tom Ford Beauty new private blend rose fragrances, feature locally relevant nodes, where Rose De Chine feature Chinese golden and Rose D'Amalfi includes Italian bergamot. This launch drove exceptional results globally, including China, where the brand had a very successful Valentine's Day. Lastly, haircare, Aveda launched botanical retail strengthening overnight serum, disrupting the category by creating our first overnight serum that builds new hair bonds while you sleep. The products sold key consumer pain points with quick-absorbing technology by leveraging a serum-based formula. Encouragingly, the product quickly rose to being the top-selling product in freestanding store and sold out on brand.com. We are excited to build upon this momentum with our new innovation center in Shanghai opens later this calendar year. This important investment in China will significantly increase our ability to serve the Chinese and Asian consumers with locally relevant and inspired innovation. Also, the new center will further enable our East to West innovation mindset, supporting the creation of more successes like La Mer's The Treatment Lotion. Looking at our growth engines by category, the strategic decision to pivot our fragrance portfolio to luxury and artisanal is benefit both top line growth and profitability. Fragrances performance in the third quarter was super with sales increasing 31% organically. Impressively, sales exceeded the pre-pandemic third quarter of fiscal year 2019 by nearly 50% on a reported basis. Jo Malone London, Tom Ford Beauty, Le Labo, KILIAN PARIS and Editions de Parfums Frederic Malle, each delivered double-digit sales growth, and Este\u0301e Lauder brand complemented these strengths with its well-received new luxury collection. As consumers around the world increasingly express their individuality with scent, these brands are delivering outstanding results with strong double-digit growth fiscal year-to-date in every region, driven by demand across channels from brick-and-mortar to online and travel retail. There freestanding doors are driving omnichannel experiences, while their online businesses have been transformed during the pandemic. And this fragrance brands are also contributing to our sustainability goals, with refillable packaging being a compelling element of the value proposition for Le Labo and KILIAN PARIS. We are also thrilled to announce that during the third quarter, Le Labo became BCR-certified, making it the first major fragrance brand and first within our company to receive this certification, indicating a high level of commitment to sustainability and impact. Turning to makeup. It was on this call a year ago that we introduced our expectation for makeup renaissance, anticipating it would gradually evolve market by market as social and professional user educations began to resume. We envisioned the category would experience a recovery driven by both restocking as well as a renaissance rooted in a renewed passion for the joy and creativity of makeup after a difficult time. Even with the rise of the Delta and Omicron variants, the makeup renaissance has delivered very favorable trends and offers great promise for the future. As user educations expanded in certain markets upon reopening in the third quarter, makeup once again delivered double-digit organic sales growth in the Americas and EMEA. M-A-C and Clinique's makeup sales growth accelerated sequentially, while Este\u0301e Lauder and La Mer businesses in the category are already ahead of pre-pandemic levels. While brands have been meticulous in executing their merchandising and innovation strategy for the renaissance, we invested to create the omni artist with meeting the consumers in innovative ways across brick-and-mortar and online to educate inspire new looks and offer the best in personalized high-touch services. M-A-C has been superb in this regard. So, too, has Bobbi Brown with events like live streams from the largest mall in Manchester, England to as per group classes to domain in China to one-to-one Zoom sessions in the U.S. Moving to hair care, Aveda Bumble and bumble have reignited growth engines to contribute to the diversified category growth that we expected for fiscal year 2022. Impressively, even as these brands grew sales strong double digits in brick-and-mortar or reopening during the third quarter, they also achieved mid-single-digit online growth. Lastly, while skin care was pressured by COVID restrictions in the East, the bright spots were still many. In the quarter, we continued to advance our strategies across many long-term growth drivers from luxury to prestige. La Mer performance was extraordinary, with sales rising strong double digits. As I discussed, it upgrades The Treatment Lotion sort creating a high effect on the still new hydrate infused emotion, while its heroes were highly sought after. With desirable innovation and coveted icons, La Mer is welcoming new consumers, earning their trust and traded them up as its ultra Genaissance de la Mer franchise is booming. While our high-end prestige skincare thrives with La Mer and Este\u0301e Lauder Renotriv, Bobbi Brown is prospering in the heart of the category, thanks to its strategic focus on treasured heroes like vitamin-enriched face base. We are also laser focused on entry-level prestige to reach new consumers, notably with DECIEM the ordinary as the brand amplifies its heroes to drive repeat with its ingredient-led regiment-based approach. After the quarter closed, DECIEM announced it will be refining its brand portfolio to focus resources on the compelling opportunity we foresee for The Ordinary and NIOD. During the quarter, we also improved upon the fundamentals of consumer acquisitions, engagement and high-touch services, positioning us well to realize even greater success with trial and repeat. Our partnership with TikTok expanded, and we are piloting new innovations on the platform to be at the forefront of social commerce innovations. In the U.S., several of our brands launched storefronts on TikTok, similarly linking to brand.com. Brands also expanded their capabilities with Instagram Shopping and launched category powered lenses on Snapchat similarly linked to brand.com. Clinique realized favorable engagement trends on TikTok and Instagram, and it featured its back in stock coveted Black Honey Lipstick and strong recruitment growth with new advertising for lots of search100 hour featuring the made for social phase of adventure campaign. The Este\u0301e Lauder brand entered the metaverse as connecting with our consumer wherever they are is paramount, and we are excited to be testing and learning in this new ecosystem. Este\u0301e Lauder was the exclusive beauty brand partner of the Decentraland Metaverse Fashion Week, the first ever large virtual fashion week in an unchanged metaverse. Around the world, our brands are increasingly leveraging new campaign management tools to tailor communication and drive repeat to both reengage with consumers and foster relationships with new consumers. We are realizing increased reactivation and repeat purchase rate from the U.K. to France, Australia and beyond. In closing, we delivered very strong performance amid the accelerating headwinds during the third quarter. We've also made excellent progress advancing the long-term drivers of our multiple engine of growth strategy. These results in this progress are due to the tremendous accomplishments of our employees around the world to whom I extend my deepest thanks as they continue to manage complex situation with grace and ingenuity. Moreover, I'm incredibly inspired by our employees' compassion for each other. Last week marked the two year anniversary of the ELC Cares Employee Relief Fund. The fund was created in response to employee increasing desire to support one another in times of need. Since inception, over $10 million has been distributed to employees globally from donations and company matches. Looking ahead, while we are lowering our expectation for the fourth quarter, given the impact of the temporary COVID-driven restrictions in China, we expect to deliver another record year in fiscal year 2022. We remain incredibly optimistic about the future of our business. This quarter proved the vibrancy of prestige beauty, its resiliency even in a difficult macro environment and the strength of our trusted brands and product innovations as markets sequentially recover from the prolonged pandemic. I will now turn the call over to Tracey. Yes, sure. No, actually, we believe our North America business is actually accelerating and is in very good trend. Obviously, the sales by quarter may vary for a serious thing, including presence of holidays or presence of specific brands, innovations, et cetera. But in general, we had a plus 24% in the last 12 months and plus 10% in quarter three. If you see in that quarter three, Clinique is ranking number one overall brand, M-A-C number one in makeup, Bobbi Brown, Tom Ford, M-A-C, The Ordinary, they're all growing share. We are doing -- we are executing well the strategy of better covering all U.S. multi-ethnic consumer groups. We have improved our distribution mix, which now is more focused on high-growth, high-profit areas in general, particularly we have improved our online penetration during COVID, and we are maintaining it now. We have reestablished strong brick-and-mortar productivity, which was heavily hit by COVID, also closing 40 freestanding store and exiting a number of closing department stores doors. We are rolling out successfully the Ulta Target, the Sephora called new doors, which are proving by the way to reach new consumers. We have a stronger M-A-C and Clinique performance business, which in North America are, frankly, the two key brands that are driving the overall size of the growth. We have some strong innovation successes in quarter three. For example, Macstack, which we had mentioned in the prepared remarks, which is so far an extraordinary success. And I would underline, we are in a market where prestige has been recovery much faster pace than mass, which is exactly proving also that we are back into sourcing from mass new consumers, particularly with our entry prestige pricing brands like M-A-C, like Clinique, like The Ordinary. We also added with DECIEM acquisitions The Ordinary Brand, which is the fourth -- number fourth in prestige U.S. brands already in skin care, which is an extraordinary position and ranking first in units in many of the retail partners where they're sold. And on top on speaking about distribution, one-third of our North America business now is in direct-to-consumer model with freestanding store brand.com and certain online activity, really, including social media direct activities, which give us a lot of more data, consumer data and understanding of the consumer that we ever had in the past. So it's been years of reshaping our North America business in a condition that we believe today is strong and is much more stronger platform for continued growth and continued market share development of most of our brands in the future as well. So we are very positive of our North America trend and also very proud of today having a strong and motivated team, which is in action and which is driving the business forward. Yes. I think M-A-C is really in a strong recovery trend and is, first of all, the makeup category in general, as I explained during the prepared remarks, is in what we call the renaissance, meaning they user educations of makeup coming back, basically back to office, back to restaurants, back to parties, back to vacations, all what we have seen gradually coming back with the COVID retreating at least up to a certain extent. This is working. And with the user education coming back, the entire category is flourishing again. Plus, as I mentioned, it's important that makeup is also linked to mood, meaning the joy of interpreting personalities, interpreting yourself. So a most positive sense of recovery from COVID has been developed in the last several months, and this has benefited the category. So M-A-C is the market leader in the prestige in quarter three. And so obviously, it's benefiting of the overall category recovery. Second, the brand has now a better mix in distribution, has made important distribution choices. So it's reaching consumers better, is refocusing well on the multi-ethnic consumers have always been at the core of this brand and has extraordinary new creative power and ability to speak the M-A-C values to the consumers in new fresh ways. And innovation is back, meaning not only innovation in taste, style, looks that's been always the core of the brand, but also innovation in R&D, new ideas of performance like Macstack, which is, frankly, a technical product innovation as well, which builds on an idea, which is so close to the core M-A-C, which is makeup artistry, which is the ability to build mascara on your lashes in different stacks, and so allowing a different makeup artist interpretation or how much, how long and which locations, so the ultimate customization in mascara. That's a big deal. The consumer is answering fast and already is a leading mascara in North America and in any other market where it has been so far launched. So M-A-C is in a strong recovery trend, and we are very proud of the work of our team there. Yes. And on your question on -- you asked about retailer relationships. We are in China for the long term and completely dedicated to continue to develop the market and serve our partners there. We are going to open soon our R&D center in China, which is a very big event and a very manifestation of long-term determination to continue to be locally relevant and serving the specific needs of this market. And obviously, we are going to do as soon as the COVID restrictions will allow us to proceed. So -- and the other thing I want to clarify that the China consumer demand underlining this moment of COVID restrictions is strong. And now it comes really from a multichannel online where it's more than 50% of the mainland sales. We grew double digit in quarter three despite what Tracey explained that in the last 15 days of March, we could not ship existing orders. That's the key point. We couldn't ship orders that we had already in our hands, both from retailers and consumers online. And so obviously, that's temporary and this happens to us in the past, in the United States, in Europe during the pandemic lockdowns. So we know how this works and how this happens, and we know also how to rebounds when this finishes because it's not about consumer demand. It's about access to consumers that has changed dramatically in a very short period of time. But the online was very, very strong, had a very strong February. And despite that, we grew market share in quarter three online, which is store despite the inability in the second half of March to serve consumers. Hainan was strong until mid-March, but then Hainan had a very strong decline of traffic. We estimate 60% to 70% in the second part of March. And in April, we saw 80% traffic reduction in Hainan. So that's what is reflected in our quarter four. But also, we have seen historically that also the bounce back can be very strong because when these restrictions finish, people travel domestically very fast and very happily. And so the confidence into Hainan future is unchanged, actually increased given the incredible development of the place and the confidence in online is very strong also because together with the continuous success with Tmall, we are also now expanding and having good expansion online with JD, within digital marketing with TikTok activations. There are so many other things, which are in the making. Brick-and-mortar was the most impacted during the restrictions. And that's -- so as of mid-March was -- and the entire month of April was really impacted in the areas where there were restrictions. It was not everywhere, but was definitely in Shanghai, where we have a lot, as we discussed the distribution center. So also want to clarify that the long-term fundamental of global prestige beauty in China and in travel retail China remains very, very good. Actually, I personally have never been more enthusiastic about the opportunity. When the market rebounds also should be much more profitable as we have seen in the U.S. because we -- because the market will rebound in travel retail, in online, in more productive brick-and-mortar and a more productive fragrance businesses than in any other region of the world because it's high-end fragrances is a much bigger percentage of the total development of the category. Also, we continue to invest in China, as Tracey has clarified. And obviously, we will tailor the investment to the level of access to consumers that the restriction will permit, but we will invest in the growth in the innovation center. There will be more brands in China coming to additional cities coverage as soon as the permissions the restrictions will allow. I spoke already about the strongest plans with our partner Tmall and further diversification of the coverage in the country. The category growth expansion beyond skin care, makeup, fragrances are coming up strongly. The supply chain that needs to be further diversified Tracey has alluded to, but we had already planned for fiscal year 2023 and '24 to have more regional distribution centers that we will deploy, but in the meantime, we'll look for certain temporary activity. Hainan expansion is also a story. There are new mega counters getting expanded in Hainan as we speak for -- not only for us, also for competition, but are extraordinarily new opportunities, which we are in the making temporary. Obviously, in this moment, as I said, there is little traffic. But in the -- for example, in July-September period, there will be more of discount expanded. The expectation for 6.18, assuming that the logistics can be resolved, is pretty strong. And also, I want to underline that we hear that it's very likely there will be more economic stimulus ahead in the country that will further develop consumptions in the next 12 to 18 months. So I just want to underline, I hope it was clear that we are really trying to be as prudent and objective as possible in reflecting the COVID restrictions. But we remain absolutely determined to continue to build our China and China TR businesses. And answering the first part of your question, which is how much we could not ship. Frankly, I cannot distinguish the online versus the brick-and-mortar. But I can tell you that as of March 15, when we couldn't for 15 days of the quarter ship the orders we had, the order we had in our hands that we did not ship in the moment where 2.5 points of growth for the entire quarter. So a substantial amount of shipments. And then April also and the beginning of May also, we had limited capacity shipments. And also importantly, in the quarter three numbers that you see, the impact of the pandemic was mainly reflected in the Mainland China impact, while TR had a very strong quarter despite there was less traffic in the second part of March. So somehow ended up with higher stocks is in our assumptions. And then in the quarter four expectation, there is a bigger proportion of the impact of the reduced traffic in Hainan than there is, frankly, an impact in China. And so that's also maybe give you a bit more light on our assumptions in this very difficult situation, frankly, to interpret in a detailed level given the very high volatility. No. So far, we are not seeing any impact in this area, also because -- not only because, as I said, the demand remained robust, and you can look at the demand -- you need to look at the demand in China in this moment since when global COVID started mainly, since when Chinese started traveling internationally less. You need to look at it like the brick-and-mortar in China, the online in China and Hainan. The combination of these three has been very, very strong, even if you look at our quarter three and you put together the results in together with the results in Mainland China online, as I said before, we were growing market share and growing double digit and the brick-and-mortar very soft moment. But when you put it all together, you see demand growth. When you look only Mainland China or only Hainan in certain moments without -- you may see different patterns by channel, but the total Chinese consumption has been very, very solid for us, for the industry, for competition in general. The other important thing to clarify that this is not changing also in the composition. For example, the most important segment in this moment in the China demand is high-end luxury brands. So both in our portfolio, brands like La Mer or Tom Ford or in our competitive portfolio or within our portfolio within a brand like Lauder, the performance of Renotriv, which is the high-end part of the brand. So everywhere, the high luxury part is doing better in growth than any other part. This doesn't suggest that the consumers are worried by the economy. This suggests the consumers are actually looking for high performance and strong experiences more and more in this moment. Said this, there is obviously a lower economic than expectation in this moment, but also, there is a lot of trust in the possibility of economic stimulus and in the possibilities of restarting stronger economic development. So I believe that the consumer sentiment is still overall solid. Yes. No. I have to say that the -- we see the consumer sentiment, obviously, a different level of development by region. So first of all, the U.S., the consumer sentiment is solid. And in the U.S. is very interesting. You can also read the results by channel. And you see that prestige continues to grow and to accelerate in the post-COVID environment, at least from a consumer sentiment standpoint. The consumer -- sorry, prestige accelerate much faster than mass. They both are growing, but prestige is growing much more. And this is a sign. Again, this is a sign that consumers feel the confidence to go for quality, for performance, for experience and for what they feel connected to and the more and more. And to go back to the pleasure, to the joy to the self-pampering feelings, which are overall a positive consumer sentiment. But a positive doesn't mean necessarily trust in the long-term economy. Positive in what move beauty is a positive consumer sentiment also in the sense of the interest in dedicating to yourself, the interest in pampering yourself is actually the consumer center that is better explained by the coming out of very difficult periods rather than by necessarily only economic trends. And so that consumer sentiment is the one that pushed prestige beauty in general around the world. And this consumer sentiment is sometimes even stronger in movement of high stress because there is more pampering needs. So strong in the U.S., I believe still solid in China, better in many other markets like Japan, like U.K., like the markets -- sorry, you can mention in a second, like Japan, like other markets in Asia, Korea, Singapore, which are all recovering from a tough COVID period. The only area where the consumer sentiment, as you know, is going down is Europe, and it's not because economical results because also in Europe there is pleasure of getting out of the pandemic pressure as a sentiment. But the war in Ukraine is obviously creating a very bad feeling around people. And so people are sad and there is this element the sentiment that create a mixed consumer sentiment at this moment in Europe. But that's the only area where the numbers suggest this. By the way, the number is not the business. The business in prestige beauty remains very, very solid, suggesting what I was explaining, which is the consumer sentiment, it is a mix of economic, external pressure like the world, but also how they feel in terms of how much they need to take care of themselves, to pamper themselves in this very difficult environment. So in that sense, prestige beauty is more resilient to these kind of situations than many other markets. Yes, sure. Skincare will continue to develop. Actually, one of the key thing is happening is the skinification of many categories, including hair care. The skincare key trends are increasing. And what's happening in a very broad sense on top of anti-aging that remain very important, particularly with the growth of the more mature consumers growth in numbers and in interest in the category, what's happening is that skincare is entering category of instant benefits than in the past where basically only makeup area. Today, skincare is about anti-aging, is about also instant benefit. For instant benefit, I mean, I don't know, luminosity, even skin tone, brightness and there are so many different benefits that today are linked to how the skin looks in the day. You use it rather than just over time. And so the category is bigger, is that there are more usage occasions and there are more user reason, basically more benefits. And the industry is providing some amazing technology and some great progress in this area. On top of that, the penetration of skin care among different target groups and also younger target groups linked to the better penetration of instant benefits is increasing around the world. So frankly, we have a very positive view in skincare in the long term. Obviously, skincare is very strong in Asia and particularly in China. And so in a moment of restrictions like in China now, you will see less strong growth in skincare, but this, again, is temporary as we have explained of the entire situation. But the long-term skincare trend remains strong. In terms of the situation of Target call's -- Target and Kohl -- yes, Target, Ulta and Kohl's Sephora stores, we are pretty happy of the initial results there. These accounted for the moment only 3 points of growth in total, but for the quarter and of North America. But the most important news is that it's bringing new consumers. So a lot of this is extra and give us the possibility to access new consumers, and our brands are doing very well in those spaces with these consumers. So this also is a good trend in the right direction, but it's only the beginning of the journey."

            "name": "Tracey Travis",
            "content": "Thank you, Fabrizio, and hello, everyone. Our third quarter net sales grew 9% organically despite the increased complexity and volatility caused by the pandemic and the invasion of Ukraine. Growth was broad-based across categories and markets as most regions across the world continue to recover and grow, albeit at different rates. Sales in specialty-multi and freestanding retail stores led growth and online sales rose mid-single-digits. The inclusion of sales from the late May 2021 DECIEM investment added approximately 2 points to reported net sales growth, and currency was a headwind of approximately 1 point. From a geographic standpoint, organic net sales in our Europe, the Middle East and Africa region rose 18%. Growth was realized across most markets, channels and brands. Market growth was led by both the recovery in the largest Western markets as well as in key emerging markets like Turkey and India. All brick-and-mortar channels grew, led by double-digit growth in department stores, freestanding stores and specialty-multi stores. Organic sales online declined when compared to the prior year quarter where online sales benefited both from the pandemic-driven store closures and reduced store traffic. All product categories and most brands grew in the region, led by La Mer, Jo Malone London and M-A-C. Our global travel retail business again grew double digits despite the challenges that arose during the quarter. Asia is the largest region for our travel retail business, and sales in the key markets of China and Korea were very robust at retail for most of the quarter. However, there was a precipitous decline in Chinese travel in March as restrictions to contain COVID were increased in China. We continue to see a sharp increase in travel retail sales outside of Asia as traffic increased throughout Europe and the Americas. Net sales in the Americas rose 11% organically, with all markets contributing to growth. All product categories grew with particular strength in makeup and hair care. The two largest prestige makeup brands in the U.S., M-A-C and Clinique, outpaced overall category growth to gain share. Bobbi Brown and Tom Ford Beauty also gained share helping to further drive the makeup renaissance as more consumers continued their return to the workplace and resumed more social occasions. Our sales in specialty-multi and in freestanding retail stores strongly outperformed this quarter as consumers return to stores for shopping and services. The inclusion of sales from DECIEM added approximately 3 points to growth, and favorable currency movement contributed 1 point to sales growth in the region. In our Asia-Pacific region, organic net sales fell 4%, driven entirely by Greater China. For the quarter, net sales in Mainland China declined mid-single-digits. Following a strong Lunar New Year in February, sales declined in March as additional COVID restrictions impacted many cities, most notably Shanghai, where our distribution centers serving the entire country are located. The restriction sharply curtailed productivity at these facilities, affecting our ability to both receive product being shipped into the country and to fulfill demand across all channels of distribution. However, shipments should begin to normalize as restrictions ease. Net sales in Hong Kong also declined throughout the quarter as the city took increasing measures to contain the virus. Partially offsetting these decreases with strong net sales growth in most other markets, including Japan, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore. Online sales in Asia-Pacific grew strong double digits as we continue to expand our brand reach across new platforms. Our gross margin improved 70 basis points compared to last year. Strategic price increases of approximately 4% combined with favorable currency and reduced obsolescence contributed to the increase in gross margin as well as the favorable impact of anniversary last year's under absorption of manufacturing overhead. This more than offset the impact of increased inflationary pressures in our supply chain, mainly in logistics and materials and increasing start-up costs for our new plant in Japan. Operating expenses decreased 40 basis points as a percent of sales. Our leverage of general and administrative expense was partially offset by increased shipping costs related to higher freight rates and more air shipments on increased sales volume. Additionally, as cities throughout China began tightening restrictions and traffic to Hainan slowed, we reduced certain expenses to correspond with slower retail traffic. Operating income rose 15% to $917 million, and our operating margin expanded 110 basis points to 21.6% in the quarter. Diluted EPS of $1.90 increased 17% compared to the prior year. During the quarter, we recorded $216 million of impairment to goodwill and other intangibles primarily related to Dr. Jart+, reflecting forecast for slower-than-expected growth in China and travel retail. We continue to believe in the growth potential of the brand, which has been impacted by the temporary COVID disruptions in Asia given its strong growth prior to the start of the pandemic as well as the growth seen in recovering markets. For the 9 months, we generated $1.97 billion in net cash flows from operating activities compared to $2.78 billion last year, which reflects investments in working capital to both support growth and mitigate some of the risk of supply chain disruptions as well as higher cash paid for taxes. This was partially offset by higher net income. We significantly increased our capital investment to $658 million to support the ongoing construction of our new manufacturing facility near Tokyo. Investments in our innovation center in Shanghai as well as investments in online and technology enhancements. And we returned $2.62 billion in cash to stockholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Turning now to our outlook. As you have heard and are aware, there have been two significant headwinds that have emerged since we last gave guidance in early February, increased COVID-related restrictions in China also impacting Hainan and the invasion of Ukraine. Our current guidance for the balance of this year reflects continued momentum in the Americas and EMEA excluding travel retail as well as the continuation of lockdowns and corresponding distribution constraints in China through at least the first half of our fourth quarter. While we expect continued growth at retail in both Mainland China and Hainan, the severity of the distribution constraints we are experiencing are expected to result in a meaningful decline in net sales for these areas for the quarter. We are cautiously optimistic that we will be able to fulfill the majority of our orders in time for our planned 6.18 activities. The elimination of sales in Russia and Ukraine has reduced expected fourth quarter sales growth by approximately 120 basis points. At the same time, we delivered outstanding results for the first 9 months of the fiscal year, with greater diversification of our growth drivers. Our geographic diversity is a tremendous asset, and we expect our multiple engines of growth to continue, including the ongoing recovery of the Americas, Western Europe and most markets in Asia. We expect to also deliver strong margin improvement for the year. The benefit of our strategic pricing actions this year, along with agility and our cost management are helping to offset the initial effects of increasing inflation throughout this fiscal year. We plan to continue to invest in the recovery, support innovation and assuming current disruptions abate, fuel upcoming key shopping moments in the quarter, like 6.18 in China and Mother's Day. With these assumptions as our backdrop for the full fiscal year, organic net sales are now forecasted to grow 5% to 7%. This range excludes approximately 2 points from acquisitions, divestitures and brand closures, primarily the inclusion of DECIEM, and currency is forecasted to be neutral. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $7.05 and $7.15 before restructuring in other charges. This includes approximately $0.05 of accretion from currency translation and $0.02 dilution from DECIEM. In constant currency, we expect EPS to rise by 8% to 10%. These expectations imply margin expansion of approximately 70 basis points, including dilution of 40 basis points from DECIEM this year. In closing, we managed extremely well through an increasingly complex environment in our third quarter, and these complexities are expected to meaningfully impact our fourth quarter. Despite this, we continue to expect to deliver a very strong year with above-average organic top line growth, excellent margin expansion and solid EPS growth. We are confident that we can continue to manage through the present temporary headwinds and be well prepared for accelerated momentum when the pandemic effects ease. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time. So it depends really on the SKU, right? And we do have -- we've had disruptions now for the last several weeks as it relates to supply chain. We certainly have had inventory in trade. But to your point, we have had some difficulties certainly shipping product to consumers. So in some cases, it's taking longer than what it normally would. And in other cases, we haven't been able to ship at all. We believe that based on some of the things that we're hearing on the ground that the market might open up in mid-May, but it's very -- it's uncertain right now. So we obviously had to put our assumptions together as it relates to the fourth quarter. And our assumptions assume that things will start to open up in mid-May. And then there will be a catch-up. So we do have the product in and around China for 6.18. It's a matter of getting it to our distribution center and then obviously, getting it out to customers in time. Yes, Dara, so I'll start. There are two things going on in the fourth quarter that are impacting us. Given the pandemic management in China right now, there is also a slowdown in traffic to Hainan. And so travel retail is being impacted as well in the fourth quarter, specifically Hainan along with China. As you saw in the third quarter when traffic slowed in our distribution and online, we pulled back on expenses, and we would be prepared to do the same in the fourth quarter if our assumptions change. The other thing that we are looking to do is have a temporary distribution center outside of the area that is most affected and hopefully, we'll mitigate some of the pressure on our Shanghai campus. So those are a couple of the things that we're planning to do as our plan B, if you will, if the market does not open up in the middle of May. But we are encouraged by some recent signs that we've seen in terms of -- or heard in terms of some of the cases coming down. But it's quite volatile, Dara, so this is the best estimate that we have at this time of the situation and what we could deliver in Q4. So let me start, Andrea, with the pricing. My 400 basis points really was for the second half of the year. We started the year taking 3.5% of pricing increase. And typically, we take most of our pricing increases at the beginning of our fiscal year. We did take a second price increase in January. So the impact year-over-year for our second half is 4% pricing relative to prior year. And we expect to, in our upcoming -- the beginning of our upcoming fiscal year in July, take additional pricing. So -- and that pricing is strategic between levels within the tiers of our categories. So yes, skincare or higher-priced skincare might take higher price pricing, our lower-priced skin care would take lower price increases. It's very much dependent on the market, the currency, the inflation there's a very sophisticated model that we use to determine what pricing for our various brands. So yes, we will have lower skincare sales in the fourth quarter. But on average, the pricing increases that we've taken will still be around 4%, and we do expect that they would cover the inflation that we are experiencing at the moment. And the only thing I would add to that is even as we've commented, the fragrance category during this time has picked up, so to Fabrizio's point in terms of self tampering and prestige hair care. So we're actually seeing an acceleration in some categories of prestige during this time, particularly in the markets that are in recovery. So this really is a temporary situation that we're experiencing now and into the fourth quarter. Our team on the ground in China has been working diligently to try to get product to consumers, respecting obviously, the restrictions that are in place and staying healthy. And we are incredibly thankful to them for all of the things that they're doing to make sure that they can as best they can under these circumstances meet the demand of our consumers in China who really are looking for our products, and we'll get them as soon as we can get them to them so."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies Fiscal 2022 Second Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded and webcast. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Rainey Mancini.\nRainey Mancini: Hello. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements. To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges and adjustments disclosed in our press release. Unless otherwise stated, all net sales growth numbers are in constant currency, and all organic net sales growth excludes the non-comparable impacts of acquisitions, divestitures, brand closures and the impact of currency translation. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our press release and on the Investors section of our website. As a reminder, references to online sales include sales we make directly to our consumers through our brand.com sites and through third-party platforms and also includes estimated sales of our products through our retailers' websites. During the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question so that we can respond to all of you within the time scheduled for this call. And now, I will turn the call over to Fabrizio.\nFabrizio Freda: Thank you, Rainey, and hello, everyone. It is good to be with you today as our hearts continues to be with those impacted by COVID-19 around the world. We achieved record sales and profitability in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022. Our multiple engines of growth strategy showcased the benefit of its diversification. Every category, region and major channel expanded. We size the favorable dynamics of skin care, fragrance developed markets in the West, brick-and-mortar, and continue to prosper in the East with Chinese consumer as well as in global travel retail and global online. The flexibility we built into our business model over the last decade enable us to both allocate resources to attractive growth opportunities and effectively manage the impacts by increasing inflationary environment. Our advanced planning for the key shopping moments of 11.11 and holidays allowed us to overcome supply chain obstacles. For our second quarter, reported net sales grew 14%. Organic net sales rose 11%. Adjusted operating margin expanded, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 15%. Today's results are all the more impressive compared to the pre-pandemic second quarter of fiscal year 2020 when we delivered record organic sales growth in our seasonally largest quarter. Despite the ensuing challenges of COVID-19, which escalated during the quarter with Omicron, we far exceeded the exceptional results of two years ago. Reported sales are 20% higher driven by organic sales growth and with every region now larger, and we are much more profitable. Our gains during the last two years reinforced our confidence in our ability to navigate the impacts of the prolonged pandemic. Moreover, our optimist in the opportunities of tomorrow remains incredibly strong, owing to the timeless desirability of our brands and our commitment during the pandemic to invest for the near-and the long-term. Our brand portfolio of large, scaling and developing brands served as a powerful catalyst for growth as consumer reward the quality of our trusted brand and hero products. In the second quarter, 11 brands achieved double-digit organic sales growth versus the prior year period. This broad-based trend is similar to the contribution in the first quarter despite a far tougher comparison. The momentum in our largest brands, Clinique, Est\u00e9e Lauder, La Mer and M A C, continues as the hero franchises capitalize on innovation in product engagement and high-touch experiences and services to drive trial and repeat. La Mer and Clinique delivered standout results in skin care, while Est\u00e9e Lauder and M A C drove makeup emerging renaissance. Our scaling and developing brands achieved excellent results. Jo Malone London and Tom Ford Beauty led fragrance and were among our top-performing brands, while Bobbi Brown grew strongly driven by skin care. Aveda and Bumble and bumble delivered accelerating sales growth in hair care as Too Faced and Smashbox rose double digits in makeup. Product innovation also served as a powerful catalyst for growth across our brand portfolio, contributing nearly 25% of sales. This level of contribution is notable in a quarter when holidays exclusives represent a larger mix of business and especially so in a challenged supply chain environment. La Mer fueled by its iconic heros on trend holiday merchandising and highly sought new dehydrating infused emotion led the Company's sales growth. The brand excelled in every region and across major channels, cheered by its loyal consumer and embraced by new cohort of consumers, including more men. Clinique's skin care portfolio with its desirable innovation and hero franchises performed strongly. Its new Smart Clinical Retail Wrinkle Correcting Serum drove sales gains in North America, amplifying the brand's global momentum in the serum subcategory. Clinique Take The Day Off makeup remover saw a dramatic uptick in sales, evidence of makeup's emerging renaissance and the staying power of this crowd favorite skin care product, which is recruiting a new generation of consumers. For makeup, the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand is a driving force in the category emerging renaissance, with makeup sales for the brand already larger than two years ago. Est\u00e9e Lauder Double Wear hero franchise delivered remarkable performance, while its Futurist foundation, which is an East to West product born of skinification of makeup trend, was very strong. Our fragrance portfolio continued to go from strength to strength, owing to the enduring sand-based ritual created in the pandemic and enhanced by innovation. Better online storytelling and expanded reach as consumers in the East embrace this category. Each of Jo Malone London, Tom Ford Beauty, Le Labo, Kilian Paris and Frederic Malle delivered strong double-digit growth in every region, demonstrating the idea of these brands around the world. Tom Ford Beauty exemplifies the benefits of a strategic focus on heros and innovation. Its Ombre Leather Parfum had a halo effect on the Ombre Parfum such that sales for the franchise doubled. In the third quarter, the brand is leveraging its global appeal with the flare of local relevance in the fragrance launch of Tom Ford Trilogy. Our growth engines also continue to diversify by region as we anticipate. Developed markets in the West performed especially well. North America executed with excellence to capture brick-and-mortar reopening trends and deliver a strong holiday across channels. Festive seasonal exclusive, including Est\u00e9e Lauder blockbuster set and Aveda collaboration with Phillip Lim, proved highly sought. Indeed, our in-store and online activation and merchandising were incredibly successful, with brand.com posting a record Black Friday. Every category grew double digits organically in North America led by makeup where our brand paid trusted product with enticing innovation as social and professional user education increased. M\u00b7A\u00b7C, Bobbi Brown and Too Faced produce engaging content and artist-led education to inspire consumers to size the joy and creativity of the category. Mainland China delivered high single-digit organic sales growth, an impressive result given the regional restrictions in the quarter, the pressured brick-and-mortar and makeup. Online sales rose double digits organically, even after having posted significant growth in the year ago period. For 11.11 on Tmall, the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand ranked number one flagship store in beauty for the second consecutive year, as La Mer flagship store topped luxury beauty once more and Jo Malone London again led in prestige fragrance. On JD, the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand ranked number one flagship store in beauty in its first year. Skin care and fragrance grew double digits organically in Mainland China. Hero products and innovation excelled, driving new consumer acquisition and repeat purchases. Several brands expanded prestige beauty share in the quarter, including Est\u00e9e Lauder, La Mer and Dr. Jart+. Looking ahead, we are excited about the long-term growth opportunity in the vibrant Asia/Pacific region and, most notably, in China. We are a few months from opening our new innovation center in Shanghai. Our aspirations for it are bold as we aim to meet and exceed the desires of Chinese consumers. The center is designed to enable end-to-end innovation from concept, from product packaging through development, scale-up and commercialization. I am pleased to share that the build-out of our state-of-art manufacturing facility near Tokyo is also progressing very well, which is a testament to the amazing work of our global supply chain team amid the pandemic. Its first phase is complete, and we are on track to start limited production by the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. Our growth engines further diversified by channel as both online and brick-and-mortar prospered. Specialty-multi and department store contributed meaningfully, and freestanding store in the West performed very well on reopening. Traffic improved and complemented our strategic actions, including those under the post-COVID business acceleration program to benefit productivity in brick-and-mortar. This channel trends are encouraging for the long term, even if tempered in this moment by Omicron. We continued to expand our omnichannel capabilities in the quarter to give consumer flexible and convenient shopping options for greater certainly for fulfillment. Buy online, pickup in-store offerings in the United States for M\u00b7A\u00b7C, Aveda, Jo Malone London and Le Labo are driving favorable average order value trends, and we are expanding the capability to more doors internationally, which holds great promise for the future. Our global online channel delivered excellent performance, with organic sales rising high single digit after having surged over 50% in the year ago period. Each of brand.com, third-party platform, pure play and retail.com contributed to growth. The drivers included higher levels of engagement for virtual try-on and tools for choosing shade and scent sophisticated assembly to drive trial and repeat a more and better live streaming. Indeed, in North America, La Mer generated the most sales from a live stream to date in the quarter. Our brands are innovating in social commerce on Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok and WeChat, among others. We gained momentum in this promising online ecosystem during the quarter. Too Faced leveraged an Instagram live shopping event to launch its new fragrance. Est\u00e9e Lauder Double Wear followers on TikTok skyrocket with its latest campaign also driving brand awareness and affinity much higher. And Tom Ford Beauty creatively debuted its new flagship site on WeChat's mini program in China. Embedded with these outstanding results across categories, regions and channels is the progress we are making in social impact and sustainability. Since we spoke with you in November, we are pleased to have received several external recognitions of our ESG efforts. We were named to Forbes inaugural list identifying the world's top female-friendly companies, leading the way to support women inside and outside the workforces. And for the fifth year in a row, we were named to Bloomberg Gender Equality Index. We were included in the CDP's Climate A List for the second consecutive year, which is a tribute to our deep commitment to climate action and to the highest level of transparency around our environmental interest. Last, MSCI recognized our progress toward our 2025 ESG goal in its recent upgrade of the Company to an A rating. The Company, our brands and our employees have a number of events and activations planned in honor of Black History Month, and we are continuing to focus on our racial equity commitments and the work of accomplishing our goals. As we embarked in -- on the second half of our fiscal year, our innovation pipeline is reached with newness, especially for sustainability. La Mer newly advanced The Treatment Lotion, which will be on country in March as a powerful upgrade inside and out, crafted using our unique green score methodology and housed in a new recyclable glass bottle made with 20% post-consumer recycled glass. This methodology, which was peer-reviewed in academic journal, Green Chemistry, during the quarter, evaluate ingredients and formulas throughout the lenses of human health, ecosystem health and the environment. This approach can be adopted, built upon and scaled by others across our industry to further advance sustainability. Est\u00e9e Lauder is launching an all-new Revitalizing Supreme moisturizer created with innovations in formula and ingredients in a new recyclable glass jar -- bottle jar. Smashbox is introducing photo finished silkscreen primer collection fishery vegan formulas with a skin defending complex and instant makeup benefits. Lastly, DECIEM and BECCA brands, The Ordinary, is welcoming back salicylic acid 2% solution, boosting a win list of over 400,000 for the new formula. In closing, we delivered outstanding performance amid the accelerated volatility variability as well as supply chain challenges of the pandemic. This demonstrates that we have the competency to navigate complexity well. Our commitment to invest for the long term is of great importance in this moment as we benefit from the advancement we have made over the last few years in data analytics, technology, R&D and supply chain. These announced capabilities, combined with our strong portfolio of desirable brands, exceptional talent and more flexible resource allocation, are enabling us to realize the power of our multiple engines of growth strategy even in a difficult external environment. The grace, wisdom and ingenuity of our employee in this still challenging moment knows no bounds. They are the embodiment of our company's strong culture. And to them, I extend my deepest gratitude. I will now turn the call over to Tracey.\nTracey Travis: Thank you, Fabrizio, and hello, everyone. As you just heard, our momentum continued in our second quarter, with net sales growing 11% organically and 14% in total, led by a continued overall progression and recovery despite the volatility inherent across markets with a prolonged pandemic. We had a solid holiday performance across all of our regions. The inclusion of sales from the May 2021 DECIEM investment added approximately three points to reported net sales growth, and the currency impact was neutral. From a geographic standpoint, organic net sales in the Americas rose 19% as holiday shoppers' return to brick-and-mortar retail where we had an exciting array of gifting products and holiday activations in store. And even with more consumers' shopping in stores, organic sales online also grew solidly in the Americas, with online representing more than 1/3 of sales in the region. Every market in the region contributed to sales growth this quarter, and the inclusion of sales from DECIEM added approximately five points to the total reported sales growth in the region. In our Europe, the Middle East and Africa region, organic net sales rose 13%. Growth was diverse and broad-based, with global travel retail as well as every market contributing. All channels grew, led by double-digit growth across brick-and-mortar as recovery continued in both developed and emerging markets in the region. Despite a strong performance during key shopping moments, organic sales online declined slightly, primarily driven by the U.K. due to a tough comparison with the prior year, which was more severely impacted by brick-and-mortar lockdowns. The inclusion of sales from DECIEM added about three points to total reported sales growth in the region. Our global travel retail business grew low double digits. Travel restrictions have eased globally, and international passenger traffic continued to progressively improve, resulting in some stores reopening during the quarter, particularly in Europe and the Americas. Travel retail continues to be led by Asia/Pacific where demand from Chinese consumers remained strong. In our Asia/Pacific region, organic net sales rose 5%. Most of the markets in the region grew, led by Mainland China and Australia, although we continue to see variability in COVID restrictions and retail traffic across markets. Sales grew across most major channels in the region, especially online, which benefited from the recent launch of three brands on JD.com. The inclusion of sales from DECIEM added approximately one point to total reported sales growth in the region. From a category standpoint, organic net sales of fragrances grew 30% with double-digit increases across all regions. Exceptional double-digit increases from Jo Malone London, Tom Ford Beauty, Le Labo and Kilian Paris reflected strong performances from hero products, new product launches, and the continued growth of the Bath & Body and Home subcategories. Organic net sales in makeup rose 12% as consumers in the Americas and Europe responded to social media activation, holiday assortments and trends. Est\u00e9e Lauder foundations continue to resonate very strongly with consumers, especially those in the Double Wear and Futurist franchises. M\u00b7A\u00b7C continued to drive the makeup renaissance with engaging, interactive campaigns throughout the quarter, like the special M\u00b7A\u00b7C trend Halloween report and solid holiday collections. Too Faced, Tom Ford Beauty, Smashbox and Bobbi Brown also contributed to growth in the category this quarter. Organic net sales in skin care grew 7%, reflecting double-digit increases from La Mer, Clinique and Bobbi Brown. The inclusion of sales from DECIEM added four percentage points to reported growth. Our organic net sales in hair care rose 18% as traffic in salons and stores improved, primarily in the Americas. Aveda's growth came mostly from holiday gifts and hero franchises and in online and freestanding stores, while Bumble and bumble focused on recruiting new consumers in the specialty-multi channel. Our gross margin improved 20 basis points compared to last year. The benefits of strategic price increases and favorable currency more than offset the impact of higher makeup mix and lower gross margin on DECIEM products. Inflationary pressures in our supply chain are expected to begin to more prominently impact cost of goods in our fiscal third quarter. Operating expenses decreased 140 basis points as a percent of sales. Our leverage of selling expense and general and administrative expense was partially offset by increases in advertising and shipping costs, the latter due to both inflation and our direct-to-consumer online growth. Operating income rose 22% to $1.44 billion, and our operating margin expanded 160 basis points to 25.9% in the quarter. Our tax rate at 21.4% continued at a more normal level this year versus the prior year, which was impacted by a onetime benefit associated with GILTI. Diluted EPS of $3.01 increased 15% compared to the prior year. For the six months, we generated $1.85 billion in net cash flows from operating activities compared to $1.98 billion last year, which reflects both a return to more normalized working capital needs as well as increased inventory to mitigate some of the risk of supply chain disruption given the ongoing global macro challenges. We significantly increased our capital investment to $459 million to support the construction of our new production facility near Tokyo as well as investments in our online business and other technology enhancements. And we returned $1.84 billion in cash to stockholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends, with an increase in our dividend rate occurring in the second quarter. So turning now to our outlook, we delivered an exceptional first half characterized by strong and diversified double-digit organic sales growth and disciplined cost management in the context of intermittent COVID disruptions, including the rise of the Omicron variant, high inflation and volatility. Looking ahead, we are raising guidance to reflect our expectation for a strong year despite the potential further spread of Omicron, supply chain challenges and increased inflationary pressures. Inflation and transportation and procurement is expected to impact our cost of goods in the second half. However, the benefit of pricing and cost mitigation efforts are helping to offset some of the inflation impacts for the fiscal year. At this time, we expect pricing to add approximately 3.5 points of growth with the inclusion of the additional pricing actions we are taking during our second half. We are planning to support the continuation of the recovery with increased point-of-sale staffing as retail traffic continues to gradually improve. We are also planning to support key hero franchise launches in our third quarter from Est\u00e9e Lauder, La Mer and Origins with increased marketing and advertising support. This investment will increase cost towards the latter part of the third quarter with more of the benefit to be realized in the fourth quarter. For the full fiscal year, organic net sales are forecasted to grow 10% to 13%. Based on rates of 1.146 for the euro, 1.357 for the pound and 6.399 for the Chinese yuan, we expect currency translation to be negligible for the full year. This range excludes approximately three points from acquisitions, divestitures and brand closures, primarily the inclusion of DECIEM. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $7.43 and $7.58 before restructuring and other charges. This includes approximately $0.07 of accretion from currency translation and $0.03 of accretion from DECIEM. In constant currency, we expect EPS to rise by 14% to 17%. We expect organic sales for our third quarter to rise 8% to 10%. The net incremental sales from acquisitions, divestitures and brand closures are expected to add about three points to reported growth, and currency is forecasted to be negative by about one point. We expect third quarter EPS of $1.55 to $1.65. Currency is expected to be $0.01 accretive to EPS, and the inclusion of DECIEM is not expected to be material. In closing, our results thus far clearly demonstrate the power of our diversified portfolio. Temporary softness in our Eastern markets driven by the pandemic was again offset by renewed growth in our Western markets. A resulting slight slowing of growth in skin care was offset by remarkable growth in fragrances. We continue to be choiceful about where we invest, and the flexibility we have built into our cost structure is helping us to mitigate some of the COVID-related disruptions and inflation while allowing us to continue to invest appropriately in our future growth. This agility, along with the resilience of our remarkable teams worldwide, gives us confidence that we can continue to manage through the temporary complexities caused by the prolonged pandemic by focusing clearly on our long-term strategy and executing against it with excellence. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time.\nOperator: Thank you. The floor is now open for your questions. [Operator Instructions] To ensure that everyone can ask their question, we will limit each person to one question, time permitting, we will return you for additional questions. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: I was hoping to get an update on China. You mentioned the strong performance there from a brand perspective during the 11.11 holiday, but the category wasn't as robust as we've seen in past years in terms of growth. So -- and with also the lockdown situation there. So any perspective on category growth in China in calendar Q4 and what you're seeing so far in calendar Q1 of this year would be helpful and risk from lockdowns? And maybe while you're on the subject, just longer term, touch on the growth curve of China in terms of per capita consumption development over time and your thoughts there?\nFabrizio Freda: Yes. No. Sure. So we achieved a high single-digit growth in Mainland China this quarter, and where brick-and-mortar channels were impacted by COVID restrictions. But however, our online, which was not impacted by closures, grew double digits in quarter two and represented more than half of our business in China. Additionally, our business in China, travel retail, grew rapidly as well as retail. So, we had four years of exceptional double-digit growth in China every quarter, and we expect this strong trend to have the potential to continue, frankly. And what you see in quarter two is just one specific segment, the brick-and-mortar, that affected by COVID restrictions went to single-digit growth, but the rest was all double-digit growth. So we remain absolutely excited by the potential of China. The long-term fundamentals that you were referring to in your question of the market remained really intact. There is the growing middle class continues to develop. The increasing per capita spending continues, at least in all the data we see on our products. And what the agility for us to serve the Chinese consumers wherever they buy, meaning online, travel retail, brick-and-mortar we are improving in all these elements. We are increasing the number of cities where we have brick-and-mortar. We are increasing the coverage online. You heard in the prepared remarks, our reference to JD and the incredible success in JD where Est\u00e9e Lauder is already number one shop in there, and the travel retail, where we continue to be very strong. Super excited by Hainan and the huge quality expression of our brands that is happening there. So very strong Chinese consumers trends and looking great, great future.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Peter Grom with UBS.\nPeter Grom: So I just wanted to ask about the operating expense leverage we have seen year-to-date. It's just -- when I take a step back and look at the first half of this year and compare it to pre-COVID levels, it's just been very impressive what you've been able to do there. And I know there's a mix benefit, sales leverage, cost savings, and obviously, costs that have yet to fully returned to pre-pandemic levels. But is there a way to help us frame how we should think about operating leverage longer term? Is there a way to kind of disaggregate the benefit you've seen year-to-date that you believe has greater staying power versus what you might expect to really come back as we return to, I guess, \"a normal environment?\"\nTracey Travis: Yes. Thanks Peter. In terms of the operating leverage that we've seen thus far, it has been terrific, obviously, in the first half. One of the things to keep in mind is our launch cadence in terms of when we actually have big product launches does affect quarter-to-quarter performance. But we certainly have continued to see some of the benefits of cost not returning. But brick-and-mortar is picking up. And clearly, we're continuing to ramp up in the third and fourth quarter, our selling staff to support greater brick-and-mortar sales. So when you look at our full year, the overall margin expansion that is included in our guidance is around 90 basis points. So well ahead of our guidance in terms of 50 basis points a year from a long-term perspective. And that includes not only some of the costs not fully returning, but also includes some of the incremental costs related to managing this pandemic, some of the safety procedures we've had in place, some of the additional testing that we have in place, et cetera, that we are incurring. But we certainly expect continued growth from our higher margin channels and categories in the future that will continue to benefit us going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: I wanted to chat a little bit about the Americas and growth that you've seen in particular in North America outside of kind of COVID-related recovery. And here, I'm thinking about some of the expanded distribution or consumer reach you describe it, particularly the expansion of Ulta and Sephora doors into significantly new locations. So curious kind of what you're seeing in terms of how your brands are performing generally in those locations and what you're seeing in terms of maybe new consumers coming into those franchises, again, as you think about that expanded consumer reach and your overall footprint broadening out?\nFabrizio Freda: So let me start from that. First of all, we see our brands doing well in these new distributions. And again, these new distributions, particularly the target Ulta, the cool Sephora you are referring to, were designed to get new consumers, particularly sourcing consumers from us. And we see this working and our initial projections continue to be strong. However, I want to clarify that in quarter two, a very small percentage of our growth was coming from those already. It's just the beginning. So the larger majority of our growth in quarter two was coming from just other organic activities that we are doing in the region. For example, we are strengthening and diversifying our product categories. Again, makeup renaissance is really getting also into new user education. So there are some fundamentals, which are improving for the post-COVID. Then we are gaining share in many on the categories, subcategories, for example, Tom Ford, Jo Malone was doing outstanding. The skin care gained share. The Ordinary is an important part of building our overall market share in the region. And the other thing I could mention is our innovation and our marketing progress has been super strong. And the distribution choices that we have done has increased our abilities to source new consumers. But apart from the new brick-and-mortar choices, the online progress in North America is bringing a lot of new consumers, particularly consumers that before were not shopping online, and now they're shopping omnichannel. And that's why our omnichannel progress in North America is also playing a strong growth to sustain our growth now in the long term and continue sourcing new consumers. And finally, we are really executing with excellence. We are reinvesting fast in rebuilding the stores in their [core] way. We are investing, in fact, in improving our execution online, as we discussed also in previous calls. And so this combination of investing, but at the same time, thanks to our restructuring program, we are increasing productivity to brick-and-mortar as brick-and-mortar continues, we are making also our ability to leverage the growth in North America much stronger than what it was before. And that's why North America is not only successful, not only recovering strongly from the COVID, but also becoming a powerful engine of growth for the long term in this model of strategy, I should say, of multiple engine of growth.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is going to come from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: My question is regarding EMEA ex-travel. So I was hoping to see -- if, Fabrizio, you can discuss a bit of that scenario. Unfortunately, Omicron was first seen in the U.K. And as you exit the quarter, how Continental Europe has been and the U.K. has been performing. And then as a follow-up, I think, Tracey, you mentioned -- and I appreciate the bridge for the margin front in the third quarter. I think you explained that the timing of some of the hiring of bricks and mortar and also some market launches in waiting on the market spend. Can you give us some perspective if this is a result of this timing and then we should see again operating -- the operating leverage, as you pointed out, 90 basis points for the year as you go into the fourth quarter?\nFabrizio Freda: Yes. I'll start from the -- if I understand your question was on travel and travel retail.\nTracey Travis: No. Ex-travel retail. EMEA ex-travel retail.\nFabrizio Freda: EMEA, ex-travel retail. Sorry, I didn't hear. EMEA ex-travel retail was very strong, and we saw good progress in many markets. And also in EMEA, the big acceleration is coming from online across every single country. So, very exciting progress with all brands -- good progress also in EMEA, there are emerging markets, which are doing very well, like India, the Middle East, Russia. And so, overall EMEA is again strong engines of growth that is being built over this year and now in the post-COVID acceleration is proving its role of building strong engines of growth, so all very strong. Tracey?\nTracey Travis: Yes. And in terms of the margin, we still, in the second quarter, did have quite a few open positions as it relates to our selling staff and certainly hope to be able to close that gap in the third and the fourth quarter. The big difference in the second half of the year is we will be spending more advertising as a percent of sales in the second half of the year to support the launches that we mentioned in the prepared remarks. And that will certainly impact particularly in Q3 the margin, and we expect to see the benefit of that in Q4, but really beyond. I mean these are our largest skin care brands, particularly Est\u00e9e Lauder and La Mer and the hero franchise reformulations that we are doing on some of the products are really quite significant for us going forward. So that also should help the skin care category grow a bit. But again, skin care is largely affected by some of the shutdowns in high concentration skin care markets like the Asia/Pacific market. So certainly, as that market picks up, we expect that skin care will pick up as well. That, too, I would attribute to more of a temporary slowdown than anything else.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo.\nChris Carey: On the travel retail business, the low double-digit growth, again, keep the division growing, which is great to see. And you noted that APAC continues to drive growth, I think you said with the China travel retail growing rapidly. I guess I'm just trying to balance the strength that you're seeing in China travel retail with -- I think there was a comment in the press release just around Hainan traffic being impacted by restrictions. And so can you maybe just dimensionalize strong growth from the Chinese consumer and travel retail with Hainan travel being negatively impacted with the strength that you're seeing there? And then, I guess, just bigger picture on this broader channels, just how this is developing in Asia, right? I think there's been a view that Mainland China and Japan and Korea can continue to deliver really strong growth just even as the Chinese travel retail business becomes so much bigger, and I'm just curious your latest thoughts on that.\nTracey Travis: Well, let me start with the -- your question on what we called out in terms of some of the disruptions that occurred in Hainan relative to the strong low double-digit growth that we had in travel retail. For the first quarter, actually, we had greater double-digit growth in travel retail. And so when you look at the first quarter versus the second quarter, while it was double digit, it was a bit less than in the first quarter, and that was a direct impact from the restrictions that occurred within China that impacted Hainan. We don't expect that level in the balance of the year. So we do expect to see travel retail pick up in the balance of the year. So Hainan continues to be a very strong driver of our travel retail business. And it is incredibly luxurious, and I know Fabrizio likes to talk about Hainan. So I will let him expand on that as well. But we continue to expand our presence in Hainan and continue to see fantastic, fantastic consumer receptivity to our brands in Hainan.\nFabrizio Freda: Yes. So to speak to the travel retail trends. First of all, the travel retail globally was strong and was accelerating versus the previous quarter. And yes, the -- in Asia, there were some elements of acceleration. Yes, Hainan was very strong, as Tracey was saying, but I want also to underline that there was a strong growth in EMEA and North America, as I think Tracey said during her prepared remarks as well, which was linked to more traffic during holidays in these regions despite the Omicron variant growth. Now this is a very important sign because the reactivity of travel retail sales to traffic increase is extraordinary. And we have seen this in EMEA, for example, during the last quarter, quarter two. So the first good news is the where traffic increase, travel retail respond very, very fast. And the other good news is what Tracey was speaking about the overall retail growth across despite some of the closures and some of the restrictions. The -- on Hainan, Hainan is becoming an extraordinary place, luxury, with amazing experiences. So it's probably one of the channels around the world, which is more equity building for the brand. So that's an important thing to underline. Also, in Hainan, there are many new retailers, which are opening. And so in Hainan, there is more distribution being built in several retailers, which are investing in the island. That's also something that will generate and will continue to generate expansion growth over time.\nTracey Travis: And regarding your question on travel outside of China, once travel restrictions are lifted, we certainly expect people to start traveling back to Japan and Korea and Thailand and other travel destinations for vacation as well as for business. So we certainly expect that those travel retail corridors will continue to recover similarly to what we've seen the start of in EMEA and the Americas, although traffic is still well behind, obviously, pre-pandemic levels. So, more growth to come as it relates to travel retail.\nFabrizio Freda: Yes. And maybe one thing on that, to add, Tracey, is the clarification, when the growth of international travel will restart. This will be only moderately cannibalizing anything like Hainan or domestic travel because remember that the external travel is only for people with passports. And there is a relatively small percentage that people in Asia has a passport to travel internationally. Well, Hainan is domestic travel. It is open to the entire population. So the -- when international travel will restart, this will be almost all net extra.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Callum Elliott with Bernstein.\nCallum Elliott: Fabrizio, we've seen a lot of leadership changes in the past few months right at the top of the business with, I think, both Chris, Hope and Cedric Prouve stepping down. And I think you've also made some structural changes with, I think, join our reporting straight to Peter at International rather than into Asia/Pacific sort of elevating the importance of the Mainland China business. So just hoping that you can talk a little bit about some of the structural and leadership changes as well as maybe the culture of the business and how that's changed since 2009 in the context of how should we think about leadership transition risk and how that's evolving.\nFabrizio Freda: Yes. By the way, this is a great question, and I admire the knowledge you have of our amazing talented team. So thank you for the question. And so what you're seeing actually is the reflection of our culture. What you're seeing is some organization changes, reflecting the shape of the business, particularly the elevation of China to be an independent region, given the importance of this region and the need of coordination with travel retail with the other key part of the Company, including online. And so that's an important next step that will make our ability to work with China and our ability of our China team to get support for grow the capabilities increased. So, the organization is basically increasing our power of execution in China, the change -- the organization changes. In terms of the changes of senior leadership, they are all well planned retirement plans. The culture of the Company is that our leaders share with us their plans in advance. We plan this with time and in a very professional way. And the very good news is that we have extraordinary succession plans already in place because all the succession of this position has been managed mostly with people that were ready for taking this position that were trained for years to take this position. So, I think you should take out of this the strength of our succession planning. That is also the reflection of our culture. And the culture is more and more collaborative cultures, which is united by our compass work, by our strategy work and our execution. Collaborative execution is the result of very clear common goals and very uniting reward systems to make this organization working team. And this has been -- since 2009 to today is progressing step-by-step gradually. I think today, we are a well-oiled organization at the top.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Olivia Tong with Raymond James.\nOlivia Tong: I wanted to ask you a little bit about brand support and promotion as we've obviously been hearing more and more about the cost to compete, particularly around key events like 11.11 in China, more promotions, deeper discounts, live streaming deals, cost of influences, things like that. So can you talk about how the market is evolving and your view on the investment spending necessary to team Asia, even if you could give an idea, it's kind of funny to ask, but an idea of magnitude of volume versus price contribution perhaps in Asia? And then sort of part and parcel with that, if you could just sort of put the Q3 versus second half guidance in context. The margin deceleration is fairly dramatic. That's implied in Q3, but a big bounce back in Q4. I get -- being prudent. I get that you mentioned little bit ad step-up, but just -- it seems like you feel relatively optimistic about the future. So just if you could provide some context around that that would be fantastic? Thanks so much. I appreciate it.\nTracey Travis: Okay. Well, in terms of 11.11, yes, certainly, 11.11 continues to be -- to get more and more competitive. And we've spoken in the past about how we do promotion as it relates to 11.11. A lot of it is done with samples. And certainly, increasingly, there is more and more media support for 11.11 as well. It is a big opportunity for us as we view it to recruit new consumers, and it is one of the biggest events that we have during the course of the year to -- in a concentrated period of time, have the ability to recruit new consumers, which then we retain work -- to retain over the balance of the future years. So media costs have gone, for sure. Live streaming activity has gone up, for sure. And we have shifted and adjusted our activity to make sure that our brands perform well within that environment. So it's a big planning event for the organization. We're really pleased with how our brands performed in general during 11.11 and have already started planning for next year's 11.11, which -- that's how long in advance we have to plan for it. So as it relates to the cadence of Q3 and Q4, we have spoken -- Olivia, I know you know for many years about the fact that we focus on the year. And we guide quarter-to-quarter, but we focus on managing the year. And in any given year, we might have very large product launches in the first quarter, or in the case of this year, in the third quarter. And so we do feel very positive about the future, obviously. And it is a rebalancing, to your point, between the third quarter and the fourth quarter. The other thing that is embedded in our guidance for the third quarter, quite honestly, is the fact that Omicron is still impacting brick-and-mortar. We also have beauty of weather here in New York. But Omicron is impacting the environment and in brick-and-mortar. So we are seeing a slower recovery in the third quarter for brick-and-mortar than certainly we saw just a few months ago. And so we are cautious as it relates to that. And then I did mention that we do have a step up in -- continued step-up in some of our shipping costs and some of our supply chain costs as well. We have taken pricing. So the second half of the year, our pricing increase is 4%, it was 3% in the first half of the year since, hence, the average of 3.5%, which I spoke about in my prepared remarks. And we know we have agility going forward if this environment continues to take additional pricing as it warrants. But the combination of pricing and cost savings are really what allows us to invest for long-term sustainable growth in things like a new innovation center in Shanghai, the new plant that we are investing in, in Japan as well as the investments we're making and the other capabilities that Fabrizio spoke about and deliver a very, very strong year in terms of double-digit top line growth and 90 basis points of margin expansion.\nFabrizio Freda: Yes. And if I can just underline one thing that Tracey has explained is that is really between quarter three and quarter four is rebalance. We are taking up the year and we believe in the strength of the year. And if you look at our fiscal year estimate is our guidance is going to be a very strong year. And it's going to be a very strong quarter four in this year. The quarter three, we have three big, big launches where we have investment in quarter three and the benefits in quarter four. And that's the important thing. And then the price increases that we are accelerating as of January, February in certain regions, as Tracey explained, have the biggest impact, the full impact in quarter four. And so that's the rebalance we are doing. But in total, we are going to deliver -- we are guiding a very strong year and a strong quarter four, and we are confident on it.\nTracey Travis: And because I know our brands are listening, so we do have three big skin care launches in the third quarter, but we do have makeup, fragrance and hair care launches as well that we are supporting.\nOperator: And we do have time for one final question. And our last question that we'll take today will come from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi.\nWendy Nicholson: I'm hoping I can sneak two in because I think what's kind of making folks nervous is the slowdown in travel retail. So can you just speak to your confidence? I mean, obviously, consumers are still managing to get their skin care product and their fragrance and whatnot. They're just shopping more online. So is there any concern that you have that sort of longer term, travel retail is going to be less of a buoyant channel for you? Maybe there's just been a shift in consumer behavior? Or how confident are you that when people start traveling again, that travel retail channel is going to really accelerate? And then I don't think you commented specifically, and it goes back to Dara's question, I think, on the China promotional environment. Again, that's something that we've heard from other players out there that maybe Est\u00e9e in particular has been exceptionally promotional in China. Can you just comment on that and sort of give us your take on that?\nFabrizio Freda: Yes. First of all, we are not promotional in China Mainland. Actually, the majority of our activities are sampling rather than pricing promotions. So if for promotional we mean that we have increased our sampling, our products that we give as a gift when -- that's our promotional model. Yes, we have been -- obviously, in 11.11 during the quarter, we have done the promotional needed to succeed in that event. And I think...\nTracey Travis: And Wendy, just realize that retailers with the slowdown in brick-and-mortar are also promotional. And so they are using promotion to drive traffic. So when we have seen -- and we saw a bit of this as well in the U.S. market when brick-and-mortar slowed down that some of the retail activity was quite promotional. So that is clearly a retailer-driven decision.\nFabrizio Freda: Yes. Thank you, Tracey, to clarify that retailers rising a promotion, they decide. We don't decide. But our promotion, as I was saying, is a lot about sampling and creating trial opportunities. So it's expensive rather than pricing. And then obviously, the retailers do what they believe is right for them in a given environment. The -- your question on travel retail, I think I have extreme high expectation for the long-term quality of travel retail growth. I think this is extremely promising channel. We have just seen the beginning of what will be a long-term powerful channel expansion for travel retail. And I spoke to these several other times. There are two drivers of travel retail, which are very important. One is the, obviously, the amount of travelers and what happens to travel, so the traffic. But the other is the conversion. So the amount of travelers that become shoppers. And the conversion of travelers into shoppers has been pre-COVID was still in the 10%, 15%, depending by region. So, enormous expansion possibility of conversion are still in front of us. And the arrival of online in travel retail, which we call pretail today is very strong in Asia, but just the very, very beginning in any other region of the world. This is, we know, is a huge conversion driver because where this happened, we saw conversions of travelers into shoppers go from the 10%, 15% into the 30s. So you can imagine over time with expansion of the online possibility to buy pretail that conversion will dramatically grow around the world of travel retail. When you have this perspective, the fact that the domestic duty free Hainan thing is going to be not cannibalized a lot when international travel will restart, as I explained, in the previous answer. And so, that the international traffic will come back. A lot of it will be net extra. And when you have in front of us, the prove that I was quoting before then where, for example, in EMEA, we have seen some new -- some traffic coming back during the recent holidays, we saw great sales recovery. And so the responsiveness of travel retail to traffic coming back is very, very high. And so when you combine all these considerations and you put on top of it that we have a great travel retail team, not only with extraordinary commercial capabilities, but with great marketing capability, that the traveling stores -- the stores for travelers are becoming more and more an important driver for everything we do, a super important equity building opportunity for the brands. And so they're becoming an integral part of the creation of the overall consumer experience and the trial repeat dynamic that we've built. So, I hope you realize why we do believe in travel retail as a long-term strategic channel.\nTracey Travis: And again, I think we feel very good. When you look at this quarter, the results that we achieved, travel retail had a great quarter, as we said, low double-digit growth, but the overall company grew at 14%. So, the diversified engines of growth that we have, really gives us the flexibility to continue to deliver overall against our expectations and grow our consumers and grow our profits.\nOperator: Thank you.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Fabrizio Freda",
            "content": "Thank you, Rainey, and hello, everyone. It is good to be with you today as our hearts continues to be with those impacted by COVID-19 around the world. We achieved record sales and profitability in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022. Our multiple engines of growth strategy showcased the benefit of its diversification. Every category, region and major channel expanded. We size the favorable dynamics of skin care, fragrance developed markets in the West, brick-and-mortar, and continue to prosper in the East with Chinese consumer as well as in global travel retail and global online. The flexibility we built into our business model over the last decade enable us to both allocate resources to attractive growth opportunities and effectively manage the impacts by increasing inflationary environment. Our advanced planning for the key shopping moments of 11.11 and holidays allowed us to overcome supply chain obstacles. For our second quarter, reported net sales grew 14%. Organic net sales rose 11%. Adjusted operating margin expanded, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 15%. Today's results are all the more impressive compared to the pre-pandemic second quarter of fiscal year 2020 when we delivered record organic sales growth in our seasonally largest quarter. Despite the ensuing challenges of COVID-19, which escalated during the quarter with Omicron, we far exceeded the exceptional results of two years ago. Reported sales are 20% higher driven by organic sales growth and with every region now larger, and we are much more profitable. Our gains during the last two years reinforced our confidence in our ability to navigate the impacts of the prolonged pandemic. Moreover, our optimist in the opportunities of tomorrow remains incredibly strong, owing to the timeless desirability of our brands and our commitment during the pandemic to invest for the near-and the long-term. Our brand portfolio of large, scaling and developing brands served as a powerful catalyst for growth as consumer reward the quality of our trusted brand and hero products. In the second quarter, 11 brands achieved double-digit organic sales growth versus the prior year period. This broad-based trend is similar to the contribution in the first quarter despite a far tougher comparison. The momentum in our largest brands, Clinique, Este\u0301e Lauder, La Mer and M A C, continues as the hero franchises capitalize on innovation in product engagement and high-touch experiences and services to drive trial and repeat. La Mer and Clinique delivered standout results in skin care, while Este\u0301e Lauder and M A C drove makeup emerging renaissance. Our scaling and developing brands achieved excellent results. Jo Malone London and Tom Ford Beauty led fragrance and were among our top-performing brands, while Bobbi Brown grew strongly driven by skin care. Aveda and Bumble and bumble delivered accelerating sales growth in hair care as Too Faced and Smashbox rose double digits in makeup. Product innovation also served as a powerful catalyst for growth across our brand portfolio, contributing nearly 25% of sales. This level of contribution is notable in a quarter when holidays exclusives represent a larger mix of business and especially so in a challenged supply chain environment. La Mer fueled by its iconic heros on trend holiday merchandising and highly sought new dehydrating infused emotion led the Company's sales growth. The brand excelled in every region and across major channels, cheered by its loyal consumer and embraced by new cohort of consumers, including more men. Clinique's skin care portfolio with its desirable innovation and hero franchises performed strongly. Its new Smart Clinical Retail Wrinkle Correcting Serum drove sales gains in North America, amplifying the brand's global momentum in the serum subcategory. Clinique Take The Day Off makeup remover saw a dramatic uptick in sales, evidence of makeup's emerging renaissance and the staying power of this crowd favorite skin care product, which is recruiting a new generation of consumers. For makeup, the Este\u0301e Lauder brand is a driving force in the category emerging renaissance, with makeup sales for the brand already larger than two years ago. Este\u0301e Lauder Double Wear hero franchise delivered remarkable performance, while its Futurist foundation, which is an East to West product born of skinification of makeup trend, was very strong. Our fragrance portfolio continued to go from strength to strength, owing to the enduring sand-based ritual created in the pandemic and enhanced by innovation. Better online storytelling and expanded reach as consumers in the East embrace this category. Each of Jo Malone London, Tom Ford Beauty, Le Labo, Kilian Paris and Frederic Malle delivered strong double-digit growth in every region, demonstrating the idea of these brands around the world. Tom Ford Beauty exemplifies the benefits of a strategic focus on heros and innovation. Its Ombre Leather Parfum had a halo effect on the Ombre Parfum such that sales for the franchise doubled. In the third quarter, the brand is leveraging its global appeal with the flare of local relevance in the fragrance launch of Tom Ford Trilogy. Our growth engines also continue to diversify by region as we anticipate. Developed markets in the West performed especially well. North America executed with excellence to capture brick-and-mortar reopening trends and deliver a strong holiday across channels. Festive seasonal exclusive, including Este\u0301e Lauder blockbuster set and Aveda collaboration with Phillip Lim, proved highly sought. Indeed, our in-store and online activation and merchandising were incredibly successful, with brand.com posting a record Black Friday. Every category grew double digits organically in North America led by makeup where our brand paid trusted product with enticing innovation as social and professional user education increased. M\u00b7A\u00b7C, Bobbi Brown and Too Faced produce engaging content and artist-led education to inspire consumers to size the joy and creativity of the category. Mainland China delivered high single-digit organic sales growth, an impressive result given the regional restrictions in the quarter, the pressured brick-and-mortar and makeup. Online sales rose double digits organically, even after having posted significant growth in the year ago period. For 11.11 on Tmall, the Este\u0301e Lauder brand ranked number one flagship store in beauty for the second consecutive year, as La Mer flagship store topped luxury beauty once more and Jo Malone London again led in prestige fragrance. On JD, the Este\u0301e Lauder brand ranked number one flagship store in beauty in its first year. Skin care and fragrance grew double digits organically in Mainland China. Hero products and innovation excelled, driving new consumer acquisition and repeat purchases. Several brands expanded prestige beauty share in the quarter, including Este\u0301e Lauder, La Mer and Dr. Jart+. Looking ahead, we are excited about the long-term growth opportunity in the vibrant Asia/Pacific region and, most notably, in China. We are a few months from opening our new innovation center in Shanghai. Our aspirations for it are bold as we aim to meet and exceed the desires of Chinese consumers. The center is designed to enable end-to-end innovation from concept, from product packaging through development, scale-up and commercialization. I am pleased to share that the build-out of our state-of-art manufacturing facility near Tokyo is also progressing very well, which is a testament to the amazing work of our global supply chain team amid the pandemic. Its first phase is complete, and we are on track to start limited production by the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. Our growth engines further diversified by channel as both online and brick-and-mortar prospered. Specialty-multi and department store contributed meaningfully, and freestanding store in the West performed very well on reopening. Traffic improved and complemented our strategic actions, including those under the post-COVID business acceleration program to benefit productivity in brick-and-mortar. This channel trends are encouraging for the long term, even if tempered in this moment by Omicron. We continued to expand our omnichannel capabilities in the quarter to give consumer flexible and convenient shopping options for greater certainly for fulfillment. Buy online, pickup in-store offerings in the United States for M\u00b7A\u00b7C, Aveda, Jo Malone London and Le Labo are driving favorable average order value trends, and we are expanding the capability to more doors internationally, which holds great promise for the future. Our global online channel delivered excellent performance, with organic sales rising high single digit after having surged over 50% in the year ago period. Each of brand.com, third-party platform, pure play and retail.com contributed to growth. The drivers included higher levels of engagement for virtual try-on and tools for choosing shade and scent sophisticated assembly to drive trial and repeat a more and better live streaming. Indeed, in North America, La Mer generated the most sales from a live stream to date in the quarter. Our brands are innovating in social commerce on Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok and WeChat, among others. We gained momentum in this promising online ecosystem during the quarter. Too Faced leveraged an Instagram live shopping event to launch its new fragrance. Este\u0301e Lauder Double Wear followers on TikTok skyrocket with its latest campaign also driving brand awareness and affinity much higher. And Tom Ford Beauty creatively debuted its new flagship site on WeChat's mini program in China. Embedded with these outstanding results across categories, regions and channels is the progress we are making in social impact and sustainability. Since we spoke with you in November, we are pleased to have received several external recognitions of our ESG efforts. We were named to Forbes inaugural list identifying the world's top female-friendly companies, leading the way to support women inside and outside the workforces. And for the fifth year in a row, we were named to Bloomberg Gender Equality Index. We were included in the CDP's Climate A List for the second consecutive year, which is a tribute to our deep commitment to climate action and to the highest level of transparency around our environmental interest. Last, MSCI recognized our progress toward our 2025 ESG goal in its recent upgrade of the Company to an A rating. The Company, our brands and our employees have a number of events and activations planned in honor of Black History Month, and we are continuing to focus on our racial equity commitments and the work of accomplishing our goals. As we embarked in -- on the second half of our fiscal year, our innovation pipeline is reached with newness, especially for sustainability. La Mer newly advanced The Treatment Lotion, which will be on country in March as a powerful upgrade inside and out, crafted using our unique green score methodology and housed in a new recyclable glass bottle made with 20% post-consumer recycled glass. This methodology, which was peer-reviewed in academic journal, Green Chemistry, during the quarter, evaluate ingredients and formulas throughout the lenses of human health, ecosystem health and the environment. This approach can be adopted, built upon and scaled by others across our industry to further advance sustainability. Este\u0301e Lauder is launching an all-new Revitalizing Supreme moisturizer created with innovations in formula and ingredients in a new recyclable glass jar -- bottle jar. Smashbox is introducing photo finished silkscreen primer collection fishery vegan formulas with a skin defending complex and instant makeup benefits. Lastly, DECIEM and BECCA brands, The Ordinary, is welcoming back salicylic acid 2% solution, boosting a win list of over 400,000 for the new formula. In closing, we delivered outstanding performance amid the accelerated volatility variability as well as supply chain challenges of the pandemic. This demonstrates that we have the competency to navigate complexity well. Our commitment to invest for the long term is of great importance in this moment as we benefit from the advancement we have made over the last few years in data analytics, technology, R&D and supply chain. These announced capabilities, combined with our strong portfolio of desirable brands, exceptional talent and more flexible resource allocation, are enabling us to realize the power of our multiple engines of growth strategy even in a difficult external environment. The grace, wisdom and ingenuity of our employee in this still challenging moment knows no bounds. They are the embodiment of our company's strong culture. And to them, I extend my deepest gratitude. I will now turn the call over to Tracey. Yes. No. Sure. So we achieved a high single-digit growth in Mainland China this quarter, and where brick-and-mortar channels were impacted by COVID restrictions. But however, our online, which was not impacted by closures, grew double digits in quarter two and represented more than half of our business in China. Additionally, our business in China, travel retail, grew rapidly as well as retail. So, we had four years of exceptional double-digit growth in China every quarter, and we expect this strong trend to have the potential to continue, frankly. And what you see in quarter two is just one specific segment, the brick-and-mortar, that affected by COVID restrictions went to single-digit growth, but the rest was all double-digit growth. So we remain absolutely excited by the potential of China. The long-term fundamentals that you were referring to in your question of the market remained really intact. There is the growing middle class continues to develop. The increasing per capita spending continues, at least in all the data we see on our products. And what the agility for us to serve the Chinese consumers wherever they buy, meaning online, travel retail, brick-and-mortar we are improving in all these elements. We are increasing the number of cities where we have brick-and-mortar. We are increasing the coverage online. You heard in the prepared remarks, our reference to JD and the incredible success in JD where Este\u0301e Lauder is already number one shop in there, and the travel retail, where we continue to be very strong. Super excited by Hainan and the huge quality expression of our brands that is happening there. So very strong Chinese consumers trends and looking great, great future. So let me start from that. First of all, we see our brands doing well in these new distributions. And again, these new distributions, particularly the target Ulta, the cool Sephora you are referring to, were designed to get new consumers, particularly sourcing consumers from us. And we see this working and our initial projections continue to be strong. However, I want to clarify that in quarter two, a very small percentage of our growth was coming from those already. It's just the beginning. So the larger majority of our growth in quarter two was coming from just other organic activities that we are doing in the region. For example, we are strengthening and diversifying our product categories. Again, makeup renaissance is really getting also into new user education. So there are some fundamentals, which are improving for the post-COVID. Then we are gaining share in many on the categories, subcategories, for example, Tom Ford, Jo Malone was doing outstanding. The skin care gained share. The Ordinary is an important part of building our overall market share in the region. And the other thing I could mention is our innovation and our marketing progress has been super strong. And the distribution choices that we have done has increased our abilities to source new consumers. But apart from the new brick-and-mortar choices, the online progress in North America is bringing a lot of new consumers, particularly consumers that before were not shopping online, and now they're shopping omnichannel. And that's why our omnichannel progress in North America is also playing a strong growth to sustain our growth now in the long term and continue sourcing new consumers. And finally, we are really executing with excellence. We are reinvesting fast in rebuilding the stores in their [core] way. We are investing, in fact, in improving our execution online, as we discussed also in previous calls. And so this combination of investing, but at the same time, thanks to our restructuring program, we are increasing productivity to brick-and-mortar as brick-and-mortar continues, we are making also our ability to leverage the growth in North America much stronger than what it was before. And that's why North America is not only successful, not only recovering strongly from the COVID, but also becoming a powerful engine of growth for the long term in this model of strategy, I should say, of multiple engine of growth. Yes. I'll start from the -- if I understand your question was on travel and travel retail. EMEA, ex-travel retail. Sorry, I didn't hear. EMEA ex-travel retail was very strong, and we saw good progress in many markets. And also in EMEA, the big acceleration is coming from online across every single country. So, very exciting progress with all brands -- good progress also in EMEA, there are emerging markets, which are doing very well, like India, the Middle East, Russia. And so, overall EMEA is again strong engines of growth that is being built over this year and now in the post-COVID acceleration is proving its role of building strong engines of growth, so all very strong. Tracey? Yes. So to speak to the travel retail trends. First of all, the travel retail globally was strong and was accelerating versus the previous quarter. And yes, the -- in Asia, there were some elements of acceleration. Yes, Hainan was very strong, as Tracey was saying, but I want also to underline that there was a strong growth in EMEA and North America, as I think Tracey said during her prepared remarks as well, which was linked to more traffic during holidays in these regions despite the Omicron variant growth. Now this is a very important sign because the reactivity of travel retail sales to traffic increase is extraordinary. And we have seen this in EMEA, for example, during the last quarter, quarter two. So the first good news is the where traffic increase, travel retail respond very, very fast. And the other good news is what Tracey was speaking about the overall retail growth across despite some of the closures and some of the restrictions. The -- on Hainan, Hainan is becoming an extraordinary place, luxury, with amazing experiences. So it's probably one of the channels around the world, which is more equity building for the brand. So that's an important thing to underline. Also, in Hainan, there are many new retailers, which are opening. And so in Hainan, there is more distribution being built in several retailers, which are investing in the island. That's also something that will generate and will continue to generate expansion growth over time. Yes. And maybe one thing on that, to add, Tracey, is the clarification, when the growth of international travel will restart. This will be only moderately cannibalizing anything like Hainan or domestic travel because remember that the external travel is only for people with passports. And there is a relatively small percentage that people in Asia has a passport to travel internationally. Well, Hainan is domestic travel. It is open to the entire population. So the -- when international travel will restart, this will be almost all net extra. Yes. By the way, this is a great question, and I admire the knowledge you have of our amazing talented team. So thank you for the question. And so what you're seeing actually is the reflection of our culture. What you're seeing is some organization changes, reflecting the shape of the business, particularly the elevation of China to be an independent region, given the importance of this region and the need of coordination with travel retail with the other key part of the Company, including online. And so that's an important next step that will make our ability to work with China and our ability of our China team to get support for grow the capabilities increased. So, the organization is basically increasing our power of execution in China, the change -- the organization changes. In terms of the changes of senior leadership, they are all well planned retirement plans. The culture of the Company is that our leaders share with us their plans in advance. We plan this with time and in a very professional way. And the very good news is that we have extraordinary succession plans already in place because all the succession of this position has been managed mostly with people that were ready for taking this position that were trained for years to take this position. So, I think you should take out of this the strength of our succession planning. That is also the reflection of our culture. And the culture is more and more collaborative cultures, which is united by our compass work, by our strategy work and our execution. Collaborative execution is the result of very clear common goals and very uniting reward systems to make this organization working team. And this has been -- since 2009 to today is progressing step-by-step gradually. I think today, we are a well-oiled organization at the top. Yes. And if I can just underline one thing that Tracey has explained is that is really between quarter three and quarter four is rebalance. We are taking up the year and we believe in the strength of the year. And if you look at our fiscal year estimate is our guidance is going to be a very strong year. And it's going to be a very strong quarter four in this year. The quarter three, we have three big, big launches where we have investment in quarter three and the benefits in quarter four. And that's the important thing. And then the price increases that we are accelerating as of January, February in certain regions, as Tracey explained, have the biggest impact, the full impact in quarter four. And so that's the rebalance we are doing. But in total, we are going to deliver -- we are guiding a very strong year and a strong quarter four, and we are confident on it. Yes. First of all, we are not promotional in China Mainland. Actually, the majority of our activities are sampling rather than pricing promotions. So if for promotional we mean that we have increased our sampling, our products that we give as a gift when -- that's our promotional model. Yes, we have been -- obviously, in 11.11 during the quarter, we have done the promotional needed to succeed in that event. And I think... Yes. Thank you, Tracey, to clarify that retailers rising a promotion, they decide. We don't decide. But our promotion, as I was saying, is a lot about sampling and creating trial opportunities. So it's expensive rather than pricing. And then obviously, the retailers do what they believe is right for them in a given environment. The -- your question on travel retail, I think I have extreme high expectation for the long-term quality of travel retail growth. I think this is extremely promising channel. We have just seen the beginning of what will be a long-term powerful channel expansion for travel retail. And I spoke to these several other times. There are two drivers of travel retail, which are very important. One is the, obviously, the amount of travelers and what happens to travel, so the traffic. But the other is the conversion. So the amount of travelers that become shoppers. And the conversion of travelers into shoppers has been pre-COVID was still in the 10%, 15%, depending by region. So, enormous expansion possibility of conversion are still in front of us. And the arrival of online in travel retail, which we call pretail today is very strong in Asia, but just the very, very beginning in any other region of the world. This is, we know, is a huge conversion driver because where this happened, we saw conversions of travelers into shoppers go from the 10%, 15% into the 30s. So you can imagine over time with expansion of the online possibility to buy pretail that conversion will dramatically grow around the world of travel retail. When you have this perspective, the fact that the domestic duty free Hainan thing is going to be not cannibalized a lot when international travel will restart, as I explained, in the previous answer. And so, that the international traffic will come back. A lot of it will be net extra. And when you have in front of us, the prove that I was quoting before then where, for example, in EMEA, we have seen some new -- some traffic coming back during the recent holidays, we saw great sales recovery. And so the responsiveness of travel retail to traffic coming back is very, very high. And so when you combine all these considerations and you put on top of it that we have a great travel retail team, not only with extraordinary commercial capabilities, but with great marketing capability, that the traveling stores -- the stores for travelers are becoming more and more an important driver for everything we do, a super important equity building opportunity for the brands. And so they're becoming an integral part of the creation of the overall consumer experience and the trial repeat dynamic that we've built. So, I hope you realize why we do believe in travel retail as a long-term strategic channel."

            "name": "Tracey Travis",
            "content": "Thank you, Fabrizio, and hello, everyone. As you just heard, our momentum continued in our second quarter, with net sales growing 11% organically and 14% in total, led by a continued overall progression and recovery despite the volatility inherent across markets with a prolonged pandemic. We had a solid holiday performance across all of our regions. The inclusion of sales from the May 2021 DECIEM investment added approximately three points to reported net sales growth, and the currency impact was neutral. From a geographic standpoint, organic net sales in the Americas rose 19% as holiday shoppers' return to brick-and-mortar retail where we had an exciting array of gifting products and holiday activations in store. And even with more consumers' shopping in stores, organic sales online also grew solidly in the Americas, with online representing more than 1/3 of sales in the region. Every market in the region contributed to sales growth this quarter, and the inclusion of sales from DECIEM added approximately five points to the total reported sales growth in the region. In our Europe, the Middle East and Africa region, organic net sales rose 13%. Growth was diverse and broad-based, with global travel retail as well as every market contributing. All channels grew, led by double-digit growth across brick-and-mortar as recovery continued in both developed and emerging markets in the region. Despite a strong performance during key shopping moments, organic sales online declined slightly, primarily driven by the U.K. due to a tough comparison with the prior year, which was more severely impacted by brick-and-mortar lockdowns. The inclusion of sales from DECIEM added about three points to total reported sales growth in the region. Our global travel retail business grew low double digits. Travel restrictions have eased globally, and international passenger traffic continued to progressively improve, resulting in some stores reopening during the quarter, particularly in Europe and the Americas. Travel retail continues to be led by Asia/Pacific where demand from Chinese consumers remained strong. In our Asia/Pacific region, organic net sales rose 5%. Most of the markets in the region grew, led by Mainland China and Australia, although we continue to see variability in COVID restrictions and retail traffic across markets. Sales grew across most major channels in the region, especially online, which benefited from the recent launch of three brands on JD.com. The inclusion of sales from DECIEM added approximately one point to total reported sales growth in the region. From a category standpoint, organic net sales of fragrances grew 30% with double-digit increases across all regions. Exceptional double-digit increases from Jo Malone London, Tom Ford Beauty, Le Labo and Kilian Paris reflected strong performances from hero products, new product launches, and the continued growth of the Bath & Body and Home subcategories. Organic net sales in makeup rose 12% as consumers in the Americas and Europe responded to social media activation, holiday assortments and trends. Este\u0301e Lauder foundations continue to resonate very strongly with consumers, especially those in the Double Wear and Futurist franchises. M\u00b7A\u00b7C continued to drive the makeup renaissance with engaging, interactive campaigns throughout the quarter, like the special M\u00b7A\u00b7C trend Halloween report and solid holiday collections. Too Faced, Tom Ford Beauty, Smashbox and Bobbi Brown also contributed to growth in the category this quarter. Organic net sales in skin care grew 7%, reflecting double-digit increases from La Mer, Clinique and Bobbi Brown. The inclusion of sales from DECIEM added four percentage points to reported growth. Our organic net sales in hair care rose 18% as traffic in salons and stores improved, primarily in the Americas. Aveda's growth came mostly from holiday gifts and hero franchises and in online and freestanding stores, while Bumble and bumble focused on recruiting new consumers in the specialty-multi channel. Our gross margin improved 20 basis points compared to last year. The benefits of strategic price increases and favorable currency more than offset the impact of higher makeup mix and lower gross margin on DECIEM products. Inflationary pressures in our supply chain are expected to begin to more prominently impact cost of goods in our fiscal third quarter. Operating expenses decreased 140 basis points as a percent of sales. Our leverage of selling expense and general and administrative expense was partially offset by increases in advertising and shipping costs, the latter due to both inflation and our direct-to-consumer online growth. Operating income rose 22% to $1.44 billion, and our operating margin expanded 160 basis points to 25.9% in the quarter. Our tax rate at 21.4% continued at a more normal level this year versus the prior year, which was impacted by a onetime benefit associated with GILTI. Diluted EPS of $3.01 increased 15% compared to the prior year. For the six months, we generated $1.85 billion in net cash flows from operating activities compared to $1.98 billion last year, which reflects both a return to more normalized working capital needs as well as increased inventory to mitigate some of the risk of supply chain disruption given the ongoing global macro challenges. We significantly increased our capital investment to $459 million to support the construction of our new production facility near Tokyo as well as investments in our online business and other technology enhancements. And we returned $1.84 billion in cash to stockholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends, with an increase in our dividend rate occurring in the second quarter. So turning now to our outlook, we delivered an exceptional first half characterized by strong and diversified double-digit organic sales growth and disciplined cost management in the context of intermittent COVID disruptions, including the rise of the Omicron variant, high inflation and volatility. Looking ahead, we are raising guidance to reflect our expectation for a strong year despite the potential further spread of Omicron, supply chain challenges and increased inflationary pressures. Inflation and transportation and procurement is expected to impact our cost of goods in the second half. However, the benefit of pricing and cost mitigation efforts are helping to offset some of the inflation impacts for the fiscal year. At this time, we expect pricing to add approximately 3.5 points of growth with the inclusion of the additional pricing actions we are taking during our second half. We are planning to support the continuation of the recovery with increased point-of-sale staffing as retail traffic continues to gradually improve. We are also planning to support key hero franchise launches in our third quarter from Este\u0301e Lauder, La Mer and Origins with increased marketing and advertising support. This investment will increase cost towards the latter part of the third quarter with more of the benefit to be realized in the fourth quarter. For the full fiscal year, organic net sales are forecasted to grow 10% to 13%. Based on rates of 1.146 for the euro, 1.357 for the pound and 6.399 for the Chinese yuan, we expect currency translation to be negligible for the full year. This range excludes approximately three points from acquisitions, divestitures and brand closures, primarily the inclusion of DECIEM. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $7.43 and $7.58 before restructuring and other charges. This includes approximately $0.07 of accretion from currency translation and $0.03 of accretion from DECIEM. In constant currency, we expect EPS to rise by 14% to 17%. We expect organic sales for our third quarter to rise 8% to 10%. The net incremental sales from acquisitions, divestitures and brand closures are expected to add about three points to reported growth, and currency is forecasted to be negative by about one point. We expect third quarter EPS of $1.55 to $1.65. Currency is expected to be $0.01 accretive to EPS, and the inclusion of DECIEM is not expected to be material. In closing, our results thus far clearly demonstrate the power of our diversified portfolio. Temporary softness in our Eastern markets driven by the pandemic was again offset by renewed growth in our Western markets. A resulting slight slowing of growth in skin care was offset by remarkable growth in fragrances. We continue to be choiceful about where we invest, and the flexibility we have built into our cost structure is helping us to mitigate some of the COVID-related disruptions and inflation while allowing us to continue to invest appropriately in our future growth. This agility, along with the resilience of our remarkable teams worldwide, gives us confidence that we can continue to manage through the temporary complexities caused by the prolonged pandemic by focusing clearly on our long-term strategy and executing against it with excellence. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time. Yes. Thanks Peter. In terms of the operating leverage that we've seen thus far, it has been terrific, obviously, in the first half. One of the things to keep in mind is our launch cadence in terms of when we actually have big product launches does affect quarter-to-quarter performance. But we certainly have continued to see some of the benefits of cost not returning. But brick-and-mortar is picking up. And clearly, we're continuing to ramp up in the third and fourth quarter, our selling staff to support greater brick-and-mortar sales. So when you look at our full year, the overall margin expansion that is included in our guidance is around 90 basis points. So well ahead of our guidance in terms of 50 basis points a year from a long-term perspective. And that includes not only some of the costs not fully returning, but also includes some of the incremental costs related to managing this pandemic, some of the safety procedures we've had in place, some of the additional testing that we have in place, et cetera, that we are incurring. But we certainly expect continued growth from our higher margin channels and categories in the future that will continue to benefit us going forward. No. Ex-travel retail. EMEA ex-travel retail. Yes. And in terms of the margin, we still, in the second quarter, did have quite a few open positions as it relates to our selling staff and certainly hope to be able to close that gap in the third and the fourth quarter. The big difference in the second half of the year is we will be spending more advertising as a percent of sales in the second half of the year to support the launches that we mentioned in the prepared remarks. And that will certainly impact particularly in Q3 the margin, and we expect to see the benefit of that in Q4, but really beyond. I mean these are our largest skin care brands, particularly Este\u0301e Lauder and La Mer and the hero franchise reformulations that we are doing on some of the products are really quite significant for us going forward. So that also should help the skin care category grow a bit. But again, skin care is largely affected by some of the shutdowns in high concentration skin care markets like the Asia/Pacific market. So certainly, as that market picks up, we expect that skin care will pick up as well. That, too, I would attribute to more of a temporary slowdown than anything else. Well, let me start with the -- your question on what we called out in terms of some of the disruptions that occurred in Hainan relative to the strong low double-digit growth that we had in travel retail. For the first quarter, actually, we had greater double-digit growth in travel retail. And so when you look at the first quarter versus the second quarter, while it was double digit, it was a bit less than in the first quarter, and that was a direct impact from the restrictions that occurred within China that impacted Hainan. We don't expect that level in the balance of the year. So we do expect to see travel retail pick up in the balance of the year. So Hainan continues to be a very strong driver of our travel retail business. And it is incredibly luxurious, and I know Fabrizio likes to talk about Hainan. So I will let him expand on that as well. But we continue to expand our presence in Hainan and continue to see fantastic, fantastic consumer receptivity to our brands in Hainan. And regarding your question on travel outside of China, once travel restrictions are lifted, we certainly expect people to start traveling back to Japan and Korea and Thailand and other travel destinations for vacation as well as for business. So we certainly expect that those travel retail corridors will continue to recover similarly to what we've seen the start of in EMEA and the Americas, although traffic is still well behind, obviously, pre-pandemic levels. So, more growth to come as it relates to travel retail. Okay. Well, in terms of 11.11, yes, certainly, 11.11 continues to be -- to get more and more competitive. And we've spoken in the past about how we do promotion as it relates to 11.11. A lot of it is done with samples. And certainly, increasingly, there is more and more media support for 11.11 as well. It is a big opportunity for us as we view it to recruit new consumers, and it is one of the biggest events that we have during the course of the year to -- in a concentrated period of time, have the ability to recruit new consumers, which then we retain work -- to retain over the balance of the future years. So media costs have gone, for sure. Live streaming activity has gone up, for sure. And we have shifted and adjusted our activity to make sure that our brands perform well within that environment. So it's a big planning event for the organization. We're really pleased with how our brands performed in general during 11.11 and have already started planning for next year's 11.11, which -- that's how long in advance we have to plan for it. So as it relates to the cadence of Q3 and Q4, we have spoken -- Olivia, I know you know for many years about the fact that we focus on the year. And we guide quarter-to-quarter, but we focus on managing the year. And in any given year, we might have very large product launches in the first quarter, or in the case of this year, in the third quarter. And so we do feel very positive about the future, obviously. And it is a rebalancing, to your point, between the third quarter and the fourth quarter. The other thing that is embedded in our guidance for the third quarter, quite honestly, is the fact that Omicron is still impacting brick-and-mortar. We also have beauty of weather here in New York. But Omicron is impacting the environment and in brick-and-mortar. So we are seeing a slower recovery in the third quarter for brick-and-mortar than certainly we saw just a few months ago. And so we are cautious as it relates to that. And then I did mention that we do have a step up in -- continued step-up in some of our shipping costs and some of our supply chain costs as well. We have taken pricing. So the second half of the year, our pricing increase is 4%, it was 3% in the first half of the year since, hence, the average of 3.5%, which I spoke about in my prepared remarks. And we know we have agility going forward if this environment continues to take additional pricing as it warrants. But the combination of pricing and cost savings are really what allows us to invest for long-term sustainable growth in things like a new innovation center in Shanghai, the new plant that we are investing in, in Japan as well as the investments we're making and the other capabilities that Fabrizio spoke about and deliver a very, very strong year in terms of double-digit top line growth and 90 basis points of margin expansion. And because I know our brands are listening, so we do have three big skin care launches in the third quarter, but we do have makeup, fragrance and hair care launches as well that we are supporting. And Wendy, just realize that retailers with the slowdown in brick-and-mortar are also promotional. And so they are using promotion to drive traffic. So when we have seen -- and we saw a bit of this as well in the U.S. market when brick-and-mortar slowed down that some of the retail activity was quite promotional. So that is clearly a retailer-driven decision. And again, I think we feel very good. When you look at this quarter, the results that we achieved, travel retail had a great quarter, as we said, low double-digit growth, but the overall company grew at 14%. So, the diversified engines of growth that we have, really gives us the flexibility to continue to deliver overall against our expectations and grow our consumers and grow our profits."

During the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to 1 question so that we can respond to all of you within the time scheduled for this call. And now I will turn the call over to Fabrizio.\nFabrizio Freda: Thank you, Rainey, and hello, everyone. We are grateful you have joined us today. We delivered excellent performance to begin fiscal year 2022, reinforcing our optimism in the opportunities of tomorrow as we discussed with you in August. Our multiple engines of growth strategy enabled us to excel amid continued volatility and variability from the pandemic. Organic sales rose 18% and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew an even stronger 31%. Encouragingly, relatively to the pre -pandemic first quarter of fiscal year 2020, our business is 13% larger on a reported basis and more profitable. We achieved these outstanding results with increasingly diverse growth engines as we expected, by virtue of our dynamics strategy we could act locally amid the complexity of the pandemic to both create and capture demand. The growth engines of makeup, developed markets in the West and Brick-and-mortar reunited and complemented momentum in skincare, fragrance, Mainland China, travel retail in Asia-Pacific and global online. 13 brands contributed double-digit organic sales growth, demonstrating the breadth of strengths across our portfolio.  If the loader and MAC drove Makeup Allergic Renaissance, while La Mer, and Clinique delivered standout results in Skin Care. Impressively, Skin Care solidly outpaced its three-year organic sales growth performance despite having the far toughest comparison among the categories. Fragrance soared double-digits, driven by Tom Ford Beauty and Jo Malone London. Let me share a few highlights by brand Estee Lauder advanced planning for the Makeup Renaissance delivered significant sales growth. As social and professional use education resumed in certain markets, the brand was well-positioned with compelling innovation, superb merchandising, and on-point communication. Its double wear and futurist foundation franchises, grows strong double-digits while it's new pure color whipped matte lipstick was a hit. MAC strategically engaged consumers to drive performance in makeup.  In the Americas and EMEA, excellent results from in-store activations and regional MAC The Moment campaigns, combined with desirable innovation like Lustreglass Sheer-Shine Lipstick and Magic Extension Mascara. The brand's new omni -channel capabilities, which leveraged its free-standing stores, also contributed to the strength. It demonstrates a new capability for MAC to benefit from going forward. La Mer performed magnificent and led the Company, with sales rising strong double-digits. Its new The Hydrating Infused Emulsion expanded our portfolio of East to West innovation, captivating consumers in every region.  The product successes are many, as it welcome new and younger consumer, as well as men into the brand and created a powerful hollow benefit for La Mer Skin Care portfolio. It is a striking example of the innovation gains we can achieve when the power of our data analytics, combined with our creative talent and R&D. La Mer's iconic Creme De La Mer prospered as a new global campaign focused on its most store rising benefit realized terrific initial results. Clinique thrived in skin care from the strength of its heroes. Moreover, its new smart clinical repair wrinkle correcting serum with powerful clinically led claims and compelling before and after visualizations extend the Clinique winning streak with innovation and farther demonstrated the brand ability to be highly relevant for consumers of all ages. In makeup, Clinique skincare authority drove growth in complexion led subcategories.  While in leap, the brand brilliant leveraged black, Tony viral sensation on TikTok to expand its consumer base, especially among Gen Z. Visium complemented our organic sales growth in skincare with its coveted vegan brand, the ordinary. Visium is known for its transparency, which has enamored it we consumers and in the first quarter it launched the insightful, Everything is Chemicals Campaign. And the new regimen builder by the ordinary on brand.com realized spectacular adaption, further enhancing the brand's powerful online ecosystem. Fragrance momentum continued with stellar double-digit performance in every region powered by hero products and innovation from Tom Ford Beauty, Jo Malone, London, and our seasonal offerings. We are excited for the Estee Lauder brand launch of its luxury collection in the second quarter as it expands our portfolio in the high-growth segment of fragrances.  Our fragrance category benefits from diversification amongst our categories, as well as regions with outstanding performance from both historically strong markets for fragrance and emerging fragrance opportunities. The self-care rituals related to scent, which were embraced during the pandemic, continue even as social and professional use and education resume. Of note, Tom Ford Beauty performed strongly in both fragrance and makeup, such that the brand was among our top performance in the quarter. Is new Ombre Leather Parfum and Heroes wardrobes and Lost Cherry fueled the brand's success. Our growth engines also diversified geographically, led by developed markets in the West. Our business in North America, executed with excellence to deliver strong double-digit organic sales growth, powered by readiness for make - up's emerging renaissance, ongoing strength in skincare, fragrance, and recovery in hair care. Strategic go-to-market initiative supported by on-trend innovation, increased advertise spending and expert in-store visual services delighted consumers. Our expanded consumer reach enhanced these initiatives as Bobby Brown launch in Ulta Beauty exceeded expectation. And we are encouraged by the early results of the new Ulta Beauty at Target and Sephora at Kohl's relationships. In Asia-Pacific, many markets faced COVID-induced lockdowns and temporary store closures, which pressured performance. Despite this, the regional still grew 10% organically driven by strength in Greater China and Korea.  Mainland China achieved double-digit organic sales growth, owing to skincare and fragrance. With online  both higher. We launched locally relevant innovation, which proved highly decidable, while we also increased advertising spending, strategically standard our consumer reach to match success on JD, and designed successful activation for Chinese Valentine's Day. We continue to invest in the vibrant and compelling long-term growth opportunity on Mainland China, led by our talented local team. We are enthusiastic for our new innovation center in Shanghai to open in the second half of this fiscal year. This new world-class innovation center will be the first of its kind for our Company. We did. We will have a unique ability to grow and build on our market and consumer insights, to develop exceptional products to meet and surpass the needs and desires of Chinese consumers. What is more, we are seeing the benefits of recent investment in online fulfillment, which have led to higher service levels in better inventory management, while setting the stage for expanded omnichannel capabilities in the market. From a channel perspective, globally, brick-and-mortar grew strongly in markets which are gradually emerging from the latest waves of COVID-19. We realized excellent results across the board in brick-and-mortar, most especially in the Americas and EMEA. Our brands created excitement in-store with enticing high-touch services and unique activations. We are encouraged by improving trends in the productivity of brick-and-mortar owing to both increased traffic and our strategic actions, including those under the post-COVID business acceleration program. As brick-and-mortar reignites, our global online business continue to showcase its tremendous promise, with impressive organic results despite significant organic sales growth in the year-ago period. Online grew to be nearly doubled the size on a reported basis of the pre-pandemic first quarter of fiscal year 2020. Many markets capitalized on the remarkable new consumer acquisition trend of the pandemic to deliver sustained gain in repeat purchases.  As we seek to engage with consumers in innovative ways, we advanced our work with Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, WeChat and others to capitalize on exciting trends in social commerce. We also deploy the technology solution, which enables brands to better customized consumer outreach by leveraging data to merchandise and personalized communication. This is leading to higher conversion rates for new consumers and a deeper level of relationship building after the initial purchase to force retention. Initiatives such as this, position us well to realize even greater success with trial and repeat. We continued to invest in online to strategically extend our consumer reach and realized promising results. For example, in the first quarter, La Mer launched on Lazada in Southeast Asia to tremendous success. We differentiate in merchandising, unique services, and prestige packaging; making it one of the platforms biggest brand launches ever. Our relationship with Lazada expanded in the current quarter with Jo Malone London debut. Before I close, I wanted to share that today, we will release our fiscal year 2021 social impact and sustainability report. We are incredibly inspired by the achievements of our employees globally. The report highlights initiative across key areas including inclusion, diversity and equity. Climate, packaging, social investments, responsible sources in Green Chemistry. I'm particularly proud of our support to employees globally who face financial hardships due to COVID-19. The ELC Cares Employee Relief Fund awarded nearly 14,000 grants and distributed nearly $8 million through June 30, 2021. Here, a few among the many other highlights of the report. We have continued to contribute to a low carbon future. For the second year in a row, we sourced 100% renewable electricity globally for our direct operations and achieved net-zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. The Company also made strong progress in its science-based targets for Scope 1 and 2 and made efforts toward meeting its Scope 3 science-based targets. We achieved our existing post-consumer recycled content goal ahead of schedule and announced a more ambitious goal to increase the amount of such material in our packages to 25% or more by the end of calendar year 2025.  We're also committed to reduce the amount of building petroleum plastic in our packaging to 50% or less by the end of calendar year 2030. On the last few earnings calls, I discussed actions we're taking to make more progress on our commitments for ratio equity, as well as women advancement and gender equality, which are reflected in the report. We also deepened our work by further aligning the strategy of the Estee Lauder companies charitable foundation to identify support programs at the intersection of climate, justice, human rights, and well-being with a focus on equity. Building upon our legacy of funding girls education and leadership programs. In the beginning of fiscal year 2022 and aligned with our social impact commitments, we were pleased to announce a 3-year partnership with Amanda Gorman, activists, award-winning writers in the youngest in our world poet U.S. history. The Estee Lauder companies will contribute $3 million over three years to support writing change, especially initiative to advance literally as a pathway to a quality access and social change. In addition Mrs. Gorman will bring her voice of change to the Estee Lauder brand. The good thing our first campaign in the second half of this fiscal year. In closing, we delivered outstanding performance to begin the new fiscal year amid the volatility, and variability of the pandemic. While continuing to invest in sustainable long-term growth drivers, we are focusing on fundamental capabilities for product quality and the consumer - centric elements of acquisition, engagement, and high-touch experiences and services.  We are doing this while improving our cost structure, diversifying our portfolio and its distribution, investing behind the best growth opportunities, and leaving our values. Our confidence in the long-term growth opportunities for global prestige beauty and our Company is reflected in the announcement today to raise the quarterly dividend. I'm forever grateful to the grace, wisdom, and ingenuity of our employees globally, while making us a stronger Company each and every day. I will now turn the call over to Tracey.\nTracey Travis: Thank you, Fabrizio and hello everyone. We're off to an outstanding start with first quarter net sales growing 18% organically driven by the Nascent recovery in the Americas and EMEA during the quarter compared to a more difficult environment in the prior year. Global logistic constraints caused some retailers, primarily in North America, to order earlier to ensure popular sets and products would be on counter for Holidays. We estimate that this contributed approximately 1.5 points to our first-quarter sales growth that otherwise would have occurred in the second quarter. The inclusion of sales from the May 2021 DECIEM investments added approximately 3 points to reported net sales, growth and currency added just over 2 points. From a geographic standpoint, organic net sales in the Americas climbed 27% as COVID restrictions eased throughout the region. Brick-and-mortar retail grew sharply across all formats compared to the prior year period when many stores were temporarily shutdown. Distribution and Kohl's with Sephora and in target with Ulta Beauty, began its phased roll-out to initial stores and online in mid August with minimal impact on net sales growth for the quarter. With the strong resurgence of Brick-and-mortar traffic online, organic sales growth in the Americas declined single-digit against the sharp increase last year, while organic online penetration remains solid at 31% of sales. The inclusion of sales from DECIEM added about 9 points to the overall reported growth in the region.  In our Europe, the Middle East, and Africa region, organic net sales rose 19% with virtually every market contributing to growth led by the emerging markets in the Middle East, Turkey, and Russia, as well as the U.K. Most markets throughout the regions saw COVID restrictions lifted and some tourism resume during the peak summer months. By channel, the region saw more balance between brick-and-mortar and online growth. All major categories grew this quarter and the region saw the strongest growth in fragrance and makeup as social occasions increased. Our global travel retail business grew double-digit as China and Korea continued to be strong. Internal travel restrictions during the quarter in China slowed Hainan sales temporarily, but restrictions lifted in early September and traffic rebounded. Retailers also responded to the August dip by driving post-travel consumption online. Summer holiday travel in Europe and the Americas ticked up but international travels still reached only 40% of pre-COVID levels. In our Asia-Pacific region, organic net sales rose 10% and driven by Greater China and Korea. The region overall experienced higher levels of COVID lockdowns this quarter, compared to last year's quarter due to the rise of the Delta variant, although online remains strong.  Sales growth in Mainland, China was somewhat slower due to COVID restrictions during July and August and the pace of online sales growth slowed following the successful 6-18 programs last quarter, and in anticipation of the 11.11 Shopping Festival. As we've mentioned before, these key shopping moments have created some additional seasonality in our business in this region. More than half of our brands, and virtually all channels rose double-digit in Mainland China. Hong Kong and Macau were bright spots this quarter. They benefited from strong new product launches from La Mer and Jo Malone and successful marketing campaigns from several other brands. From a category perspective, net sales growth in fragrance jumped nearly 50%. Virtually every brand that participates in the category contributed to growth with exceptional double-digit increases from Tom Ford Beauty, Jo Malone London, and La LeBeau. Perfumes and colognes led the category growth and bath, body and home fragrances continued to perform well. Net sales in makeup rose 18% as markets in the Americas and Europe began to recover from COVID shutdowns. We are encouraged by the sequential improvement in makeup versus pre - COVID level. However, makeup sales in the quarter was still 19% below 2 years ago. Nonetheless, Estee Lauder foundations continued to resonate strongly with consumers, and MAC leaned into the makeup recovery with a number of fun and compelling campaign. Skin care sales remained strong during the quarter. Organic net sales grew 12% and the inclusion of sales from DECIEM added 6 percentage points to reported growth. Nearly all of our skincare brands contributed to growth, although Estee Lauder had a tough comparison with the prior year launch of its improved Advanced Night Repair serum. Our hair care net sales rose 8% as traffic in salons and stores in the U.S. and Europe began to return. Both Aveda and Bumble and bumble saw growth in hair products as well as continued strength from innovation. Our gross margin declined 100 basis points compared to the first quarter last year. The positive impacts from strategic pricing and currency were more than offset by higher obsolescence costs for both basic and holiday product sets and the inclusion of Visium. Operating expenses decreased 240 basis points as a percent of sales. Our strong sales growth was partly due to earlier orders from some North America retailers concerned about logistics constraints and costs related to these sales are expected to be incurred in our second quarter. We do continue to manage costs with agility, realizing savings from our cost initiatives while also investing to support a continued brick-and-mortar recovery, as well as our strategic initiatives. Our operating income rose 32% to $941 million, and our operating margin rose 140 basis points to 21.4% in the quarter. Diluted EPS of a $1.89 increased 31% compared to the prior year. During the quarter, we used 81 million in net cash flows from operating activities, which was below the prior year. This reflects a more normalized first quarter where we typically have seasonally higher working capital needs. We invested $205 million in capital expenditures as we ramped up our investment to build the new manufacturing facility in Japan, and we returned $749 million in cash to stockholders through both share repurchases and dividends. We also announced this morning, an increase in our quarterly dividend. Now let's turn to our outlook. We are encouraged by the green shoots we are seeing around the world even in the context of an environment of increased volatility. Our strong performance reflects our ability to navigate through the volatility while leveraging our multiple engines of growth. At the same time, we are mindful that recovery is tenuous and likely to be uneven. Nevertheless, we are cautiously optimistic in our assumption for fiscal 2022 remain consistent. We continue to expect an emerging Renaissance in the makeup category as restrictions are safely lifted and social occasions increase. We welcome the resumption of some travel in the Americas and EMEA in the first quarter. And as intercontinental restrictions are lifted, we expect international passenger traffic to build toward the end of the fiscal year. We began taking strategic pricing actions in July and overall, pricing is expected to add at least 3 points of growth, helping to offset inflationary pressures. On the cost side, we plan to continue to increase advertising to support our brands and drive traffic in all channels. Selling costs are expected to rise to support the reopening of brick-and-mortar retail. We also continue to invest behind key strategic capabilities like data analytics, innovation, technology, and sustainability initiatives. As you are all aware, global supply chains are being strained by COVID and it's related effects in some markets, resulting in port congestion, higher fuel costs, and labor shortages at a time when demand for goods is rising. This is causing us to experience inflation in freight and procurement, which we expect to impact our cost of goods and operating expenses beginning next quarter. Based on what we see through October, the expected benefit of pricing combined with good cost discipline elsewhere, are enabling us to maintain our expectations for the year. For the full fiscal year, organic net sales are forecasted to grow 9% to 12%. Based on rates of 1.163 for the euro, 1.351 for the pound, and 6.471 for the Chinese yuan, we expect currency translation to be negligible for the full fiscal year. This range excludes approximately 3 points from acquisitions, divestitures, and brand closures, primarily the inclusion of DECIEM. Diluted EPS is expected to range between 723 and 738 before restructuring another charges. This includes approximately $0.04 of accretion from currency translation and $0.03 accretion from DECIEM. In constant currency, we expect EPS to rise 11% to 14%. At this time we expect organic sales for our second quarter to rise 8% to 10%. The net incremental sales from acquisitions, divestitures, and brand closures are expected to add about 3 points to reported growth, and currency is forecasted to be neutral.  Operating expenses are expected to rise in the second quarter as we support holiday activations and the continued recovery of brick-and-mortar retail around the world. Additionally, the prior-year quarter included some benefit of government subsidies which are not anticipated in the current year quarter. We expect second quarter EPS of $2.51 to $2.61. Both currency and the inclusion of DECIEM are expected to be immaterial to EPS. Notably, our EPS forecast also reflects a 23% tax rate compared to 15.9% in the prior year when we benefited from certain one-time line up In closing, we are pleased with the terrific start to the year and are proud of the continued efforts of our global team. We remain confident in our corporate strategy with its multiple growth engines to drive sustainable, profitable growth. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time.\nOperator: Thank you. The floor is now open for your questions.  I to ensure that everyone can ask their question. We will limit each person to one question, time permitting, we will return you for additional.  And our first question today comes from Erinn Murphy, Piper Sandler.\nErinn Murphy: Great. Thank you. Good morning. I guess my question is around the supply chain, Tracey for you, if you could talk a little bit more about your ability to get product to the end markets in a timely manner into holiday. And are you seeing any major shifts in product launches? And then maybe if you can share, if you think about the higher OpEx, how you're balancing air freight versus ocean freight currently? Thank you so much.\nTracey Travis: Yeah. Hi, Erinn. We are seeing some supply chain impact as I said in our prepared remarks. We have experienced some airfreight and we have experienced some delays, but by and large, we're in very good shape for holiday. Our holiday sets, we had anticipated some of the supply chain challenges earlier in the year when clearly our supply chain -- and more publicly, there were discussions about supply chain challenges. And so we did order some products early, we produce some products early, and we landed many of our gift sets early. And that's set us up pretty well for Q2. We are experiencing some inflation in transport, we're managing it as best we can. One of the things that certainly we have the benefit of is we are a luxury Company, so we do have pricing power, and we have pricing power not only in our inline products, but also in our innovation as well. So we do have the opportunity and have taken the opportunity to offset some of the cost inflation with some of the pricing that we've taken this year.\nOperator: And our next question is going to come from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thank you so much. Good morning. I'm really curious to hear a little bit more about MAC. I would certainly have expected it to be key in the beginning of this makeup resurgence. But I was curious what you could tell us in terms of progress on brick-and-mortar footprint in North America and EMEA, how that interacts with the online presence, and how you think about the profit model for that brand or maybe from the makeup category going forward? We're 1 quarter into the beginning of a recovery, but I recognize that looking at operating margins the division isn't really fair game yet. But interested to hear how you think that can evolve over the next, whatever the appropriate time frame, in the 12 plus months or so.\nTracey Travis: Yeah. Hi, Lauren. So you stated out, and at the very beginning, what -- your question is about what specifically?\nLauren Lieberman: About MAC,\nTracey Travis: Oh, MAC, yeah.\nLauren Lieberman: Mac, and how the brick-and-mortar footprint, where you've gotten to so far, how that fits with online presence and how you're thinking about the business model going forward and what that means for profitability.\nTracey Travis: Yeah, no. As we announced last year in our post COVID acceleration program, we did take the opportunity last year to close some stores and some additional stores will close this year. And not only freestanding stores, but there are some counters as well that MAC has pulled that up. We were encouraged at the end of last year and encouraged through the first quarter with MAC performance in both the Americas. So both North America, as well as Latin America, and also EMEA. So we really -- with return to brick-and-mortar, as we had indicated before, we saw a higher productivity of the remaining brick-and-mortar doors that we had open, and we saw a bit of softness more in North America than in EMEA, but a bit of softness in online as traffic return to brick-and-mortar. We think that will normalize out a bit in Q2 and we will see a bit more balanced, but as I think all of us can imagine, I think consumers were very excited about going back to brick-and-mortar stores in markets where restrictions were lifted, and people felt more comfortable going out and socializing.\nFabrizio Freda: Just -- can I add that there's also MAC has been a good start in the Ulta target experience. It's a great start in the preparation of the holiday season. And the brand is doing very well online and is one of the brands that is benefiting from the service acceleration online both in U.S. and EMEA. So overall, very good progress from MAC obviously, as you would expect in the contest of the makeup acceleration for consumers in general.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.\nNik Modi: Yeah. Hi, good morning, everyone. I got a question on consumer behavior. Just on online, what you're seeing there in terms of stickiness retention? Obviously, that's an important channel from a profitability standpoint and consumer engagement. So I just wanted to understand that. And then also, Fabrizio, you think about what happened during the pandemic as consumers are migrating to well-known brands, exploration came down a bit, but I suspect that that's starting to happen now as consumers are getting back out and exploring different brands. I just wanted to get your perspective on that dynamic, if that's what you're seeing, and how does Estee better prepare in the future to deal with all of these upstart brands that are starting up on social media? Thank you.\nFabrizio Freda: So, I think there are 2 question. So what we see online? Obviously, online is doing pretty well on a two-year stack, we've doubled it. And so it's a very strong acceleration versus two years. And we see the progress to continue and the growth to continues. Obviously, in the moment where there was the opening of brick-and-mortar, the amount of growth online slow down, but the continuous growth is what is really encouraging. So the most important part of your question, what happened to the consumer's behavior. So what we saw during COVID, that the consumers that were already online before, like younger consumer, continue to be online even more intensively. But  many new consumers, they just appeared online during the COVID. They were more the ageless consumer, the more adults consumers. Now, this consumer really enjoyed so they are staying online and so that's what showed that the online continues to grow even when brick-and-mortar open side. But obviously, the 2 channels growth get re-balanced in this situation. So very optimistic for online. The other thing that the online continues to grow is that there are very different channels with different level of growth and we are growing in every single channel. We are growing in 3PP. We are growing in brand.com. We are growing in retail account. We're growing in the pure place and these are very different by region because in every region, one of this channel is stronger than the others. The combination of the global online growth is continuing to be pretty exciting. And we count to this to continue, even when brick-and-mortar will be fully, fully recovered. And as a result, we have reached already 28% of our business in online and this will gradually continue to grow over time. So very strong. In terms of -- sorry, your second question, because it was a separate question on consumer behaviors in Asia. Could you repeat it?\nNik Modi: Yes, it was around exploration, it died down during the pandemic. Are you seeing consumers explore new brands again, and what is  doing to try to make sure that doesn't become too much of a risk going forward?\nFabrizio Freda: I think the exploration of newness in the world of beauty will continuous, will never stop. And personally, I don't have any data points that suggest was dependent on COVID. The disploration is not only by our new brands, but this disploration is about the newness of the existing brands. In fact, our percentage on newness continues to be very, very high and our innovation program continues to be super exciting. We are continued to be in the 30% of new products per year, which is extraordinary and has been a huge progress in the last years. So we continue to see consumers to be interested in innovation, and we continue to make our innovation program one of the best drivers of growth globally.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is going to come from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey, guys, good morning.\nTracey Travis: Good morning.\nFabrizio Freda: Good morning.\nDara Mohsenian: So just a question of guidance. Clearly, you came in better than expected in terms of fiscal Q1, you mentioned some green shoots, obviously, a makeup recovery, America's recovery, Asia's from Southwest from some of the government lockdowns, inter-quarter, but it sounded like that's getting better. And so I'm just trying to understand the unchanged local currency top-line guidance for the year. Is there something specific that's giving you more caution as you look at the balance for the year? Is it more just some conservatism, given it's early in the year? How do you think about that relative to the Q1 top-line delivery and some green shoots? And maybe specifically also, you can touch on the 11.11 Shopping Festival in China and what you're seeing there in terms of initial signs heading into that festival. Thanks.\nTracey Travis: Yeah. Yeah. Thanks, Dara. In terms of -- we are encouraged obviously, as we should be by our Q1 performance. We're still only at quarter end, as you mentioned, as you mentioned it. We did have some early shipments in the quarter that obviously came out of the second quarter. So some of the growth, as we mentioned, about 1.5 was related to that. But as we look at the balance of the year, we are -- also while we're seeing encouragement, there's still a lot of volatility in the market. We did have some markets unexpectedly that were shut down in the first quarter. We are still managing through this pandemic.  And so we are -- we believe that certainly as you look at Q2 on a 2-year stock basis, it is -- and really versus pre-pandemic, it's really quite strong. And again, you're seeing some of the seasonality related to 11-11, continue to impact Q1, and that's reflected in the -- Q2, and that's reflected in the guidance that we've provided. But we feel that the guidance that we've given for the year is incredibly strong. The only difference between the guidance that we gave last time and this time, is currency. Our outlook on currency is a bit less. So that's the 1 point change in the guidance that you see. And then from a reported EPS standpoint, our guidance actually on a constant currency basis has improved quite a bit.  We -- I would say we are seeing green shoots, we are expressing confidence in the guidance that we are providing quite a bit when you actually look at it from an EPS standpoint, even with all of the things that we're navigating through as it relates to transport, etc. And that goes to the choices that we're making as an organization in terms of where to invest and where not to invest, along with the pricing actions that we're taking as well.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is going to come from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank.\nSteve Powers: Hey, thanks. First is just a cleanup. Apologies if I missed it, but were the early holiday sales in North America that you've mentioned in the first quarter  to any particular brand or product category? That'd be helpful. And what I really want to ask you about was picking up on something there I mentioned, but I'm not sure you addressed Tracey, was just the relative softness in China and Asia that you experienced in the quarter against the curtailed mobility backdrop versus the improvement that you saw in September. and what I hear is enthusiasm entering December at around the 11.11 Holiday. Maybe you could just expand on a little bit on how trends evolve through the September quarter and then what you're expecting in the Asia-Pacific region, as we go through fiscal 2Q? Thank you.\nTracey Travis: Yeah. Now, so, Steve, in terms of the early shipments, obviously, our larger brands would have comprised most of the larger -- most of the sales dollar volume in terms of those shipments, but it was really across the board. And again, both we and our retailers wanted to make sure that we had our holiday programs, as well as some of our basic product in-store, recognizing the severe constraint that is being projected as it relates to transport during this holiday season. So we feel very good about that. In terms of Asia-Pacific inclusive of China, but other markets as well. We did see some intermittent shutdowns in Asia and that did include some traffic to Hainan being a bit curtailed in the July and August time frame and a bit into the early part of September. We saw, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, Hainan picked up quite a bit when those travel restrictions were lifted almost immediately. That is a positive sign and we are still quite encouraged with respect to China and the performance that we expect to see certainly for the balance of the year, both in China and Mainland, China and with Chinese consumers, wherever they shop.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Stephanie Wisinc(ph ) with Jefferies.\nGrace Menk: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. This is Grace . I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about the strength that you're seeing in fragrance and just touch on the sustainability there. Is anything assumed in your guidance for fragrance and then also on a similar vein, if there's anything assumed for the makeup recovery in the second half in guidance. Thank you.\nFabrizio Freda: Yeah. No, we see obviously a very strong fragrance mascot and we see great growth in every single regions. So it's good. We see particularly strong fragrance traction in the high-end fragrances, in what we call the luxury artisan  of our portfolio. This is really a stand, so brands like Jo Malone, Tom Ford, Le Labo, Kilian, Frederic Malle. And -- and we believe this will continue. This is a trend we have identified some years ago and we have focused the growth of our portfolio and our innovation on this kind of highly sophisticated fragrance experiences. And while we have seen that the -- during COVID that this trend is accelerated, the consumers are even more interested. The other interesting thing is during COVID, the element of our fragrance brands that were, for example, home, like candles or personal cleansing, or pampering parts of the lineup beyond the fragrance also was accelerating, and this acceleration continues. So the positives that consumer have learned, also the possibility of the pampering in-house element of products that these brands provide, they continue to buy them also after the COVID period or this COVID thing. So the entire fragrance brands are strong. The fragrance category is strong. And we expect to have a good holiday season. In this area, we expect continuous growth over time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrea Teixeira with JPMorgan.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you. Good morning and congrats on your results. Can you comment on the cadence of the quarter in Asia-Pacific and how you exited? It seems that you had a hiccup in China consumption towards the end of the quarter. And Tracey, you mentioned that in your prepared remarks, and I think  question, but is the deceleration in the fiscal second quarter a function of normalizing the pull forward or more how conservative you're seeing things happening? And then obviously, you have this seasonality they have been calling for 11.11. So if you can just elaborate more on that, I would appreciate. Thank you.\nFabrizio Freda: I mean, we achieved double-digit growth in China this quarter and some very strong double-digits also on a 2 or 3 years stacked basis. So despite the restrictions they were also in July and August. So the Chinese consumer are really strong and we are serving them. We also with a variety of locations, meaning in every channel we see the growth online, we see the growth in brick-and-mortar. We see the growth in high-end and, and our key idea is to serve the Chinese consumers wherever they are, and to serve them in the best possible way. So we manage this with agility. And depending what is the commercial model that is emerging in China, we focused more on 1 channel , also depending by the season and by the moment. Also screen -- skin care, which I think is a great sign of strength, skin care grew strong double-digit despite the very tough comparison with the previous year. While in our case, we launched the Advanced Night Repair relaunch.  So it was a very big innovation in the base period. So brick-and-mortar in China also saw very strong growth, and our business online grew double digits. Despite the fact that in quarter 1, online is a bit normally sandwiched between the 6.18 big event and the 11.11 big event. But despite that, we grew double-digits. And the long term for demand on the market in closing, name ly the large and growing in the class with increasing spending per person, all these remain intact. And so the key idea is to be able to focus on the Chinese consumer, in whatever channel they choose to shop in depending on the moment to the year. And that's where we are doing, and that's why we remain very confident for the remaining of the fiscal year.\nTracey Travis: And Andrea as it relates to the rest of APAC, we are expecting a pickup in the second quarter, so we are not anticipating as many of the restrictions to be in place in the rest of APAC that we saw in Q1.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is going to come from the line of Olivia Tong with Raymond James.\nOlivia Tong: Great. Thank you. Actually, I want to talk a little bit about some of the new brands, like the ordinary. And if you could just give a little bit of commentary around things that you've learned since the majority stake that you've taken and how that could potentially be influencing other brands in your portfolio with respect to where you could potentially invest going forward with retailers might your other brands work in that you may have not have thought about earlier. Thank you.\nFabrizio Freda: Yeah. First of all, DECIEM is an extraordinary Company and The Ordinary is a brand with enormous success in traction. And so first of all, we are collaborating with the management team of DECIEM to continue building both The Ordinary and to continue building the overall DECIEM Company with their extraordinary incubation capability to have a new brand that they are creating for the future. So both of these activities -- so the big learning is obviously the ability to create vast interest, and the relationship between The Ordinary brand and the consumer is really extraordinary. Obviously, we can learn a lot from this. But apart from learning, we can support them in the implementation of the global commercial strategies in increasing the reach for the brand and obviously, in leveraging the powerful connection with the consumer in the best possible way, in supply chain, in R&D, in many, many areas.  So we can learn and we can support, and this exchange is proving to be very successful. Then on top of The Ordinary, there are other brands that building other ideas and creating for the future. So what we're learning is also the power of the creative incubation and the creation on new brands, and these will have an influence on our future ability to continue developing brands. And definitely, we will leverage the strengths of these in most in this area.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel.\nMark Astrachan: Thanks, and good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask about Hainan growth. I think you had mentioned this one from previous calls in terms of where the growth was coming from, meaning that you weren't necessarily sourcing it from sales in the Mainland. I guess I'm curious if that's still the case and how you think about what has driven the growth, especially as it seems like some of the duty-free operators are paying the duties to deliver product to Mainland customers. So if that's true, how do you think this all plays out in time in terms of having Mainland and Hainan or local duty-free work together?\nFabrizio Freda: Keep in mind that in China, our most distributed brand, which is Estee Lauder in 140 cities where today with a strong social media and with the strong aspiration of values of our brand. As we speak, we can -- we are demand in more than 700 cities. So there are many, many consumers in China they can only buy either online or traveling and traveling domestically today. And historically Kelly also traveling internationally. And so the -- it is just the market, commercially, the market is designed to have a very limited  between the Mainland, China, and the Hainan service. An enormous amount of consumer that comes also from Tier 3, Tier 4 cities, areas where there is not a lot of brick-and-mortar distribution. And so Hainan cannot track this consumer in this moment, also is a place where people go for holidays, as part of these holiday's this -- there is a lot of the pleasure of shopping, the pleasure of discovery.  The business in China is proving to be a great trial builder, more than an cannibalizing business and is building trial of people that otherwise would not be able to try our problem, then we'll repurchase them. We'll repurchase them maybe again in the future travel, but most of the times in their everyday lives in Mainland China. So obviously, there is commercial competition. The market is becoming very competitive. There is a lot of players. And commercially, there is that will continue to be intense competition. But there is -- every channel serves, frankly, a very different role. And so our strategy is to be able to leverage each one of these channel in the best possible way. We are maximizing the coverage and the service to the total consumers in China that are interested in Beauty, and over time to be able to better differentiate the scope of the channels and how the consumer will be served by the different channels.  Last thing I want to say, Hainan had at least the last number I've seen over the 80 million visitors in the last year. So if you think that Hainan serves the entire middle class because it's domestic travel. You don't need to have a passport. So today, in our knowledge, about 12% of Chinese consumer at the task force, even when international travel will restart. There will be even limited cannibalization versus international travel, because China would serve many consumers that do not plan to travel internationally. So we are very positive on the long term and very positive on the ability to serve the consumers using different channels, which is our strategy.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi.\nWendy Nicholson: Hi. Two things, if I can. When you were running through the brands and what's growing for you and what's doing. Especially, well, I think you called out La Mer first. And I just wanted to clarify, how much of La Mer's growth is coming from China and Travel Retail or is the brand also growing strongly on -- in the U.S. and Western Europe non - Travel Retail? So that's my first question. And then second thing, I know you said, Tracey, that there was only minimal sales in the first quarter from the pipeline sale into Target and Kohl's, but now that we're already into November, can you comment a little bit about what you're seeing there? And especially, I'm curious what percentage of the sales that you're getting from Target and Kohl's are in makeup as opposed to skin? I'm just wondering that if those 2 channels really take off for you, what kind of mix effect that might have on your North American business? Thanks.\nTracey Travis: Thanks, Wendy. In terms of La Mer, La Mer is growing in pretty much every market. It's incredibly strong, the brand does a fantastic job of innovating and so we're seeing growth from both new innovation as well as a continued expansion of new consumers with some of the strategies that the brand is deploying. And we see very high loyalty and repeat with La Mer, it is all around even during this pandemic, it has been one of the constants in terms of the performance in our portfolio and the La Mer team is just an absolute fantastic team. So the brand is doing incredibly well. As it relates to Kohl's and Target and also within target and Sephora within Kohl. We have seeded the initial doors.  We certainly expect during the upcoming holiday season that we will see increased growth, obviously, in contribution from the distribution that we have, and we're pleased thus far with the partnership. We're seeing more skin care growth and than makeup at the moment. But again, I expect that we will certainly with some of the strong gift programs that our makeup brands have, we expect that we'll see more makeup growth in the second quarter.\nFabrizio Freda: I just wanted to add that our North America growth discourse, which has been extraordinary, is the result of manufacturers. It's definitely not yet the impact of Ulta, Target, or Sephora, or Kohl's. That was just at the beginning and only in the last months of the quarter. So it's the result of many other very positive signs. Also, we have been getting shares with categories during the quarter in Clinique, in MAC, in La Mer, in Bobbi, in Tom Ford, in Jo Malone, so it's a very broad growth across. We are really ready with our innovation with the strong marketing programs. We had anticipated they come back for makeup. We have strengthened our program in what we call the Makeup Renaissance in anticipation on the return to back-to-school or back to work. And we had amazing programs so that we have had the obviously the ordinary, which is the number four brand in a skincare in prestige U.S. to our portfolio. So is a combination of factors of improvement of the strategy and improvement of the execution in our North America organization. So it's a refilled quarter, and we do expect the Ulta Target and Sephora to contribute more in the next quarters, or was not the key contributing factor in quarter one.\nTracey Travis: I think this quarter really represents the diversification that we have within the business that we've talked about. And certainly the North America performance to Fabrizio's point represents that as well.\nOperator: Thank you. And with that, that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. If you were unable to join through the entire call, a playback will be available at 1 PM Eastern today through November 16th. To hear a recording of the call, please dial 855-859-2056.

            "name": "Fabrizio Freda",
            "content": "Thank you, Rainey, and hello, everyone. We are grateful you have joined us today. We delivered excellent performance to begin fiscal year 2022, reinforcing our optimism in the opportunities of tomorrow as we discussed with you in August. Our multiple engines of growth strategy enabled us to excel amid continued volatility and variability from the pandemic. Organic sales rose 18% and adjusted diluted earnings per share grew an even stronger 31%. Encouragingly, relatively to the pre -pandemic first quarter of fiscal year 2020, our business is 13% larger on a reported basis and more profitable. We achieved these outstanding results with increasingly diverse growth engines as we expected, by virtue of our dynamics strategy we could act locally amid the complexity of the pandemic to both create and capture demand. The growth engines of makeup, developed markets in the West and Brick-and-mortar reunited and complemented momentum in skincare, fragrance, Mainland China, travel retail in Asia-Pacific and global online. 13 brands contributed double-digit organic sales growth, demonstrating the breadth of strengths across our portfolio.  If the loader and MAC drove Makeup Allergic Renaissance, while La Mer, and Clinique delivered standout results in Skin Care. Impressively, Skin Care solidly outpaced its three-year organic sales growth performance despite having the far toughest comparison among the categories. Fragrance soared double-digits, driven by Tom Ford Beauty and Jo Malone London. Let me share a few highlights by brand Estee Lauder advanced planning for the Makeup Renaissance delivered significant sales growth. As social and professional use education resumed in certain markets, the brand was well-positioned with compelling innovation, superb merchandising, and on-point communication. Its double wear and futurist foundation franchises, grows strong double-digits while it's new pure color whipped matte lipstick was a hit. MAC strategically engaged consumers to drive performance in makeup.  In the Americas and EMEA, excellent results from in-store activations and regional MAC The Moment campaigns, combined with desirable innovation like Lustreglass Sheer-Shine Lipstick and Magic Extension Mascara. The brand's new omni -channel capabilities, which leveraged its free-standing stores, also contributed to the strength. It demonstrates a new capability for MAC to benefit from going forward. La Mer performed magnificent and led the Company, with sales rising strong double-digits. Its new The Hydrating Infused Emulsion expanded our portfolio of East to West innovation, captivating consumers in every region.  The product successes are many, as it welcome new and younger consumer, as well as men into the brand and created a powerful hollow benefit for La Mer Skin Care portfolio. It is a striking example of the innovation gains we can achieve when the power of our data analytics, combined with our creative talent and R&D. La Mer's iconic Creme De La Mer prospered as a new global campaign focused on its most store rising benefit realized terrific initial results. Clinique thrived in skin care from the strength of its heroes. Moreover, its new smart clinical repair wrinkle correcting serum with powerful clinically led claims and compelling before and after visualizations extend the Clinique winning streak with innovation and farther demonstrated the brand ability to be highly relevant for consumers of all ages. In makeup, Clinique skincare authority drove growth in complexion led subcategories.  While in leap, the brand brilliant leveraged black, Tony viral sensation on TikTok to expand its consumer base, especially among Gen Z. Visium complemented our organic sales growth in skincare with its coveted vegan brand, the ordinary. Visium is known for its transparency, which has enamored it we consumers and in the first quarter it launched the insightful, Everything is Chemicals Campaign. And the new regimen builder by the ordinary on brand.com realized spectacular adaption, further enhancing the brand's powerful online ecosystem. Fragrance momentum continued with stellar double-digit performance in every region powered by hero products and innovation from Tom Ford Beauty, Jo Malone, London, and our seasonal offerings. We are excited for the Estee Lauder brand launch of its luxury collection in the second quarter as it expands our portfolio in the high-growth segment of fragrances.  Our fragrance category benefits from diversification amongst our categories, as well as regions with outstanding performance from both historically strong markets for fragrance and emerging fragrance opportunities. The self-care rituals related to scent, which were embraced during the pandemic, continue even as social and professional use and education resume. Of note, Tom Ford Beauty performed strongly in both fragrance and makeup, such that the brand was among our top performance in the quarter. Is new Ombre Leather Parfum and Heroes wardrobes and Lost Cherry fueled the brand's success. Our growth engines also diversified geographically, led by developed markets in the West. Our business in North America, executed with excellence to deliver strong double-digit organic sales growth, powered by readiness for make - up's emerging renaissance, ongoing strength in skincare, fragrance, and recovery in hair care. Strategic go-to-market initiative supported by on-trend innovation, increased advertise spending and expert in-store visual services delighted consumers. Our expanded consumer reach enhanced these initiatives as Bobby Brown launch in Ulta Beauty exceeded expectation. And we are encouraged by the early results of the new Ulta Beauty at Target and Sephora at Kohl's relationships. In Asia-Pacific, many markets faced COVID-induced lockdowns and temporary store closures, which pressured performance. Despite this, the regional still grew 10% organically driven by strength in Greater China and Korea.  Mainland China achieved double-digit organic sales growth, owing to skincare and fragrance. With online  both higher. We launched locally relevant innovation, which proved highly decidable, while we also increased advertising spending, strategically standard our consumer reach to match success on JD, and designed successful activation for Chinese Valentine's Day. We continue to invest in the vibrant and compelling long-term growth opportunity on Mainland China, led by our talented local team. We are enthusiastic for our new innovation center in Shanghai to open in the second half of this fiscal year. This new world-class innovation center will be the first of its kind for our Company. We did. We will have a unique ability to grow and build on our market and consumer insights, to develop exceptional products to meet and surpass the needs and desires of Chinese consumers. What is more, we are seeing the benefits of recent investment in online fulfillment, which have led to higher service levels in better inventory management, while setting the stage for expanded omnichannel capabilities in the market. From a channel perspective, globally, brick-and-mortar grew strongly in markets which are gradually emerging from the latest waves of COVID-19. We realized excellent results across the board in brick-and-mortar, most especially in the Americas and EMEA. Our brands created excitement in-store with enticing high-touch services and unique activations. We are encouraged by improving trends in the productivity of brick-and-mortar owing to both increased traffic and our strategic actions, including those under the post-COVID business acceleration program. As brick-and-mortar reignites, our global online business continue to showcase its tremendous promise, with impressive organic results despite significant organic sales growth in the year-ago period. Online grew to be nearly doubled the size on a reported basis of the pre-pandemic first quarter of fiscal year 2020. Many markets capitalized on the remarkable new consumer acquisition trend of the pandemic to deliver sustained gain in repeat purchases.  As we seek to engage with consumers in innovative ways, we advanced our work with Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, WeChat and others to capitalize on exciting trends in social commerce. We also deploy the technology solution, which enables brands to better customized consumer outreach by leveraging data to merchandise and personalized communication. This is leading to higher conversion rates for new consumers and a deeper level of relationship building after the initial purchase to force retention. Initiatives such as this, position us well to realize even greater success with trial and repeat. We continued to invest in online to strategically extend our consumer reach and realized promising results. For example, in the first quarter, La Mer launched on Lazada in Southeast Asia to tremendous success. We differentiate in merchandising, unique services, and prestige packaging; making it one of the platforms biggest brand launches ever. Our relationship with Lazada expanded in the current quarter with Jo Malone London debut. Before I close, I wanted to share that today, we will release our fiscal year 2021 social impact and sustainability report. We are incredibly inspired by the achievements of our employees globally. The report highlights initiative across key areas including inclusion, diversity and equity. Climate, packaging, social investments, responsible sources in Green Chemistry. I'm particularly proud of our support to employees globally who face financial hardships due to COVID-19. The ELC Cares Employee Relief Fund awarded nearly 14,000 grants and distributed nearly $8 million through June 30, 2021. Here, a few among the many other highlights of the report. We have continued to contribute to a low carbon future. For the second year in a row, we sourced 100% renewable electricity globally for our direct operations and achieved net-zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. The Company also made strong progress in its science-based targets for Scope 1 and 2 and made efforts toward meeting its Scope 3 science-based targets. We achieved our existing post-consumer recycled content goal ahead of schedule and announced a more ambitious goal to increase the amount of such material in our packages to 25% or more by the end of calendar year 2025.  We're also committed to reduce the amount of building petroleum plastic in our packaging to 50% or less by the end of calendar year 2030. On the last few earnings calls, I discussed actions we're taking to make more progress on our commitments for ratio equity, as well as women advancement and gender equality, which are reflected in the report. We also deepened our work by further aligning the strategy of the Estee Lauder companies charitable foundation to identify support programs at the intersection of climate, justice, human rights, and well-being with a focus on equity. Building upon our legacy of funding girls education and leadership programs. In the beginning of fiscal year 2022 and aligned with our social impact commitments, we were pleased to announce a 3-year partnership with Amanda Gorman, activists, award-winning writers in the youngest in our world poet U.S. history. The Estee Lauder companies will contribute $3 million over three years to support writing change, especially initiative to advance literally as a pathway to a quality access and social change. In addition Mrs. Gorman will bring her voice of change to the Estee Lauder brand. The good thing our first campaign in the second half of this fiscal year. In closing, we delivered outstanding performance to begin the new fiscal year amid the volatility, and variability of the pandemic. While continuing to invest in sustainable long-term growth drivers, we are focusing on fundamental capabilities for product quality and the consumer - centric elements of acquisition, engagement, and high-touch experiences and services.  We are doing this while improving our cost structure, diversifying our portfolio and its distribution, investing behind the best growth opportunities, and leaving our values. Our confidence in the long-term growth opportunities for global prestige beauty and our Company is reflected in the announcement today to raise the quarterly dividend. I'm forever grateful to the grace, wisdom, and ingenuity of our employees globally, while making us a stronger Company each and every day. I will now turn the call over to Tracey. Just -- can I add that there's also MAC has been a good start in the Ulta target experience. It's a great start in the preparation of the holiday season. And the brand is doing very well online and is one of the brands that is benefiting from the service acceleration online both in U.S. and EMEA. So overall, very good progress from MAC obviously, as you would expect in the contest of the makeup acceleration for consumers in general. So, I think there are 2 question. So what we see online? Obviously, online is doing pretty well on a two-year stack, we've doubled it. And so it's a very strong acceleration versus two years. And we see the progress to continue and the growth to continues. Obviously, in the moment where there was the opening of brick-and-mortar, the amount of growth online slow down, but the continuous growth is what is really encouraging. So the most important part of your question, what happened to the consumer's behavior. So what we saw during COVID, that the consumers that were already online before, like younger consumer, continue to be online even more intensively. But  many new consumers, they just appeared online during the COVID. They were more the ageless consumer, the more adults consumers. Now, this consumer really enjoyed so they are staying online and so that's what showed that the online continues to grow even when brick-and-mortar open side. But obviously, the 2 channels growth get re-balanced in this situation. So very optimistic for online. The other thing that the online continues to grow is that there are very different channels with different level of growth and we are growing in every single channel. We are growing in 3PP. We are growing in brand.com. We are growing in retail account. We're growing in the pure place and these are very different by region because in every region, one of this channel is stronger than the others. The combination of the global online growth is continuing to be pretty exciting. And we count to this to continue, even when brick-and-mortar will be fully, fully recovered. And as a result, we have reached already 28% of our business in online and this will gradually continue to grow over time. So very strong. In terms of -- sorry, your second question, because it was a separate question on consumer behaviors in Asia. Could you repeat it? I think the exploration of newness in the world of beauty will continuous, will never stop. And personally, I don't have any data points that suggest was dependent on COVID. The disploration is not only by our new brands, but this disploration is about the newness of the existing brands. In fact, our percentage on newness continues to be very, very high and our innovation program continues to be super exciting. We are continued to be in the 30% of new products per year, which is extraordinary and has been a huge progress in the last years. So we continue to see consumers to be interested in innovation, and we continue to make our innovation program one of the best drivers of growth globally. Good morning. Yeah. No, we see obviously a very strong fragrance mascot and we see great growth in every single regions. So it's good. We see particularly strong fragrance traction in the high-end fragrances, in what we call the luxury artisan  of our portfolio. This is really a stand, so brands like Jo Malone, Tom Ford, Le Labo, Kilian, Frederic Malle. And -- and we believe this will continue. This is a trend we have identified some years ago and we have focused the growth of our portfolio and our innovation on this kind of highly sophisticated fragrance experiences. And while we have seen that the -- during COVID that this trend is accelerated, the consumers are even more interested. The other interesting thing is during COVID, the element of our fragrance brands that were, for example, home, like candles or personal cleansing, or pampering parts of the lineup beyond the fragrance also was accelerating, and this acceleration continues. So the positives that consumer have learned, also the possibility of the pampering in-house element of products that these brands provide, they continue to buy them also after the COVID period or this COVID thing. So the entire fragrance brands are strong. The fragrance category is strong. And we expect to have a good holiday season. In this area, we expect continuous growth over time. I mean, we achieved double-digit growth in China this quarter and some very strong double-digits also on a 2 or 3 years stacked basis. So despite the restrictions they were also in July and August. So the Chinese consumer are really strong and we are serving them. We also with a variety of locations, meaning in every channel we see the growth online, we see the growth in brick-and-mortar. We see the growth in high-end and, and our key idea is to serve the Chinese consumers wherever they are, and to serve them in the best possible way. So we manage this with agility. And depending what is the commercial model that is emerging in China, we focused more on 1 channel , also depending by the season and by the moment. Also screen -- skin care, which I think is a great sign of strength, skin care grew strong double-digit despite the very tough comparison with the previous year. While in our case, we launched the Advanced Night Repair relaunch.  So it was a very big innovation in the base period. So brick-and-mortar in China also saw very strong growth, and our business online grew double digits. Despite the fact that in quarter 1, online is a bit normally sandwiched between the 6.18 big event and the 11.11 big event. But despite that, we grew double-digits. And the long term for demand on the market in closing, name ly the large and growing in the class with increasing spending per person, all these remain intact. And so the key idea is to be able to focus on the Chinese consumer, in whatever channel they choose to shop in depending on the moment to the year. And that's where we are doing, and that's why we remain very confident for the remaining of the fiscal year. Yeah. First of all, DECIEM is an extraordinary Company and The Ordinary is a brand with enormous success in traction. And so first of all, we are collaborating with the management team of DECIEM to continue building both The Ordinary and to continue building the overall DECIEM Company with their extraordinary incubation capability to have a new brand that they are creating for the future. So both of these activities -- so the big learning is obviously the ability to create vast interest, and the relationship between The Ordinary brand and the consumer is really extraordinary. Obviously, we can learn a lot from this. But apart from learning, we can support them in the implementation of the global commercial strategies in increasing the reach for the brand and obviously, in leveraging the powerful connection with the consumer in the best possible way, in supply chain, in R&D, in many, many areas.  So we can learn and we can support, and this exchange is proving to be very successful. Then on top of The Ordinary, there are other brands that building other ideas and creating for the future. So what we're learning is also the power of the creative incubation and the creation on new brands, and these will have an influence on our future ability to continue developing brands. And definitely, we will leverage the strengths of these in most in this area. Keep in mind that in China, our most distributed brand, which is Estee Lauder in 140 cities where today with a strong social media and with the strong aspiration of values of our brand. As we speak, we can -- we are demand in more than 700 cities. So there are many, many consumers in China they can only buy either online or traveling and traveling domestically today. And historically Kelly also traveling internationally. And so the -- it is just the market, commercially, the market is designed to have a very limited  between the Mainland, China, and the Hainan service. An enormous amount of consumer that comes also from Tier 3, Tier 4 cities, areas where there is not a lot of brick-and-mortar distribution. And so Hainan cannot track this consumer in this moment, also is a place where people go for holidays, as part of these holiday's this -- there is a lot of the pleasure of shopping, the pleasure of discovery.  The business in China is proving to be a great trial builder, more than an cannibalizing business and is building trial of people that otherwise would not be able to try our problem, then we'll repurchase them. We'll repurchase them maybe again in the future travel, but most of the times in their everyday lives in Mainland China. So obviously, there is commercial competition. The market is becoming very competitive. There is a lot of players. And commercially, there is that will continue to be intense competition. But there is -- every channel serves, frankly, a very different role. And so our strategy is to be able to leverage each one of these channel in the best possible way. We are maximizing the coverage and the service to the total consumers in China that are interested in Beauty, and over time to be able to better differentiate the scope of the channels and how the consumer will be served by the different channels.  Last thing I want to say, Hainan had at least the last number I've seen over the 80 million visitors in the last year. So if you think that Hainan serves the entire middle class because it's domestic travel. You don't need to have a passport. So today, in our knowledge, about 12% of Chinese consumer at the task force, even when international travel will restart. There will be even limited cannibalization versus international travel, because China would serve many consumers that do not plan to travel internationally. So we are very positive on the long term and very positive on the ability to serve the consumers using different channels, which is our strategy. I just wanted to add that our North America growth discourse, which has been extraordinary, is the result of manufacturers. It's definitely not yet the impact of Ulta, Target, or Sephora, or Kohl's. That was just at the beginning and only in the last months of the quarter. So it's the result of many other very positive signs. Also, we have been getting shares with categories during the quarter in Clinique, in MAC, in La Mer, in Bobbi, in Tom Ford, in Jo Malone, so it's a very broad growth across. We are really ready with our innovation with the strong marketing programs. We had anticipated they come back for makeup. We have strengthened our program in what we call the Makeup Renaissance in anticipation on the return to back-to-school or back to work. And we had amazing programs so that we have had the obviously the ordinary, which is the number four brand in a skincare in prestige U.S. to our portfolio. So is a combination of factors of improvement of the strategy and improvement of the execution in our North America organization. So it's a refilled quarter, and we do expect the Ulta Target and Sephora to contribute more in the next quarters, or was not the key contributing factor in quarter one."

            "name": "Tracey Travis",
            "content": "Thank you, Fabrizio and hello everyone. We're off to an outstanding start with first quarter net sales growing 18% organically driven by the Nascent recovery in the Americas and EMEA during the quarter compared to a more difficult environment in the prior year. Global logistic constraints caused some retailers, primarily in North America, to order earlier to ensure popular sets and products would be on counter for Holidays. We estimate that this contributed approximately 1.5 points to our first-quarter sales growth that otherwise would have occurred in the second quarter. The inclusion of sales from the May 2021 DECIEM investments added approximately 3 points to reported net sales, growth and currency added just over 2 points. From a geographic standpoint, organic net sales in the Americas climbed 27% as COVID restrictions eased throughout the region. Brick-and-mortar retail grew sharply across all formats compared to the prior year period when many stores were temporarily shutdown. Distribution and Kohl's with Sephora and in target with Ulta Beauty, began its phased roll-out to initial stores and online in mid August with minimal impact on net sales growth for the quarter. With the strong resurgence of Brick-and-mortar traffic online, organic sales growth in the Americas declined single-digit against the sharp increase last year, while organic online penetration remains solid at 31% of sales. The inclusion of sales from DECIEM added about 9 points to the overall reported growth in the region.  In our Europe, the Middle East, and Africa region, organic net sales rose 19% with virtually every market contributing to growth led by the emerging markets in the Middle East, Turkey, and Russia, as well as the U.K. Most markets throughout the regions saw COVID restrictions lifted and some tourism resume during the peak summer months. By channel, the region saw more balance between brick-and-mortar and online growth. All major categories grew this quarter and the region saw the strongest growth in fragrance and makeup as social occasions increased. Our global travel retail business grew double-digit as China and Korea continued to be strong. Internal travel restrictions during the quarter in China slowed Hainan sales temporarily, but restrictions lifted in early September and traffic rebounded. Retailers also responded to the August dip by driving post-travel consumption online. Summer holiday travel in Europe and the Americas ticked up but international travels still reached only 40% of pre-COVID levels. In our Asia-Pacific region, organic net sales rose 10% and driven by Greater China and Korea. The region overall experienced higher levels of COVID lockdowns this quarter, compared to last year's quarter due to the rise of the Delta variant, although online remains strong.  Sales growth in Mainland, China was somewhat slower due to COVID restrictions during July and August and the pace of online sales growth slowed following the successful 6-18 programs last quarter, and in anticipation of the 11.11 Shopping Festival. As we've mentioned before, these key shopping moments have created some additional seasonality in our business in this region. More than half of our brands, and virtually all channels rose double-digit in Mainland China. Hong Kong and Macau were bright spots this quarter. They benefited from strong new product launches from La Mer and Jo Malone and successful marketing campaigns from several other brands. From a category perspective, net sales growth in fragrance jumped nearly 50%. Virtually every brand that participates in the category contributed to growth with exceptional double-digit increases from Tom Ford Beauty, Jo Malone London, and La LeBeau. Perfumes and colognes led the category growth and bath, body and home fragrances continued to perform well. Net sales in makeup rose 18% as markets in the Americas and Europe began to recover from COVID shutdowns. We are encouraged by the sequential improvement in makeup versus pre - COVID level. However, makeup sales in the quarter was still 19% below 2 years ago. Nonetheless, Estee Lauder foundations continued to resonate strongly with consumers, and MAC leaned into the makeup recovery with a number of fun and compelling campaign. Skin care sales remained strong during the quarter. Organic net sales grew 12% and the inclusion of sales from DECIEM added 6 percentage points to reported growth. Nearly all of our skincare brands contributed to growth, although Estee Lauder had a tough comparison with the prior year launch of its improved Advanced Night Repair serum. Our hair care net sales rose 8% as traffic in salons and stores in the U.S. and Europe began to return. Both Aveda and Bumble and bumble saw growth in hair products as well as continued strength from innovation. Our gross margin declined 100 basis points compared to the first quarter last year. The positive impacts from strategic pricing and currency were more than offset by higher obsolescence costs for both basic and holiday product sets and the inclusion of Visium. Operating expenses decreased 240 basis points as a percent of sales. Our strong sales growth was partly due to earlier orders from some North America retailers concerned about logistics constraints and costs related to these sales are expected to be incurred in our second quarter. We do continue to manage costs with agility, realizing savings from our cost initiatives while also investing to support a continued brick-and-mortar recovery, as well as our strategic initiatives. Our operating income rose 32% to $941 million, and our operating margin rose 140 basis points to 21.4% in the quarter. Diluted EPS of a $1.89 increased 31% compared to the prior year. During the quarter, we used 81 million in net cash flows from operating activities, which was below the prior year. This reflects a more normalized first quarter where we typically have seasonally higher working capital needs. We invested $205 million in capital expenditures as we ramped up our investment to build the new manufacturing facility in Japan, and we returned $749 million in cash to stockholders through both share repurchases and dividends. We also announced this morning, an increase in our quarterly dividend. Now let's turn to our outlook. We are encouraged by the green shoots we are seeing around the world even in the context of an environment of increased volatility. Our strong performance reflects our ability to navigate through the volatility while leveraging our multiple engines of growth. At the same time, we are mindful that recovery is tenuous and likely to be uneven. Nevertheless, we are cautiously optimistic in our assumption for fiscal 2022 remain consistent. We continue to expect an emerging Renaissance in the makeup category as restrictions are safely lifted and social occasions increase. We welcome the resumption of some travel in the Americas and EMEA in the first quarter. And as intercontinental restrictions are lifted, we expect international passenger traffic to build toward the end of the fiscal year. We began taking strategic pricing actions in July and overall, pricing is expected to add at least 3 points of growth, helping to offset inflationary pressures. On the cost side, we plan to continue to increase advertising to support our brands and drive traffic in all channels. Selling costs are expected to rise to support the reopening of brick-and-mortar retail. We also continue to invest behind key strategic capabilities like data analytics, innovation, technology, and sustainability initiatives. As you are all aware, global supply chains are being strained by COVID and it's related effects in some markets, resulting in port congestion, higher fuel costs, and labor shortages at a time when demand for goods is rising. This is causing us to experience inflation in freight and procurement, which we expect to impact our cost of goods and operating expenses beginning next quarter. Based on what we see through October, the expected benefit of pricing combined with good cost discipline elsewhere, are enabling us to maintain our expectations for the year. For the full fiscal year, organic net sales are forecasted to grow 9% to 12%. Based on rates of 1.163 for the euro, 1.351 for the pound, and 6.471 for the Chinese yuan, we expect currency translation to be negligible for the full fiscal year. This range excludes approximately 3 points from acquisitions, divestitures, and brand closures, primarily the inclusion of DECIEM. Diluted EPS is expected to range between 723 and 738 before restructuring another charges. This includes approximately $0.04 of accretion from currency translation and $0.03 accretion from DECIEM. In constant currency, we expect EPS to rise 11% to 14%. At this time we expect organic sales for our second quarter to rise 8% to 10%. The net incremental sales from acquisitions, divestitures, and brand closures are expected to add about 3 points to reported growth, and currency is forecasted to be neutral.  Operating expenses are expected to rise in the second quarter as we support holiday activations and the continued recovery of brick-and-mortar retail around the world. Additionally, the prior-year quarter included some benefit of government subsidies which are not anticipated in the current year quarter. We expect second quarter EPS of $2.51 to $2.61. Both currency and the inclusion of DECIEM are expected to be immaterial to EPS. Notably, our EPS forecast also reflects a 23% tax rate compared to 15.9% in the prior year when we benefited from certain one-time line up In closing, we are pleased with the terrific start to the year and are proud of the continued efforts of our global team. We remain confident in our corporate strategy with its multiple growth engines to drive sustainable, profitable growth. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time. Yeah. Hi, Erinn. We are seeing some supply chain impact as I said in our prepared remarks. We have experienced some airfreight and we have experienced some delays, but by and large, we're in very good shape for holiday. Our holiday sets, we had anticipated some of the supply chain challenges earlier in the year when clearly our supply chain -- and more publicly, there were discussions about supply chain challenges. And so we did order some products early, we produce some products early, and we landed many of our gift sets early. And that's set us up pretty well for Q2. We are experiencing some inflation in transport, we're managing it as best we can. One of the things that certainly we have the benefit of is we are a luxury Company, so we do have pricing power, and we have pricing power not only in our inline products, but also in our innovation as well. So we do have the opportunity and have taken the opportunity to offset some of the cost inflation with some of the pricing that we've taken this year. Yeah. Hi, Lauren. So you stated out, and at the very beginning, what -- your question is about what specifically? Oh, MAC, yeah. Yeah, no. As we announced last year in our post COVID acceleration program, we did take the opportunity last year to close some stores and some additional stores will close this year. And not only freestanding stores, but there are some counters as well that MAC has pulled that up. We were encouraged at the end of last year and encouraged through the first quarter with MAC performance in both the Americas. So both North America, as well as Latin America, and also EMEA. So we really -- with return to brick-and-mortar, as we had indicated before, we saw a higher productivity of the remaining brick-and-mortar doors that we had open, and we saw a bit of softness more in North America than in EMEA, but a bit of softness in online as traffic return to brick-and-mortar. We think that will normalize out a bit in Q2 and we will see a bit more balanced, but as I think all of us can imagine, I think consumers were very excited about going back to brick-and-mortar stores in markets where restrictions were lifted, and people felt more comfortable going out and socializing. Good morning. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks, Dara. In terms of -- we are encouraged obviously, as we should be by our Q1 performance. We're still only at quarter end, as you mentioned, as you mentioned it. We did have some early shipments in the quarter that obviously came out of the second quarter. So some of the growth, as we mentioned, about 1.5 was related to that. But as we look at the balance of the year, we are -- also while we're seeing encouragement, there's still a lot of volatility in the market. We did have some markets unexpectedly that were shut down in the first quarter. We are still managing through this pandemic.  And so we are -- we believe that certainly as you look at Q2 on a 2-year stock basis, it is -- and really versus pre-pandemic, it's really quite strong. And again, you're seeing some of the seasonality related to 11-11, continue to impact Q1, and that's reflected in the -- Q2, and that's reflected in the guidance that we've provided. But we feel that the guidance that we've given for the year is incredibly strong. The only difference between the guidance that we gave last time and this time, is currency. Our outlook on currency is a bit less. So that's the 1 point change in the guidance that you see. And then from a reported EPS standpoint, our guidance actually on a constant currency basis has improved quite a bit.  We -- I would say we are seeing green shoots, we are expressing confidence in the guidance that we are providing quite a bit when you actually look at it from an EPS standpoint, even with all of the things that we're navigating through as it relates to transport, etc. And that goes to the choices that we're making as an organization in terms of where to invest and where not to invest, along with the pricing actions that we're taking as well. Yeah. Now, so, Steve, in terms of the early shipments, obviously, our larger brands would have comprised most of the larger -- most of the sales dollar volume in terms of those shipments, but it was really across the board. And again, both we and our retailers wanted to make sure that we had our holiday programs, as well as some of our basic product in-store, recognizing the severe constraint that is being projected as it relates to transport during this holiday season. So we feel very good about that. In terms of Asia-Pacific inclusive of China, but other markets as well. We did see some intermittent shutdowns in Asia and that did include some traffic to Hainan being a bit curtailed in the July and August time frame and a bit into the early part of September. We saw, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, Hainan picked up quite a bit when those travel restrictions were lifted almost immediately. That is a positive sign and we are still quite encouraged with respect to China and the performance that we expect to see certainly for the balance of the year, both in China and Mainland, China and with Chinese consumers, wherever they shop. And Andrea as it relates to the rest of APAC, we are expecting a pickup in the second quarter, so we are not anticipating as many of the restrictions to be in place in the rest of APAC that we saw in Q1. Thanks, Wendy. In terms of La Mer, La Mer is growing in pretty much every market. It's incredibly strong, the brand does a fantastic job of innovating and so we're seeing growth from both new innovation as well as a continued expansion of new consumers with some of the strategies that the brand is deploying. And we see very high loyalty and repeat with La Mer, it is all around even during this pandemic, it has been one of the constants in terms of the performance in our portfolio and the La Mer team is just an absolute fantastic team. So the brand is doing incredibly well. As it relates to Kohl's and Target and also within target and Sephora within Kohl. We have seeded the initial doors.  We certainly expect during the upcoming holiday season that we will see increased growth, obviously, in contribution from the distribution that we have, and we're pleased thus far with the partnership. We're seeing more skin care growth and than makeup at the moment. But again, I expect that we will certainly with some of the strong gift programs that our makeup brands have, we expect that we'll see more makeup growth in the second quarter. I think this quarter really represents the diversification that we have within the business that we've talked about. And certainly the North America performance to Fabrizio's point represents that as well."

For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Rainey Mancini.\nRainey Mancini: Hello. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges and adjustments disclosed in our press release. Unless otherwise stated, all organic net sales growth also excludes the non-comparable impacts of acquisitions, divestitures, brand closures, and the impact of foreign currency translation. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our press release and on the Investors section of our website. As a reminder, references to online sales include sales we make directly to our consumers through brand.com sites and through third-party platforms. It also includes estimated sales of our products through our retailers' websites. During the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourselves to one question, so we can respond to all of you within the time scheduled for this call. And now I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio.\nFabrizio Freda: Thank you, Rainey, and hello to everyone. We appreciate you joining us to discuss our fiscal year 2023 results and outlook. Let me begin with the fourth quarter. We delivered an organic sales increase of 4%, achieving a return to growth for the quarter as expected. Momentum continued in the markets of EMEA and Latin America and accelerated in Asia Pacific, where organic sales growth improved from 7% in the third quarter to 36% in the fourth quarter, led by mainland China and Hong Kong SAR. Looking at the full year, while demand for our business is still strong with retail sales brought up mid-single digit globally, organic sales declined 6%. We delivered impressive double digit growth in the markets of EMEA and return to growth in Asia Pacific, while the Americas held steady. These gains across the markets of EMEA and Asia Pacific were more than offset by Asia travel retail, given the prolonged and complex recovery from the pandemic, as we have discussed in our previous earning calls. Indeed, our global travel retail business decreased 34% organically in fiscal year 2023, solely driven by Asia travel retail. Our travel retail business in EMEA and the Americas soared, and our investment in activation and in store beauty advisor drove strong performance as passenger traffic increased. The rest of our business in total rose 5% organically as growth accelerated from 10% in the third quarter to 17% in fourth quarter. The challenges in Asia travel retail disproportionately pressured skin care, which is our highest margin category. Compounding matters the leverage was pronounced as the lower level of sales consided with the elevated strategic investment in manufacturing and R&D capabilities, as well as information technology for our online business and to support our expanding supply chain globally. All told, our adjusted operating margin contracted meaningfully in fiscal year 2023 to 11.4%, modestly better than we expected in the revised outlook we offered in May. During fiscal year 2023, we continued to make progress on our sustainability goals and commitments. For our packaging goals, for instance, we had now advanced from 51% of our packaging being recyclable, refillable, reusable, recycled or recoverable in fiscal year '19 to over 70% in fiscal year 2023. As well, we are on track to maintain our status of 100% renewable electricity and Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon neutrality. We are proud to have been recognized by CDP for our continued commitment to disclose our environmental impact as reflected in our CDP climate, water and forest disclosure scores for 2022. Most notably, we achieved an A minis for our climate change disclosures, and we earned a place in the prestigious A List for water, improving our score over 2021. Looking ahead, for Asia travel retail the pressure in Hainan intensified over the course of the fourth quarter. In May and June, retail sales trends deteriorated and turned steeply negative, following the enforcement actions to control the [indiscernible] activity. The implication of these are favorable for sustainable long-term growth, but certainly create significant short-term headwinds through the transition. As we embark on fiscal year 2024, we have four strategic imperatives: drive momentum where our business is driving; reaccelerate growth in the United States; capture demand for the returning individual travel in Asia travel retail; and begin to rebuild our profitability. For fiscal year 2024, we expect to return to full year organic sales growth and margin expansion with organic sales rising 6% to 8% and adjusted operating margin improving sequentially throughout the year. Our fiscal year 2024 action plan, where we expect to again increase our investment in advertising as a percentage of sales, will also set the stage for a stronger fiscal year 2025 acceleration. One of our greatest strengths to leverage in our return to top and bottom line growth is our diverse portfolio of nearly 25 brands. Sitting at the top are our $4 billion plus brands of Clinique, Est\u00e9e Lauder, La Mer and M.A.C, each a winner in its own right. M.A.C, the world's biggest prestige makeup brand, was our best-performing brand across the entire portfolio in fiscal year 2023. Its unrivaled artistry, hero products, strong earned media value ranking and breakthrough innovation of the Hyper Real franchisee in skincare drove excellent results. For fiscal year 2024, the brand is on the cusp of a big launch in makeup as M.A.C aims to extend its winning streak in innovation. Indeed, all our billion-dollar-plus brands have exciting newness ahead in both product and commercial innovation as they leverage their brand equity, scale and omnichannel beauty advisors. Clinique, the number one prestige skincare brand in the US, pioneered dermatologists develop products when it was founded in 1968. The brand is deepening its connections with dermatologists, adding powerful, instant and dermatologist-level claims, doubling down in its unique safety philosophy and activating more derm education on TikTok. And later this month, Clinique will elevate its equity in the aging with the breakthrough launch of Smart Clinical Repair Lifting Face and Neck Cream, a new dermatologist-tested formula. Est\u00e9e Lauder, among the biggest prestige brands globally is extending its world-renowned Advanced Night Repair franchise with the launch of Rescue Solution for sensitive skin and the brands luxury-oriented Re-Nutriv franchise has a rich innovation program across makeup and skincare. La Mer, the global leader in luxury skincare grew double-digit in Asia Pacific in fiscal year 2023 and aims to accelerate its growth with the upcoming launch of the Lifting Firming Serum. This launch capitalizes on La Mer successfully upgraded the moisturizer soft cream as both bring advanced benefit in antiaging efficacy. Moreover, La Mer is introducing new regiments focused on the power of its iconic Miracle Broth to capitalize on the trend of night regimens. In fiscal year 2024. This esteemed tier of billion-dollar-plus brands is set to expand its brands count by 50%, as we expect Jo Malone London and TOM FORD to cross the sales threshold. These two brands have excelled over the last decade and are ideally positioned for the next decade given their positioning in the fast-growing segment of luxury and artisanal fragrance. For TOM FORD, which optimized luxury glamour, fiscal year 2023 was monumental. We are thrilled to have acquired the brand after having collaborated to create TOM FORD for over 15 years. This acquisition is a central building block to realize our aspirations in high-growth luxury ecotour beauty. Moreover, the brand sales rose strong double-digits organically in fragrance for the fiscal year. The breadth of this performance was stunning as over 30 markets grew double digits. The strengths of its hero products and innovation proven a powerful combination with new and excite -- and existing consumers. And TOM FORD Enticing Cafe Rose launch to begin fiscal year 2024. In makeup, TOM FORD delivered double-digit organic sales growth in Asia Pacific and the markets in EMEA, driven by excellent performance in lips. Among our other scaling brands or those with sales between $500 million and $1 billion, we are encouraged by their progress in fiscal year 2023. For Bobbi Brown Cosmetics, the brand continued to complement its expanding makeup business with strong growth in skincare, while Aveda executed on its global ambition with a successful launch in mainland China. The Ordinary graduated into our tier of scale brands as double-digit sales growth propelled it well above $500 million. The brand's list of achievements for the year is long, indeed from success in its hero product to a step change in the contribution, to sales from innovation to doubling its TikTok followers, to strong share gains in prestige skincare in the U.S. and Western Europe, The Ordinary proved its high-performance ingredient led products are well loved. And we believe it is just getting started in realizing its global potential. Looking across our developing brands in which we strategically invest to realize the scaly brands of the future. Le Labo, KILIAN PARIS and Editions de Parfums, Frederic Malle each achieved the double-digit organic sales growth in fiscal year 2023 to continue their winning streaks. Impressively, over the last five years, these three brands have delivered over 30% compound annual growth, demonstrating brand-building acumen. At this time next year, we will be on the verge of launching Balmain Beauty with the namesake luxury fashion house. Our collaboration with Balmain has been exceptional and we cannot wait to introduce this new luxury beauty brand to the world. For our brand portfolio, we have positioned ourselves to take advantage of the efficiency, the effectiveness that will be enabled by generative AI. Furthermore, creating high-quality, high-performing products is in our DNA. Innovation has long served as a catalyst for growth, once again represented over 25% of our sales in fiscal year 2023. We have a rich pipeline on newness slated for fiscal year 2024 and it gets even bigger and stronger in fiscal year 2025 with more breakthrough innovation and expansion into widespread opportunities. Over the last few years, aligned with our innovation strategy, we have significantly increased the breadth, depth and diversity of our clinical studies for new and legacy products across categories to deliver impactful claims. This work, combined with our newly opened China Innovation Labs in Shanghai equips us with even greater capabilities to drive growth with consumers locally and around the world. For skincare, we have also significantly increased our scientific credentialing, demonstrated by an 85% increase in scientific advisory board members and third-party dermatologists and academic partners in the last two years. Last month at the World Congress of Dermatology in Singapore, we presented several studies for Clinique, Est\u00e9e Lauder and La Mer. This was a milestone moment for Est\u00e9e Lauder's Re-Nutriv franchise as our scientists unveiled our newness Breath Rule Longevity Age Reversal research on a global stage. Re-Nutriv has been continued to be a pioneer in this frontier of skin biology and will extend upon the recent success of Ultimate Diamond Transformative Brilliance Serum with compelling innovation this fiscal year. As we rebuild from the challenges of fiscal year 2023, we expect to leverage and stand upon these trends as we drive resilient growth. The opportunities ahead of us are significant as over 900 million people are expected to enter the middle class through 2030 and drive consumption as they seek the high-quality, strong efficacy and joy the prestige beauty affords. Our company has great confidence in the long-term development of China and we are proud of the very strong business we have built, led by our exceptional local team. The Chinese consumers continue to be the unrivaled number one growth drivers of our industry throughout the decade. We are pleased to have returned to organic sales growth in mainland China this fiscal year 2023, and to have expanded our prestige beauty share as the market gradually evolves in its recovery from the pandemic. Impressively, mainland China's fourth quarter organic sales were up double digit compared to both one and two years ago and we further expanded our prestige beauty share in the quarter. We made significant long-term investment in the market across fiscal year 2023. Beyond the opening of the China innovation lab in Shanghai and a new distribution center in Guangzhou, we launched Aveda to start the year and Le Labo to end the year. Aveda quickly captured up the ranks of prestige hair care, driven in part by its focus on the skinification of hair and high-performance product for scalp care. Le Labo initial freestanding store in Shanghai redefines experiential shopping, which makes it no surprise that it was the brand's top-performing store in the world in the month of June. We also invested in the vibrant opportunity in both brick-and-mortar and online, opening in seven new cities, expanding our online reach with Douyin and creating exceptional live streaming content which, as you know, is a game changer to excel in the market. Our online ecosystem continues to move from strength to strength across social and commerce, encompassing Timo, JD, WeChat, Red and Douyin, among others, driving our share gains for the fiscal quarter and year. Online in Mainland China performed exceptionally well every month in the fourth quarter to realize over 60% organic sales growth and expand online prestige beauty share by 2 points, owning to innovation, gifting campaigns and excellent execution. We capped the quarter success on 6/18, where our brand strength was broad-based. Est\u00e9e Lauder ranked number one in store live streaming prestige beauty on both Timo and Douyin, La Mer ranked the number one in luxe beauty on Timo for the third consecutive year, and Jo Malone London took the top spot on Timo and JD for luxe fragrances. From an organizational standpoint, mainland China and China travel retail have enhanced their capabilities for local coordination of go-to-market strategies and plans to maximize long-term value and support brand equity. The expected growth of the middle class around the world is exciting implication of our business, given also our vibrant emerging market portfolio. Indeed, in fiscal year 2023, our emerging markets delivered organic sales growth of 20% led by India, Brazil, Turkey and Thailand. India grew nearly 50% for the year, driven by excellent performance by our long-standing brands in the market and the very successful launch of The Ordinary. In North America, we are focused on reaccelerating growth to better capture prestige beauty opportunities in the region. Our multi-facet strategy plan includes launching a robust innovation pipeline, increasing engagement by brands on TikTok, accentuating our strength in luxury and artisanal fragrance and high-performance, ingredient-led skin care, and expand the brand reach in specialty multi, among other initiatives. And we are excited to extend our reach online as The Ordinary and Estee Lauder are soon to launch on TikTok Shop. Let me now turn to our profitability. We have identified four building blocks to progressively expand adjusted operating margin over the next few years. First, we are focused on optimizing mix by elevating luxury across brands, driven by consumer preferences, by expanding our direct-to-consumer ecosystem across brick-and-mortar and online. Second, we see many opportunities to maximize value through better price realization and accretive innovation. Third, we intend to increasingly leverage the strategic investment we have made over the last few years, most notably our new manufacturing facility in Japan and expanded online capabilities. Last, we believe we can unlock meaningful cost efficiencies in our value chain as we complete the rollout and adoption of our new integrated business planning process across the global operation and use generative AI to drive efficiencies. In closing, while we had a challenging year, we remain confident in our long-term strategy to realize the promising growth opportunity in global prestige beauty with our diversified portfolio brands, robust research and development capability and global reach. We are encouraged by the fundamental strength of our business in the markets of EMEA, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and are focused on our plans to recover growth in Asia travel retail and North America. For fiscal year 2024, we believe we are well positioned to return to organic sales growth and improve profitability. To our employees, you are the heart and the soul of our beautiful company, and I extend my deepest gratitude to your exceptional contribution and dedication. And now, I will turn the call over to Tracey.\nTracey Travis: Thank you, Fabrizio, and hello, everyone. While we certainly had many successes this past fiscal year, as you just heard, we are not satisfied with our fiscal 2023 financial results and are executing on our strategy to progressively rebuild the margin accretive areas of our business over the next few years, and leverage the investments we have made in manufacturing, distribution and technology capabilities. I will further address our plans when I discuss our fiscal 2024 outlook, but first, I will cover the fiscal 2023 fourth quarter and full year results. Our fourth quarter organic net sales increased 4% and earnings per share was $0.07. From a geographic standpoint, organic net sales grew in nearly all markets in both Asia Pacific and EMEA. This strong performance was partially offset by the ongoing challenges in our Asia travel retail business as we expected. Organic net sales in Asia Pacific rose 36%, reflecting double-digit growth in most markets, led by Mainland China and Hong Kong SAR, as they continue to progress in recovery with fewer COVID-related restrictions compared to the prior year. They also benefited from our successful brand innovations, new product launches, activation consumer -- of consumers and targeted consumer reach. In Mainland China, online realized over 30% organic growth and achieved approximately 60% penetration of sales in the quarter. In EMEA, organic net sales decreased 15%. The growth in nearly all markets and channels of distribution was more than offset by the performance of our Asia travel retail business. In Hainan, retail sales declined more than we expected in the quarter for the reasons Fabrizio mentioned. Excluding our travel retail business, net sales in both Makeup and Fragrance rose double digits in the region, benefiting from our strategic investments in advertising and promotional activities and the reestablishment of services in our stores. Organic net sales in the Americas were flat compared to last year. The strong double-digit increase in Latin America driven by the re-acceleration of Makeup growth in Brazil and Mexico, was offset by the decline in the United States due to the slower-than-expected pace of improvement in retail sales of several of our brands. Standout performance from The Ordinary continues to be a bright spot in the region for the many reasons that Fabrizio mentioned earlier. From a product category perspective, Makeup organic net sales increased 13%, reflecting growth in each region led by Asia Pacific as recovery continued and usage occasions increased. M.A.C, Est\u00e9e Lauder and TOM FORD drove growth, benefiting from investments in brand activations and increases in in-store staffing, the continued success of hero products, as well as new product launches. Fragrance organic net sales rose 12%, led by Le Labo and TOM FORD. Strong double-digit growth from Le Labo reflected increases in every region, momentum from our city exclusive special collection as well as growth from both existing and new points of distribution, including its expansion into mainland China. The increase from TOM FORD was fueled by strategic investments in advertising and promotional activities to support key shopping moments and brand activations. Organic net sales increased 6% in Hair Care and declined 3% in Skin Care. The pressures in our Asia travel retail business drove the Skin Care decline and were largely offset by the exceptional growth in the Asia/Pacific region. La Mer and Est\u00e9e Lauder declined, while The Ordinary, Bobbi Brown and M.A.C grew. M.A.C's growth was driven by the launch of the Hyper Real line of skin care products. Our gross margin declined 330 basis points compared to last year. This decline primarily reflects the under absorption of overhead in our plants due to the pull down of production throughout the year given our elevated inventory levels, as well as increased obsolescence charges. Operating expenses increased 70 basis points as a percent of sales, driven largely by the increase in advertising and promotional activities to support commercial activations in the quarter. Operating income declined 66% to $71 million, and our operating margin contracted 380 basis points to 2% in the quarter. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was a negative 17.9% compared to 14.2% last year due to a true-up in the quarter to reflect the final effective tax rate for the fiscal 2023 full year. Diluted EPS of $0.07 decreased 82% compared to last year. The impact from foreign currency translation and foreign currency transactions in key travel retail locations negatively impacted EPS by 7% and 9%, respectively. As we discussed in May, we completed the acquisition of the TOM FORD brand and the related intellectual property on April 28, paying approximately $2.3 billion. As a result of this acquisition, we entered into arrangements to license the TOM FORD trademark for eyewear to Marcolin and fashion to Zegna, which were the brand's prior licensees, creating a new revenue stream for the company. This acquisition had a dilutive impact to EPS of $0.01 including interest expense on our debt financing and reflecting savings from royalties we no longer have to pay. Shifting now to our full year results. This has certainly been a more volatile year than we anticipated. The challenges to our business in Asia travel retail and the United States as well as in the first half in Mainland China were partially offset by the progression of recovery everywhere else. In Mainland China, we continue to gain share in all major product categories, demonstrating the strong demand for our products, although we remain conscious of the evolving economic conditions. And overall, our investments in brand activations, increased in-store staffing, distribution expansion and online capabilities aided in the acceleration of recovery of sales which largely occurred in brick-and-mortar channels, excluding travel retail. Net sales growth was strong in brick-and-mortar, particularly in our freestanding stores and with our specialty multi-retailers. Global travel retail represented 20% of our reported sales in fiscal 2023. And online net sales, which were flat, represented 29% of our reported sales. Organic net sales fell 6%, primarily reflecting the challenges in our Asia travel retail business, which drove the declines in our EMEA region of 16% and in Skin Care of 14%. Nearly all other domestic markets in EMEA grew double digits. In Asia Pacific, net sales rose 4% as markets continue to progress in recovery throughout the year and benefited from investments in advertising and promotional activities, innovation and distribution expansion. Net sales in the Americas was flat compared to last year. Regarding categories, Fragrance net sales increased 14%, rising double digits in every geographic region and benefiting from the continued strength of hero products, successful innovation and distribution expansion, while Skin Care was more challenged in Asia travel retail and North America. Net sales grew 6% in Hair Care and was flat in Makeup. Our gross margin declined 440 basis points compared to last year, largely due to the slower-than-expected recovery in Asia travel retail. This includes higher obsolescence charges under absorption of overhead in our plants due to the pull-down of production throughout the year, given our higher inventory levels and less favorable category mix from our Skin Care mix. Operating expenses increased 390 basis points to 59.9% of sales, driven primarily by the decline in sales. Despite the pressures to sales, we sustained our investments to support markets where recovery was evident, including in areas such as advertising, promotion, innovation and selling, which collectively increased by 280 basis points as a percent of sales. Operating income declined 48% to $1.8 billion from $3.5 billion last year, and our operating margin contracted 830 basis points to 11.4% for the full year. In spite of the challenges that materially impacted our top line growth, we continued certain of our strategic investments important to support recovery and drive long-term sales growth and profitability. Our effective tax rate for the year was 26.5% compared to 21.3% last year, primarily reflecting the change in our geographical mix of earnings. Net sales declined 53% to $1.2 billion, and diluted EPS of $3.46 decreased 52% compared to last year, including the dilutive impacts from foreign currency translation and foreign currency transactions in key retail -- travel retail locations of 4% each. The acquisition of the TOM FORD brand was dilutive to EPS by $0.01. Now turning to our cash flows for the fiscal year. We generated $1.7 billion in net cash flows from operating activities compared to $3 billion last year. The decrease reflects lower net income, partially offset by lower working capital. We invested $1 billion in capital expenditures for supply chain enhancements, including our new manufacturing facility in Japan, consumer-facing capital, such as distribution expansion, investments in existing counters and online capabilities. We returned $1.2 billion in cash to stockholders through both dividends and share repurchases. Beginning in December of 2022, we suspended the repurchase of shares given the increase in debt due to the TOM FORD acquisition. Before I turn to our outlook for the full year, I want to take a moment to first address the recent cybersecurity incident we disclosed in July, involving an unauthorized third-party that gained access to some of our systems. After becoming aware of the incident, we proactively took down some of our systems. We began bringing our systems back online within days, which limited the incidents impact on the company's operations. Based on the information available to date, we believe the incident is contained. So now, let's turn to our outlook. This past year has undoubtedly been difficult, largely given the challenges we faced from increased market volatility in certain markets and the corresponding impact on our business. As we work to return to net sales growth in fiscal 2024, and over the next few years, progressively rebuild our operating margin, we remain focused on the transition of key areas of our business that have been disproportionately impacted by a slower pace of recovery, while also continuing to support growth in those areas where the recovery is more advanced. Over the next few years, mainland China and our travel retail business are expected to remain key drivers of our long-term profitable growth, and we anticipate continued growth with other areas of our business, including emerging markets globally, our more mature markets in the West and our direct-to-consumer channels globally. Assuming an eventual return to global prestige growth of 4% to 5%, we expect to return to more consistent compounded annual sales growth within our 6% to 8% long-term growth algorithm. Restoration of our operating margin is a top priority, though margin recovery will not happen in one year. We do, however, expect to progressively drive margin expansion as we return to profitable growth in Skin Care, improved Makeup margins and continue to drive our momentum in Fragrance, particularly our high-end artisanal fragrance brands. In addition, we plan to expand our gross margins through continuing to leverage our prestige pricing power, inclusive of driving additional accretive and compelling innovation, and improvements in operational efficiencies including enhanced supply demand planning and inventory optimization to reduce excess inventory and discount. We will begin to leverage the further regionalization of our manufacturing and distribution network in Asia to create greater inventory agility as demand fluctuates. Overall, beginning in fiscal 2024, we expect to recapture lost operating margin -- overall -- I'm sorry, beyond fiscal 2024, we expect to recapture lost operating margin at an accelerated pace by delivering annual margin expansion that is faster than our pre-pandemic historical average. This acceleration is expected to become more evident after the first quarter of fiscal 2024. So turning to fiscal 2024. We expect to continue to deliver net sales gains in the areas that performed well in 2023, including Asia Pacific, our Western and emerging European markets and Latin America, as they continue to progress in recovery from the pandemic, and benefit from the strategic actions we are taking to accelerate growth, including targeted consumer activation, compelling innovation and distribution enhancements that we drove throughout the pandemic period. We are, however, mindful of the macroeconomic headwinds that have emerged in Chinese economy. This has also resulted in our Asia travel retail business taking a bit longer than we originally anticipated to return to growth as travel and conversion remain pressured, which has been exacerbated by the sudden reduction of sales to non-travelers relative to the return of individual travelers in Korea and in Hainan. Correspondingly, inventory levels in the trade in Asia travel retail have improved at a slower pace. This will create greater pressure on our first half as we expect to continue to both adjust our shipments and increase our retail activation but also should yield sequential quarterly improvements throughout the year in both sales and margin. With that backdrop in mind, and using June 30 spot rates of $1.087 for the euro, $1.261 for the pound, $7.253 for the Chinese yuan and $13.21 for the Korean won, the full fiscal year organic net sales are forecasted to grow 6% to 8%. Royalty revenue from the acquisition of the TOM FORD brand is not expected to be material to net sales growth and will be excluded from organic net sales until the fourth quarter. The cybersecurity incident is also not expected to have a material impact to net sales. Currency translation is expected to dilute reported sales growth for the full fiscal year by 1 percentage point. We take the majority of our pricing actions at the beginning of our fiscal year. Our strategic price increases, including new products are expected to add approximately 5 points of growth. We expect the net benefits from strategic pricing, discount reductions and lower obsolescence to drive gross margin expansion for the full year, partially offset by manufacturing under absorption. We are aligning our production volumes to address a more variable demand environment with the intent to carry less inventory in our system and in the trade, while we continue to regionalize our supply base in Asia. However, we expect the lower mix of net sales from the highly margin-accretive areas of our business, including Asia travel retail and Skin Care, and the under-absorption of overhead to result in margin contraction in the first half of the year. This is expected to be more than offset by gross margin expansion in the second half of the year, given the greater mix of our travel retail business and Skin Care and less obsolescence charges compared to last year. Our full year operating margin is forecasted to be approximately 12% to 12.5%, a 60 to 110 basis point expansion from fiscal 2023. In fiscal 2024, we anticipate sequential margin expansion throughout the year driven by improvements in gross margin, while also maintaining go-to-market initiatives where appropriate. We expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 27%. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $3.50 and $3.75 before restructuring and other charges. The cybersecurity incident is expected to be approximately $0.07 dilutive to EPS. Our EPS range also includes approximately $0.11 of dilution from currency translation. In constant currency, we expect EPS to grow by approximately 4% to 12%. Net cash flows from operating activities are forecasted between $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion. Capital expenditures are planned at approximately 6% of forecasted net sales as we expect to fund new distribution and online capabilities, further enhance our manufacturing and distribution network, including the completion of our first manufacturing facility in Asia located in Japan to support the development of our Asia Pacific region. We also plan to continue investing in information technology to support our business. Our fiscal 2024 outlook also assumes flat quarterly dividend and the continued suspension of our share repurchases as we focus on deleveraging after the TOM FORD acquisition and prepare for the payment to purchase the remaining outstanding equity interest in DECIEM anticipated in May of 2024. For our first quarter, we currently expect organic net sales to fall 12% to 10%. The cybersecurity incident is not expected to have a material impact to net sales. At this time, we expect first quarter diluted EPS of negative $0.31 to negative $0.21 before restructuring and other charges. The cybersecurity incident is expected to be approximately $0.07 dilutive to EPS. This also includes approximately $0.02 of dilution from currency translation. In constant currency, we expect EPS of negative $0.29 to negative $0.19. I would like to close by thanking our employees for their dedication and focus during what turned out to be a challenging year. While we are not satisfied with our performance overall, we are certainly pleased by the results we were able to deliver in many recovering markets and brands. For fiscal 2024, we believe we have the right plans to navigate the environment as we gradually return to our historical cadence of long-term progressive and sustainable sales and profit growth, fueled by our highly desirable brand portfolio and our incredibly talented employees. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time.\nOperator: The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nStephen Powers: Yes. Hi. Good morning and thank you. I'd love it if you could address two topics, maybe one for you, Tracey, one for you, Fabrizio. First for Tracey, just -- appreciate your commentary at the end there, but just maybe a little bit more detail, if you could expand on the assumptions embedded in the 1Q step back and declines juxtaposed against what looks like a pretty rapid return to fairly -- to basically double-digit organic growth over the remainder of the year? Just little more color there, and I'm assuming a lot of the variability focused on Hainan, so maybe some expansion there? And then Fabrizio, I know the company had a leadership offsite in June. I'd love your perspective on how recent changes in the operating environment impacted points of emphasis of that meeting? And how the related discussion may have informed your 2024 outlook? Thank you very much.\nTracey Travis: Hi, Steve. So I'll start with your question regarding the cadence of the year. And you're right, there is a lot of variability. If I would take you back to the first and second quarter of last year, you'll recall that while we had some disruption in Hainan, we did have -- we still had some business in Hainan. We also had business in Korea. So our travel retail percent of mix was higher in the first half of last year in addition to, obviously, the recovery that we were seeing in the EMEA and Americas regions in terms of the airports in those regions. In the second half of the year, then obviously, we saw the challenges that we've called out certainly in the last call as it relates to both Korea, and obviously what Fabrizio talked about in the fourth quarter as it relates to Hainan. We have a bit of a reverse situation as we're anniversarying those impacts this year. So with what happened in the May, June time frame in Hainan, we are seeing traffic and less conversion in Hainan than we saw previously. That is impacting our Q1 certainly compared to last year when we saw more traffic and more conversion in Hainan and in Korea. That gets a bit better in Q2, as we anniversary some of the softness that began to materialize in Q2 last year in those two areas. And then we're anniversarying, obviously, the softness that we experienced in the second half of our fiscal 2023 in fiscal 2024. So we are expecting that travel retail will get progressively better in the third and fourth quarter, certainly compared to the third and fourth quarter we had this year. Part of that, Steve, is obviously the destocking that we are doing. So in Hainan, obviously, with the sudden change in Daigou, that is making the retail traffic slower than what we had anticipated. And as a result of that, it's changing our view on the shipments that we will need for Hainan in the first quarter and certainly a bit into the second quarter. So I hope that helps in terms of some of the cadence of what we're experiencing and why the margin differential is so great. As you know, Travel Retail certainly benefits from a lot of the investment that we make in our markets like China and Korea and Japan, and all of the other markets not only in Asia, but in EMEA as well. And so it is a high margin -- higher margin channel for us for some of those reasons. Fabrizio?\nFabrizio Freda: Yes, on our leadership [Technical Difficulty] In June, we look at the strategy and the strategy of the future. And so what Tracey and I have presented in our prepared remarks are the results of also this work of reconfirming the strategy for 2024 for the next three years. And so, what are the key takeaways was your question. It's that, first of all, the market of global prestige beauty continue to be very attractive and will continue to be more and more attractive in the future. And our strategy is, as I explained in the prepared remarks, is now focused on continue building on our strengths and continue building the areas where we are really delivering great results and supporting this growth. At the same time, continue reinforcing the health of our brands and the innovation of our brands and refocusing resources and activities in all these areas. And then fix the TR issue, including a much better coordination between TR organization in China and China region organization in mainland, and the plans for the North America acceleration and to continue winning emerging markets. By the way, in the last quarter we're astonishing with a 38% growth. And so, deploying the resources, the capabilities, the skills to continue doing this in the key emerging markets, I have to say, the excitement in India is particularly high. And so, in summary, the leadership of the company has agreed and allocated resources and skills on the key components of the strategy for the next three years, which is, leverage the growth of the market and obviously, continue to build our strengths, fix our issues, and most importantly, support the profit recovery plan that again, we explained in the prepared remarks, in every single aspect at the accelerated pace of profit recovery, as Tracey just explained.\nOperator: The next question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDara Mohsenian: Hi, guys. So two part question on my end that I think builds on that answer, Fabrizio. Some fairly unique circumstances in the past year, both externally and internally that caused weaker results than you originally expected. That's uncharacteristic versus a longer-term track record. So just wanted to get your perspective on, A, if you think you have good visibility on this fiscal 2024 earnings guidance? How much investment are you assuming incrementally to drive a recovery post 2024? And then B, perhaps, Tracey, you gave us some detail on margin expectations. But how should we think about sort of the ability to get back to peak historical margins at some point over the next few years? And how quickly we might see margin recovery relative to this 2024 base just as we think about those four building blocks you mentioned from here? Thanks.\nFabrizio Freda: Yes. In terms of the visibility to the guidance, obviously, Tracey and I have given you this guidance, we believe that that's the -- in this moment, is the project of the business. So we have visibility and clarity in terms of our plans. I want, however, to underline that the volatility externally remain very, very high, particularly the volatility in the Chinese market, the volatility in the transition in the TR market from the Daigou to the regular travelers, the transition to the groups traveling. They've just been announced in turn are low. The transition, obviously, on the judgment of what the economy recovery will be globally, particularly in the post-pandemic environment, particularly how the economy in China will evolve. So all these external elements are part, obviously our assumptions of these external elements are part of our guidance. And in the press release, we made an effort to explain all our assumptions in the guidance. And then in terms of our internal plans and in term of the continued leveraging our current trends on the things which are working, we are pretty confident. The real question is, how fast we will be fixing the issues? But the strengths of the current trends of what is working are frankly more easy to predict and to forecast. So net, we believe in our guidance, but will be obviously volatility to be managed in the context of the future, and you will see as much as we will see the evolution in these areas. And then Tracey?\nTracey Travis: Yes, Dara. So I mean, certainly, we are encouraged by some of the signs we see -- recent signs that we see in terms of recovery. The return of travelers. We are, as Fabrizio mentioned, in terms of our fiscal 2024, taking actions to pretty dramatically pull back on some of our production so that we can get our inventory levels in line. And that will improve our margin. And I talked about in my prepared remarks that we're expecting gross margin recovery from some of those actions. As the situation normalizes and more travelers come back to travel retail, we are very confident in the strategy that we've had previously. Pre-pandemic, we were well on our way to those 20% operating margins. We don't see any reason why, once things normalize, that we can't get back to those 20% margins. Timing, I can't give you. I have said in our prepared remarks that we certainly, over the next few years, have plans to accelerate the margin progression well above our historical guidance of 50 basis points of margin improvement, and that does recommend -- that does represent a catch-up in margin progression and again, the strategies that we have to do that. But we are incredibly focused as an organization on returning to the margins that are more representative of our growth and our growth potential. I will also underscore the fact that we will not do that at the expense -- at the short-term expense of hurting our brands or hurting our markets that are in recovery, so it is a balancing act for us in terms of making sure we're making the right surgical investments that support not only the recovery and the markets that are further along in recovery, and as well as the long-term investments that we need to continue our growth algorithm of 6% to 8% top line growth and margin expansion. So again, I can't -- I know that's not the answer you're looking for in terms of you want a specific year and a specific number. And hopefully, we will be able to give that to you when we get a bit more clarity on more stabilization in the environment. But right now, you have the commitment of our entire organization that we recognize and have plans to accelerate our margin progression well beyond our historical levels in order to try to catch up.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nChris Carey: Hi. Good morning, everyone.\nFabrizio Freda: Good morning.\nChris Carey: So just one quick follow-up, and then a kind of a geographic question. Just on the China travel retail inventory dynamic. Fabrizio, you had mentioned that there's going to be greater collaboration between your teams in mainland and China travel retail. What's your confidence that some of the things that you may need to do to invest behind clearing your inventory won't impact brand equities and brand health? And I'm basically just trying to get a sense of the types of actions that you might be taking to clear inventory of -- consumption trends are as volatile as you say? And then just the geographic question would be, you had mentioned quite impressive growth rates in India, but also some underperformance in North America. Just over the next 12 months or longer, how do you think about this non-Asia market progressing, with perhaps to touch on what you see in some of these newer faster-growth markets? Thanks so much.\nFabrizio Freda: Yes. So I mean the -- in terms of the travel retail issue, you described it well. So we have increased the collaboration between the local team and the TR team just to have not only a better common decision-making on the key prioritization on the balancing act in order to create value and in order to continue to develop brand equities in a more coordinated way, but we also have more analytics to understand the channel dynamics, the pricing differentials and all the things. So we have created the base of much more information and timely information to take the right decisions in coordination. So this is a big improvement that should reduce the risk of non-coordinated actions in the future. Then the brand health that you also mentioned, I want to underline, the brand health is evident from the results in China. The brand health in -- with the Chinese consumers is really strong. And we have good market share results, which we already mentioned. The business has been growing 36% in the April, June quarter. The online market share has been extremely strong, 2 points extra of online market share. Our activation and consumer passion for our brands has been further confirmed by external research that our brands are at the top of the ranking of desirable brands in the market. So the brand equity, the brand health, also thanks the extraordinary work of our Mainland region, China Mainland region team is in good shape. And then you said correctly that we are very focused on the sell-through of the stocks, just to [indiscernible] the stocks. Obviously, as Tracey has explained, in May, June, Hainan was relatively weak, and that's why there is an impact also on the first quarter trend. But is -- but we are very focused on creating the retail activities that will facilitate the sell-through, and that's the key focus of the team. So in that area, we are very aligned, we have the organization resources squared, and we are focused on all these issues very squarely. On the second part of your question is, if I can give you light on the other markets. I mean the -- I hope that the report is very clear. The rest of our business, ex the TR Asia, has been growing in the last quarter, 17%. This is one of our fastest growth rate ever despite North America flat. And so we have really undergone strengths in all the rest of our business, which is the result of all the brand strengths which I explained in the prepared remarks. So we have four very big brands, well above $1 billion brands, and we will have two more. So to be clear, we will be a company by the end of 2024 with $6 billion brands, extraordinary scale in the global system and global reach. So this is behind our strengths. Then I wanted to underline the strengths of our innovation. Our innovation is strong. It's also in tough challenging year like 2023, remains at 25%. And the innovation pipeline for 2024, 2025 is very, very strong. Particularly in 2025, we have some extra wide spaces innovation, which are very promising. So this also will support the continuous strength of these other parts of the business -- other regions, as you mentioned. And then finally, the execution in this region has been stepping up because we explained that as the recovery from the pandemic progress, our ability to execute in the post-pandemic world has been developed and is getting better and better month after month. So in the regions which have been faster in the post-pandemic development, we have been faster in recovering great execution and great results, so this will continue to progress in 2024. So we have good confidence on that. On the U.S. where, on the contrary, we said there is work to be done, the team is very focused on doing this work. We have a very clear plan. Again, I summarized them in the prepared remarks, but to go back to them, our strategy in rebuilding the North America growth is really various [indiscernible] four big building blocks. The first one is a very rich pipeline of newness, which is later in 2024 and further reinforced in 2025, focus on breakthrough innovation on new claims that will help also unlocking the consumers in online, and especially multi more aggressively. We are driving higher E&D to our investment in various platforms, including TikTok, or especially TikTok. We are focused on strategic pricing to drive value per unit in correct way, and we will continue to recruit for mass with very strong activities. Also commercial activities, which are focused on this, in support in the -- with the support of our retailers, which are very aligned on this front. And our high-touch services are continued to evolving, particularly online, with new technology and new activities. So the -- I also want to underline that in North America, our business of M\u00b7A\u00b7C, our business of Clinique, our business of The Ordinary, so the entry price point brands is particularly important. The scale in North America in our business is the entry price point brands, and all these brands have very exciting brand-by-brand plan. And then, the opportunity in luxury fragrances is extraordinary. And you have seen the strength of luxury fragrances around the world, and now we will further leverage also in North America as the next steps. Keep in mind that in the luxury fragrance part of our portfolio in the last 10 quarters in a row had double-digit growth or more, despite North America has not yet fully leveraged these potential engines. So this will be another big addition as of 2024.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nBryan Spillane: Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. I just have one question, and I think you've touched on it a couple of times in both the prepared remarks and the press release. It's just what's happening in Hainan with the Daigou and kind of the reseller market? So can you just -- as you're looking forward, is your expectation that it really -- that travel retail in Hainan specifically becomes really just more selling to individuals? And that the Daigou piece will be a lot smaller or maybe not even much of an element at all going forward? Just -- and if that's true, just how that changes how you're approaching operating in China now? Kind of, where do you make up those sales if you don't have the -- as big a presence with Daigou?\nTracey Travis: So I'll start in terms of that question. We don't control it, right? We sell to our travel retail operators, and so the whole mix of who is buying in Hainan is really with our retail partners. Part of the adjustment that we are seeing right now is the timing of when regular travelers return to Hainan when individual travelers, to your point, return to Hainan, and some of the changes in enforcement and regulations that have happened in China. And so there is a disconnect in timing that certainly is impacting our sales, combined with the fact that we are reducing the inventory levels that we have in Hainan. So that is all having a disproportionate effect. I think when we look at the development that has been done in Hainan, and we've talked about this for several years. Our expectation is that travelers, regular individual travelers, will return to Hainan and they will enjoy the fantastic shopping experience that has been created in Hainan, and we have no concerns whatsoever about travel retail growing with traveling consumers. It's a timing issue for us right now, and so I just wanted to really underscore that. It's a pretty -- it's having a timing issue that's having a big short-term, temporary impact for us. But we are not concerned at all about what we have shared with you in the past in terms of our strategy to continue to grow travel retail globally, and certainly in all of our markets in Asia.\nFabrizio Freda: Yes. And I just want to add that we have a clear evidence that when the -- first of all, the regulations and the retailers decide to focus on individual travelers and when individual travelers traffic becomes strongly growing, the business results are outstanding. Our business in EMEA travel retail in this moment is flying, is a plus, I believe, 36%, plus 40%, and the same in the Americas. And now, the same will start in APAC, in Japan, in Australia, et cetera. So wherever there is a post-COVID return to travel, there is a very exciting business growth. And for example, the groups were allowed so far all in Thailand. And in Thailand, this created a very interesting extra sales. So -- although to be clear, still below what was in the group since 2019, but there is a recovery trend. So the travel retail channel, in our opinion, remains very, very potential for the long term. And this business of selling to the traveling consumer during their travel is an exciting, profitable, equity-building business. What happened during the pandemic when this part of the business was closed has been a temporary distortion that will be rebalanced over time, as Tracey just explained. That is our expectation and our belief.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to talk a little bit about the Japan manufacturing facility and just, overall, Asia-based supply chain for Asia. And just to get a little bit more perspective maybe on where you stand, I guess, completion? Is it -- and I know you're not going to be able to give us something too specific, but is it by the end of the calendar year, Japan is able to fulfill all of the demand out of China? Just something to help us understand kind of the scale to get that up and running. And then the implication that has for length of supply chain and then visibility? Because if you're trying to manage in a more volatile backdrop and even offering what you have on time line for recovery in Hainan and travelers, and are they in Korea? Where are they and who are they? You need to be, I guess, more agile. And that local supply chain, I would think, would offer a lot of help on that front, but we don't really have a sense of when it becomes a local supply chain, if you will. So anything you can offer on that front would be really helpful, I think. Thanks.\nTracey Travis: Okay. Thanks, Lauren. So part of the capital that we'll be spending this year is to complete the factory. So we've done some preproduction runs in fiscal 2023. The factory will be producing a bit of the volume for the region in fiscal 2024. We have very specific plans on -- which, largely Skin Care, as we've talked in the past, some foundation products will be manufactured in the plant. Given where we're at right now, as you -- as we just spoke about in terms of Skin Care, that will be more gradual. So we have to first complete the plant. We also have opened a new, temporary distribution center in China. We'll be expanding on some of our distribution footprint in China as well. So I would say in terms of -- it will take a couple of years of ramp-up before we have the Asia supply chain fully operational and full from a capacity standpoint. That doesn't mean that as we gradually ramp up over this year and next year, we won't be creating more agility by being able to start to shift some of the production in those areas. But right now, we're working on contracting some of our production just given some of the shocks to the system. So you are absolutely right that long term, this will create agility for us. There are other things that we're doing to create agility. We've talked in the past in terms of some of the investments we've made in technology to help our -- especially in a very dynamic demand environment in order to try to forecast more accurately. I don't know that any forecasting tool would have forecasted what we experienced this past year. But certainly, as we think about all of our new innovation, all of our SKUs, new brands, et cetera, the more that we can technology enable and coordinate our inventory planning and our supply planning, the better we will have from -- experience we will have from an agility standpoint as well. So there's a tremendous amount of work that is going on to very much improve the situation going forward. Right now, we're managing just some tremendous shocks to the system that we're in the process of correcting.\nFabrizio Freda: And I would just want to add a bit more color to the concept that Tracey just underlined on the fact that despite this will take a couple of years to ramp up to get to the full leveraging, the benefits on agility will come as we go earlier. And the reason for that is that the agility is particularly needed on what we call the heroes SKUs. So the high-volume and the high-volume SKU, the one which can benefit more from speed to market, forecasting decisions which are closer to the moment where the market happens, the ability to produce depending on the trends. And so we will gradually ramp up, but we will ramp up first the SKUs and the brands that have the biggest need to create agility in Asia. And over time, then this will become our, as Tracey described, ongoing in a couple of years, we will have the full agility of the system implement.\nOperator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Fabrizio Freda",
            "content": "Thank you, Rainey, and hello to everyone. We appreciate you joining us to discuss our fiscal year 2023 results and outlook. Let me begin with the fourth quarter. We delivered an organic sales increase of 4%, achieving a return to growth for the quarter as expected. Momentum continued in the markets of EMEA and Latin America and accelerated in Asia Pacific, where organic sales growth improved from 7% in the third quarter to 36% in the fourth quarter, led by mainland China and Hong Kong SAR. Looking at the full year, while demand for our business is still strong with retail sales brought up mid-single digit globally, organic sales declined 6%. We delivered impressive double digit growth in the markets of EMEA and return to growth in Asia Pacific, while the Americas held steady. These gains across the markets of EMEA and Asia Pacific were more than offset by Asia travel retail, given the prolonged and complex recovery from the pandemic, as we have discussed in our previous earning calls. Indeed, our global travel retail business decreased 34% organically in fiscal year 2023, solely driven by Asia travel retail. Our travel retail business in EMEA and the Americas soared, and our investment in activation and in store beauty advisor drove strong performance as passenger traffic increased. The rest of our business in total rose 5% organically as growth accelerated from 10% in the third quarter to 17% in fourth quarter. The challenges in Asia travel retail disproportionately pressured skin care, which is our highest margin category. Compounding matters the leverage was pronounced as the lower level of sales consided with the elevated strategic investment in manufacturing and R&D capabilities, as well as information technology for our online business and to support our expanding supply chain globally. All told, our adjusted operating margin contracted meaningfully in fiscal year 2023 to 11.4%, modestly better than we expected in the revised outlook we offered in May. During fiscal year 2023, we continued to make progress on our sustainability goals and commitments. For our packaging goals, for instance, we had now advanced from 51% of our packaging being recyclable, refillable, reusable, recycled or recoverable in fiscal year '19 to over 70% in fiscal year 2023. As well, we are on track to maintain our status of 100% renewable electricity and Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon neutrality. We are proud to have been recognized by CDP for our continued commitment to disclose our environmental impact as reflected in our CDP climate, water and forest disclosure scores for 2022. Most notably, we achieved an A minis for our climate change disclosures, and we earned a place in the prestigious A List for water, improving our score over 2021. Looking ahead, for Asia travel retail the pressure in Hainan intensified over the course of the fourth quarter. In May and June, retail sales trends deteriorated and turned steeply negative, following the enforcement actions to control the [indiscernible] activity. The implication of these are favorable for sustainable long-term growth, but certainly create significant short-term headwinds through the transition. As we embark on fiscal year 2024, we have four strategic imperatives: drive momentum where our business is driving; reaccelerate growth in the United States; capture demand for the returning individual travel in Asia travel retail; and begin to rebuild our profitability. For fiscal year 2024, we expect to return to full year organic sales growth and margin expansion with organic sales rising 6% to 8% and adjusted operating margin improving sequentially throughout the year. Our fiscal year 2024 action plan, where we expect to again increase our investment in advertising as a percentage of sales, will also set the stage for a stronger fiscal year 2025 acceleration. One of our greatest strengths to leverage in our return to top and bottom line growth is our diverse portfolio of nearly 25 brands. Sitting at the top are our $4 billion plus brands of Clinique, Este\u0301e Lauder, La Mer and M.A.C, each a winner in its own right. M.A.C, the world's biggest prestige makeup brand, was our best-performing brand across the entire portfolio in fiscal year 2023. Its unrivaled artistry, hero products, strong earned media value ranking and breakthrough innovation of the Hyper Real franchisee in skincare drove excellent results. For fiscal year 2024, the brand is on the cusp of a big launch in makeup as M.A.C aims to extend its winning streak in innovation. Indeed, all our billion-dollar-plus brands have exciting newness ahead in both product and commercial innovation as they leverage their brand equity, scale and omnichannel beauty advisors. Clinique, the number one prestige skincare brand in the US, pioneered dermatologists develop products when it was founded in 1968. The brand is deepening its connections with dermatologists, adding powerful, instant and dermatologist-level claims, doubling down in its unique safety philosophy and activating more derm education on TikTok. And later this month, Clinique will elevate its equity in the aging with the breakthrough launch of Smart Clinical Repair Lifting Face and Neck Cream, a new dermatologist-tested formula. Este\u0301e Lauder, among the biggest prestige brands globally is extending its world-renowned Advanced Night Repair franchise with the launch of Rescue Solution for sensitive skin and the brands luxury-oriented Re-Nutriv franchise has a rich innovation program across makeup and skincare. La Mer, the global leader in luxury skincare grew double-digit in Asia Pacific in fiscal year 2023 and aims to accelerate its growth with the upcoming launch of the Lifting Firming Serum. This launch capitalizes on La Mer successfully upgraded the moisturizer soft cream as both bring advanced benefit in antiaging efficacy. Moreover, La Mer is introducing new regiments focused on the power of its iconic Miracle Broth to capitalize on the trend of night regimens. In fiscal year 2024. This esteemed tier of billion-dollar-plus brands is set to expand its brands count by 50%, as we expect Jo Malone London and TOM FORD to cross the sales threshold. These two brands have excelled over the last decade and are ideally positioned for the next decade given their positioning in the fast-growing segment of luxury and artisanal fragrance. For TOM FORD, which optimized luxury glamour, fiscal year 2023 was monumental. We are thrilled to have acquired the brand after having collaborated to create TOM FORD for over 15 years. This acquisition is a central building block to realize our aspirations in high-growth luxury ecotour beauty. Moreover, the brand sales rose strong double-digits organically in fragrance for the fiscal year. The breadth of this performance was stunning as over 30 markets grew double digits. The strengths of its hero products and innovation proven a powerful combination with new and excite -- and existing consumers. And TOM FORD Enticing Cafe Rose launch to begin fiscal year 2024. In makeup, TOM FORD delivered double-digit organic sales growth in Asia Pacific and the markets in EMEA, driven by excellent performance in lips. Among our other scaling brands or those with sales between $500 million and $1 billion, we are encouraged by their progress in fiscal year 2023. For Bobbi Brown Cosmetics, the brand continued to complement its expanding makeup business with strong growth in skincare, while Aveda executed on its global ambition with a successful launch in mainland China. The Ordinary graduated into our tier of scale brands as double-digit sales growth propelled it well above $500 million. The brand's list of achievements for the year is long, indeed from success in its hero product to a step change in the contribution, to sales from innovation to doubling its TikTok followers, to strong share gains in prestige skincare in the U.S. and Western Europe, The Ordinary proved its high-performance ingredient led products are well loved. And we believe it is just getting started in realizing its global potential. Looking across our developing brands in which we strategically invest to realize the scaly brands of the future. Le Labo, KILIAN PARIS and Editions de Parfums, Frederic Malle each achieved the double-digit organic sales growth in fiscal year 2023 to continue their winning streaks. Impressively, over the last five years, these three brands have delivered over 30% compound annual growth, demonstrating brand-building acumen. At this time next year, we will be on the verge of launching Balmain Beauty with the namesake luxury fashion house. Our collaboration with Balmain has been exceptional and we cannot wait to introduce this new luxury beauty brand to the world. For our brand portfolio, we have positioned ourselves to take advantage of the efficiency, the effectiveness that will be enabled by generative AI. Furthermore, creating high-quality, high-performing products is in our DNA. Innovation has long served as a catalyst for growth, once again represented over 25% of our sales in fiscal year 2023. We have a rich pipeline on newness slated for fiscal year 2024 and it gets even bigger and stronger in fiscal year 2025 with more breakthrough innovation and expansion into widespread opportunities. Over the last few years, aligned with our innovation strategy, we have significantly increased the breadth, depth and diversity of our clinical studies for new and legacy products across categories to deliver impactful claims. This work, combined with our newly opened China Innovation Labs in Shanghai equips us with even greater capabilities to drive growth with consumers locally and around the world. For skincare, we have also significantly increased our scientific credentialing, demonstrated by an 85% increase in scientific advisory board members and third-party dermatologists and academic partners in the last two years. Last month at the World Congress of Dermatology in Singapore, we presented several studies for Clinique, Este\u0301e Lauder and La Mer. This was a milestone moment for Este\u0301e Lauder's Re-Nutriv franchise as our scientists unveiled our newness Breath Rule Longevity Age Reversal research on a global stage. Re-Nutriv has been continued to be a pioneer in this frontier of skin biology and will extend upon the recent success of Ultimate Diamond Transformative Brilliance Serum with compelling innovation this fiscal year. As we rebuild from the challenges of fiscal year 2023, we expect to leverage and stand upon these trends as we drive resilient growth. The opportunities ahead of us are significant as over 900 million people are expected to enter the middle class through 2030 and drive consumption as they seek the high-quality, strong efficacy and joy the prestige beauty affords. Our company has great confidence in the long-term development of China and we are proud of the very strong business we have built, led by our exceptional local team. The Chinese consumers continue to be the unrivaled number one growth drivers of our industry throughout the decade. We are pleased to have returned to organic sales growth in mainland China this fiscal year 2023, and to have expanded our prestige beauty share as the market gradually evolves in its recovery from the pandemic. Impressively, mainland China's fourth quarter organic sales were up double digit compared to both one and two years ago and we further expanded our prestige beauty share in the quarter. We made significant long-term investment in the market across fiscal year 2023. Beyond the opening of the China innovation lab in Shanghai and a new distribution center in Guangzhou, we launched Aveda to start the year and Le Labo to end the year. Aveda quickly captured up the ranks of prestige hair care, driven in part by its focus on the skinification of hair and high-performance product for scalp care. Le Labo initial freestanding store in Shanghai redefines experiential shopping, which makes it no surprise that it was the brand's top-performing store in the world in the month of June. We also invested in the vibrant opportunity in both brick-and-mortar and online, opening in seven new cities, expanding our online reach with Douyin and creating exceptional live streaming content which, as you know, is a game changer to excel in the market. Our online ecosystem continues to move from strength to strength across social and commerce, encompassing Timo, JD, WeChat, Red and Douyin, among others, driving our share gains for the fiscal quarter and year. Online in Mainland China performed exceptionally well every month in the fourth quarter to realize over 60% organic sales growth and expand online prestige beauty share by 2 points, owning to innovation, gifting campaigns and excellent execution. We capped the quarter success on 6/18, where our brand strength was broad-based. Este\u0301e Lauder ranked number one in store live streaming prestige beauty on both Timo and Douyin, La Mer ranked the number one in luxe beauty on Timo for the third consecutive year, and Jo Malone London took the top spot on Timo and JD for luxe fragrances. From an organizational standpoint, mainland China and China travel retail have enhanced their capabilities for local coordination of go-to-market strategies and plans to maximize long-term value and support brand equity. The expected growth of the middle class around the world is exciting implication of our business, given also our vibrant emerging market portfolio. Indeed, in fiscal year 2023, our emerging markets delivered organic sales growth of 20% led by India, Brazil, Turkey and Thailand. India grew nearly 50% for the year, driven by excellent performance by our long-standing brands in the market and the very successful launch of The Ordinary. In North America, we are focused on reaccelerating growth to better capture prestige beauty opportunities in the region. Our multi-facet strategy plan includes launching a robust innovation pipeline, increasing engagement by brands on TikTok, accentuating our strength in luxury and artisanal fragrance and high-performance, ingredient-led skin care, and expand the brand reach in specialty multi, among other initiatives. And we are excited to extend our reach online as The Ordinary and Estee Lauder are soon to launch on TikTok Shop. Let me now turn to our profitability. We have identified four building blocks to progressively expand adjusted operating margin over the next few years. First, we are focused on optimizing mix by elevating luxury across brands, driven by consumer preferences, by expanding our direct-to-consumer ecosystem across brick-and-mortar and online. Second, we see many opportunities to maximize value through better price realization and accretive innovation. Third, we intend to increasingly leverage the strategic investment we have made over the last few years, most notably our new manufacturing facility in Japan and expanded online capabilities. Last, we believe we can unlock meaningful cost efficiencies in our value chain as we complete the rollout and adoption of our new integrated business planning process across the global operation and use generative AI to drive efficiencies. In closing, while we had a challenging year, we remain confident in our long-term strategy to realize the promising growth opportunity in global prestige beauty with our diversified portfolio brands, robust research and development capability and global reach. We are encouraged by the fundamental strength of our business in the markets of EMEA, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and are focused on our plans to recover growth in Asia travel retail and North America. For fiscal year 2024, we believe we are well positioned to return to organic sales growth and improve profitability. To our employees, you are the heart and the soul of our beautiful company, and I extend my deepest gratitude to your exceptional contribution and dedication. And now, I will turn the call over to Tracey. Yes, on our leadership [Technical Difficulty] In June, we look at the strategy and the strategy of the future. And so what Tracey and I have presented in our prepared remarks are the results of also this work of reconfirming the strategy for 2024 for the next three years. And so, what are the key takeaways was your question. It's that, first of all, the market of global prestige beauty continue to be very attractive and will continue to be more and more attractive in the future. And our strategy is, as I explained in the prepared remarks, is now focused on continue building on our strengths and continue building the areas where we are really delivering great results and supporting this growth. At the same time, continue reinforcing the health of our brands and the innovation of our brands and refocusing resources and activities in all these areas. And then fix the TR issue, including a much better coordination between TR organization in China and China region organization in mainland, and the plans for the North America acceleration and to continue winning emerging markets. By the way, in the last quarter we're astonishing with a 38% growth. And so, deploying the resources, the capabilities, the skills to continue doing this in the key emerging markets, I have to say, the excitement in India is particularly high. And so, in summary, the leadership of the company has agreed and allocated resources and skills on the key components of the strategy for the next three years, which is, leverage the growth of the market and obviously, continue to build our strengths, fix our issues, and most importantly, support the profit recovery plan that again, we explained in the prepared remarks, in every single aspect at the accelerated pace of profit recovery, as Tracey just explained. Yes. In terms of the visibility to the guidance, obviously, Tracey and I have given you this guidance, we believe that that's the -- in this moment, is the project of the business. So we have visibility and clarity in terms of our plans. I want, however, to underline that the volatility externally remain very, very high, particularly the volatility in the Chinese market, the volatility in the transition in the TR market from the Daigou to the regular travelers, the transition to the groups traveling. They've just been announced in turn are low. The transition, obviously, on the judgment of what the economy recovery will be globally, particularly in the post-pandemic environment, particularly how the economy in China will evolve. So all these external elements are part, obviously our assumptions of these external elements are part of our guidance. And in the press release, we made an effort to explain all our assumptions in the guidance. And then in terms of our internal plans and in term of the continued leveraging our current trends on the things which are working, we are pretty confident. The real question is, how fast we will be fixing the issues? But the strengths of the current trends of what is working are frankly more easy to predict and to forecast. So net, we believe in our guidance, but will be obviously volatility to be managed in the context of the future, and you will see as much as we will see the evolution in these areas. And then Tracey? Good morning. Yes. So I mean the -- in terms of the travel retail issue, you described it well. So we have increased the collaboration between the local team and the TR team just to have not only a better common decision-making on the key prioritization on the balancing act in order to create value and in order to continue to develop brand equities in a more coordinated way, but we also have more analytics to understand the channel dynamics, the pricing differentials and all the things. So we have created the base of much more information and timely information to take the right decisions in coordination. So this is a big improvement that should reduce the risk of non-coordinated actions in the future. Then the brand health that you also mentioned, I want to underline, the brand health is evident from the results in China. The brand health in -- with the Chinese consumers is really strong. And we have good market share results, which we already mentioned. The business has been growing 36% in the April, June quarter. The online market share has been extremely strong, 2 points extra of online market share. Our activation and consumer passion for our brands has been further confirmed by external research that our brands are at the top of the ranking of desirable brands in the market. So the brand equity, the brand health, also thanks the extraordinary work of our Mainland region, China Mainland region team is in good shape. And then you said correctly that we are very focused on the sell-through of the stocks, just to [indiscernible] the stocks. Obviously, as Tracey has explained, in May, June, Hainan was relatively weak, and that's why there is an impact also on the first quarter trend. But is -- but we are very focused on creating the retail activities that will facilitate the sell-through, and that's the key focus of the team. So in that area, we are very aligned, we have the organization resources squared, and we are focused on all these issues very squarely. On the second part of your question is, if I can give you light on the other markets. I mean the -- I hope that the report is very clear. The rest of our business, ex the TR Asia, has been growing in the last quarter, 17%. This is one of our fastest growth rate ever despite North America flat. And so we have really undergone strengths in all the rest of our business, which is the result of all the brand strengths which I explained in the prepared remarks. So we have four very big brands, well above $1 billion brands, and we will have two more. So to be clear, we will be a company by the end of 2024 with $6 billion brands, extraordinary scale in the global system and global reach. So this is behind our strengths. Then I wanted to underline the strengths of our innovation. Our innovation is strong. It's also in tough challenging year like 2023, remains at 25%. And the innovation pipeline for 2024, 2025 is very, very strong. Particularly in 2025, we have some extra wide spaces innovation, which are very promising. So this also will support the continuous strength of these other parts of the business -- other regions, as you mentioned. And then finally, the execution in this region has been stepping up because we explained that as the recovery from the pandemic progress, our ability to execute in the post-pandemic world has been developed and is getting better and better month after month. So in the regions which have been faster in the post-pandemic development, we have been faster in recovering great execution and great results, so this will continue to progress in 2024. So we have good confidence on that. On the U.S. where, on the contrary, we said there is work to be done, the team is very focused on doing this work. We have a very clear plan. Again, I summarized them in the prepared remarks, but to go back to them, our strategy in rebuilding the North America growth is really various [indiscernible] four big building blocks. The first one is a very rich pipeline of newness, which is later in 2024 and further reinforced in 2025, focus on breakthrough innovation on new claims that will help also unlocking the consumers in online, and especially multi more aggressively. We are driving higher E&D to our investment in various platforms, including TikTok, or especially TikTok. We are focused on strategic pricing to drive value per unit in correct way, and we will continue to recruit for mass with very strong activities. Also commercial activities, which are focused on this, in support in the -- with the support of our retailers, which are very aligned on this front. And our high-touch services are continued to evolving, particularly online, with new technology and new activities. So the -- I also want to underline that in North America, our business of M\u00b7A\u00b7C, our business of Clinique, our business of The Ordinary, so the entry price point brands is particularly important. The scale in North America in our business is the entry price point brands, and all these brands have very exciting brand-by-brand plan. And then, the opportunity in luxury fragrances is extraordinary. And you have seen the strength of luxury fragrances around the world, and now we will further leverage also in North America as the next steps. Keep in mind that in the luxury fragrance part of our portfolio in the last 10 quarters in a row had double-digit growth or more, despite North America has not yet fully leveraged these potential engines. So this will be another big addition as of 2024. Yes. And I just want to add that we have a clear evidence that when the -- first of all, the regulations and the retailers decide to focus on individual travelers and when individual travelers traffic becomes strongly growing, the business results are outstanding. Our business in EMEA travel retail in this moment is flying, is a plus, I believe, 36%, plus 40%, and the same in the Americas. And now, the same will start in APAC, in Japan, in Australia, et cetera. So wherever there is a post-COVID return to travel, there is a very exciting business growth. And for example, the groups were allowed so far all in Thailand. And in Thailand, this created a very interesting extra sales. So -- although to be clear, still below what was in the group since 2019, but there is a recovery trend. So the travel retail channel, in our opinion, remains very, very potential for the long term. And this business of selling to the traveling consumer during their travel is an exciting, profitable, equity-building business. What happened during the pandemic when this part of the business was closed has been a temporary distortion that will be rebalanced over time, as Tracey just explained. That is our expectation and our belief. And I would just want to add a bit more color to the concept that Tracey just underlined on the fact that despite this will take a couple of years to ramp up to get to the full leveraging, the benefits on agility will come as we go earlier. And the reason for that is that the agility is particularly needed on what we call the heroes SKUs. So the high-volume and the high-volume SKU, the one which can benefit more from speed to market, forecasting decisions which are closer to the moment where the market happens, the ability to produce depending on the trends. And so we will gradually ramp up, but we will ramp up first the SKUs and the brands that have the biggest need to create agility in Asia. And over time, then this will become our, as Tracey described, ongoing in a couple of years, we will have the full agility of the system implement."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Tracey Travis",
            "content": "Thank you, Fabrizio, and hello, everyone. While we certainly had many successes this past fiscal year, as you just heard, we are not satisfied with our fiscal 2023 financial results and are executing on our strategy to progressively rebuild the margin accretive areas of our business over the next few years, and leverage the investments we have made in manufacturing, distribution and technology capabilities. I will further address our plans when I discuss our fiscal 2024 outlook, but first, I will cover the fiscal 2023 fourth quarter and full year results. Our fourth quarter organic net sales increased 4% and earnings per share was $0.07. From a geographic standpoint, organic net sales grew in nearly all markets in both Asia Pacific and EMEA. This strong performance was partially offset by the ongoing challenges in our Asia travel retail business as we expected. Organic net sales in Asia Pacific rose 36%, reflecting double-digit growth in most markets, led by Mainland China and Hong Kong SAR, as they continue to progress in recovery with fewer COVID-related restrictions compared to the prior year. They also benefited from our successful brand innovations, new product launches, activation consumer -- of consumers and targeted consumer reach. In Mainland China, online realized over 30% organic growth and achieved approximately 60% penetration of sales in the quarter. In EMEA, organic net sales decreased 15%. The growth in nearly all markets and channels of distribution was more than offset by the performance of our Asia travel retail business. In Hainan, retail sales declined more than we expected in the quarter for the reasons Fabrizio mentioned. Excluding our travel retail business, net sales in both Makeup and Fragrance rose double digits in the region, benefiting from our strategic investments in advertising and promotional activities and the reestablishment of services in our stores. Organic net sales in the Americas were flat compared to last year. The strong double-digit increase in Latin America driven by the re-acceleration of Makeup growth in Brazil and Mexico, was offset by the decline in the United States due to the slower-than-expected pace of improvement in retail sales of several of our brands. Standout performance from The Ordinary continues to be a bright spot in the region for the many reasons that Fabrizio mentioned earlier. From a product category perspective, Makeup organic net sales increased 13%, reflecting growth in each region led by Asia Pacific as recovery continued and usage occasions increased. M.A.C, Este\u0301e Lauder and TOM FORD drove growth, benefiting from investments in brand activations and increases in in-store staffing, the continued success of hero products, as well as new product launches. Fragrance organic net sales rose 12%, led by Le Labo and TOM FORD. Strong double-digit growth from Le Labo reflected increases in every region, momentum from our city exclusive special collection as well as growth from both existing and new points of distribution, including its expansion into mainland China. The increase from TOM FORD was fueled by strategic investments in advertising and promotional activities to support key shopping moments and brand activations. Organic net sales increased 6% in Hair Care and declined 3% in Skin Care. The pressures in our Asia travel retail business drove the Skin Care decline and were largely offset by the exceptional growth in the Asia/Pacific region. La Mer and Este\u0301e Lauder declined, while The Ordinary, Bobbi Brown and M.A.C grew. M.A.C's growth was driven by the launch of the Hyper Real line of skin care products. Our gross margin declined 330 basis points compared to last year. This decline primarily reflects the under absorption of overhead in our plants due to the pull down of production throughout the year given our elevated inventory levels, as well as increased obsolescence charges. Operating expenses increased 70 basis points as a percent of sales, driven largely by the increase in advertising and promotional activities to support commercial activations in the quarter. Operating income declined 66% to $71 million, and our operating margin contracted 380 basis points to 2% in the quarter. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was a negative 17.9% compared to 14.2% last year due to a true-up in the quarter to reflect the final effective tax rate for the fiscal 2023 full year. Diluted EPS of $0.07 decreased 82% compared to last year. The impact from foreign currency translation and foreign currency transactions in key travel retail locations negatively impacted EPS by 7% and 9%, respectively. As we discussed in May, we completed the acquisition of the TOM FORD brand and the related intellectual property on April 28, paying approximately $2.3 billion. As a result of this acquisition, we entered into arrangements to license the TOM FORD trademark for eyewear to Marcolin and fashion to Zegna, which were the brand's prior licensees, creating a new revenue stream for the company. This acquisition had a dilutive impact to EPS of $0.01 including interest expense on our debt financing and reflecting savings from royalties we no longer have to pay. Shifting now to our full year results. This has certainly been a more volatile year than we anticipated. The challenges to our business in Asia travel retail and the United States as well as in the first half in Mainland China were partially offset by the progression of recovery everywhere else. In Mainland China, we continue to gain share in all major product categories, demonstrating the strong demand for our products, although we remain conscious of the evolving economic conditions. And overall, our investments in brand activations, increased in-store staffing, distribution expansion and online capabilities aided in the acceleration of recovery of sales which largely occurred in brick-and-mortar channels, excluding travel retail. Net sales growth was strong in brick-and-mortar, particularly in our freestanding stores and with our specialty multi-retailers. Global travel retail represented 20% of our reported sales in fiscal 2023. And online net sales, which were flat, represented 29% of our reported sales. Organic net sales fell 6%, primarily reflecting the challenges in our Asia travel retail business, which drove the declines in our EMEA region of 16% and in Skin Care of 14%. Nearly all other domestic markets in EMEA grew double digits. In Asia Pacific, net sales rose 4% as markets continue to progress in recovery throughout the year and benefited from investments in advertising and promotional activities, innovation and distribution expansion. Net sales in the Americas was flat compared to last year. Regarding categories, Fragrance net sales increased 14%, rising double digits in every geographic region and benefiting from the continued strength of hero products, successful innovation and distribution expansion, while Skin Care was more challenged in Asia travel retail and North America. Net sales grew 6% in Hair Care and was flat in Makeup. Our gross margin declined 440 basis points compared to last year, largely due to the slower-than-expected recovery in Asia travel retail. This includes higher obsolescence charges under absorption of overhead in our plants due to the pull-down of production throughout the year, given our higher inventory levels and less favorable category mix from our Skin Care mix. Operating expenses increased 390 basis points to 59.9% of sales, driven primarily by the decline in sales. Despite the pressures to sales, we sustained our investments to support markets where recovery was evident, including in areas such as advertising, promotion, innovation and selling, which collectively increased by 280 basis points as a percent of sales. Operating income declined 48% to $1.8 billion from $3.5 billion last year, and our operating margin contracted 830 basis points to 11.4% for the full year. In spite of the challenges that materially impacted our top line growth, we continued certain of our strategic investments important to support recovery and drive long-term sales growth and profitability. Our effective tax rate for the year was 26.5% compared to 21.3% last year, primarily reflecting the change in our geographical mix of earnings. Net sales declined 53% to $1.2 billion, and diluted EPS of $3.46 decreased 52% compared to last year, including the dilutive impacts from foreign currency translation and foreign currency transactions in key retail -- travel retail locations of 4% each. The acquisition of the TOM FORD brand was dilutive to EPS by $0.01. Now turning to our cash flows for the fiscal year. We generated $1.7 billion in net cash flows from operating activities compared to $3 billion last year. The decrease reflects lower net income, partially offset by lower working capital. We invested $1 billion in capital expenditures for supply chain enhancements, including our new manufacturing facility in Japan, consumer-facing capital, such as distribution expansion, investments in existing counters and online capabilities. We returned $1.2 billion in cash to stockholders through both dividends and share repurchases. Beginning in December of 2022, we suspended the repurchase of shares given the increase in debt due to the TOM FORD acquisition. Before I turn to our outlook for the full year, I want to take a moment to first address the recent cybersecurity incident we disclosed in July, involving an unauthorized third-party that gained access to some of our systems. After becoming aware of the incident, we proactively took down some of our systems. We began bringing our systems back online within days, which limited the incidents impact on the company's operations. Based on the information available to date, we believe the incident is contained. So now, let's turn to our outlook. This past year has undoubtedly been difficult, largely given the challenges we faced from increased market volatility in certain markets and the corresponding impact on our business. As we work to return to net sales growth in fiscal 2024, and over the next few years, progressively rebuild our operating margin, we remain focused on the transition of key areas of our business that have been disproportionately impacted by a slower pace of recovery, while also continuing to support growth in those areas where the recovery is more advanced. Over the next few years, mainland China and our travel retail business are expected to remain key drivers of our long-term profitable growth, and we anticipate continued growth with other areas of our business, including emerging markets globally, our more mature markets in the West and our direct-to-consumer channels globally. Assuming an eventual return to global prestige growth of 4% to 5%, we expect to return to more consistent compounded annual sales growth within our 6% to 8% long-term growth algorithm. Restoration of our operating margin is a top priority, though margin recovery will not happen in one year. We do, however, expect to progressively drive margin expansion as we return to profitable growth in Skin Care, improved Makeup margins and continue to drive our momentum in Fragrance, particularly our high-end artisanal fragrance brands. In addition, we plan to expand our gross margins through continuing to leverage our prestige pricing power, inclusive of driving additional accretive and compelling innovation, and improvements in operational efficiencies including enhanced supply demand planning and inventory optimization to reduce excess inventory and discount. We will begin to leverage the further regionalization of our manufacturing and distribution network in Asia to create greater inventory agility as demand fluctuates. Overall, beginning in fiscal 2024, we expect to recapture lost operating margin -- overall -- I'm sorry, beyond fiscal 2024, we expect to recapture lost operating margin at an accelerated pace by delivering annual margin expansion that is faster than our pre-pandemic historical average. This acceleration is expected to become more evident after the first quarter of fiscal 2024. So turning to fiscal 2024. We expect to continue to deliver net sales gains in the areas that performed well in 2023, including Asia Pacific, our Western and emerging European markets and Latin America, as they continue to progress in recovery from the pandemic, and benefit from the strategic actions we are taking to accelerate growth, including targeted consumer activation, compelling innovation and distribution enhancements that we drove throughout the pandemic period. We are, however, mindful of the macroeconomic headwinds that have emerged in Chinese economy. This has also resulted in our Asia travel retail business taking a bit longer than we originally anticipated to return to growth as travel and conversion remain pressured, which has been exacerbated by the sudden reduction of sales to non-travelers relative to the return of individual travelers in Korea and in Hainan. Correspondingly, inventory levels in the trade in Asia travel retail have improved at a slower pace. This will create greater pressure on our first half as we expect to continue to both adjust our shipments and increase our retail activation but also should yield sequential quarterly improvements throughout the year in both sales and margin. With that backdrop in mind, and using June 30 spot rates of $1.087 for the euro, $1.261 for the pound, $7.253 for the Chinese yuan and $13.21 for the Korean won, the full fiscal year organic net sales are forecasted to grow 6% to 8%. Royalty revenue from the acquisition of the TOM FORD brand is not expected to be material to net sales growth and will be excluded from organic net sales until the fourth quarter. The cybersecurity incident is also not expected to have a material impact to net sales. Currency translation is expected to dilute reported sales growth for the full fiscal year by 1 percentage point. We take the majority of our pricing actions at the beginning of our fiscal year. Our strategic price increases, including new products are expected to add approximately 5 points of growth. We expect the net benefits from strategic pricing, discount reductions and lower obsolescence to drive gross margin expansion for the full year, partially offset by manufacturing under absorption. We are aligning our production volumes to address a more variable demand environment with the intent to carry less inventory in our system and in the trade, while we continue to regionalize our supply base in Asia. However, we expect the lower mix of net sales from the highly margin-accretive areas of our business, including Asia travel retail and Skin Care, and the under-absorption of overhead to result in margin contraction in the first half of the year. This is expected to be more than offset by gross margin expansion in the second half of the year, given the greater mix of our travel retail business and Skin Care and less obsolescence charges compared to last year. Our full year operating margin is forecasted to be approximately 12% to 12.5%, a 60 to 110 basis point expansion from fiscal 2023. In fiscal 2024, we anticipate sequential margin expansion throughout the year driven by improvements in gross margin, while also maintaining go-to-market initiatives where appropriate. We expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 27%. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $3.50 and $3.75 before restructuring and other charges. The cybersecurity incident is expected to be approximately $0.07 dilutive to EPS. Our EPS range also includes approximately $0.11 of dilution from currency translation. In constant currency, we expect EPS to grow by approximately 4% to 12%. Net cash flows from operating activities are forecasted between $1.7 billion and $1.8 billion. Capital expenditures are planned at approximately 6% of forecasted net sales as we expect to fund new distribution and online capabilities, further enhance our manufacturing and distribution network, including the completion of our first manufacturing facility in Asia located in Japan to support the development of our Asia Pacific region. We also plan to continue investing in information technology to support our business. Our fiscal 2024 outlook also assumes flat quarterly dividend and the continued suspension of our share repurchases as we focus on deleveraging after the TOM FORD acquisition and prepare for the payment to purchase the remaining outstanding equity interest in DECIEM anticipated in May of 2024. For our first quarter, we currently expect organic net sales to fall 12% to 10%. The cybersecurity incident is not expected to have a material impact to net sales. At this time, we expect first quarter diluted EPS of negative $0.31 to negative $0.21 before restructuring and other charges. The cybersecurity incident is expected to be approximately $0.07 dilutive to EPS. This also includes approximately $0.02 of dilution from currency translation. In constant currency, we expect EPS of negative $0.29 to negative $0.19. I would like to close by thanking our employees for their dedication and focus during what turned out to be a challenging year. While we are not satisfied with our performance overall, we are certainly pleased by the results we were able to deliver in many recovering markets and brands. For fiscal 2024, we believe we have the right plans to navigate the environment as we gradually return to our historical cadence of long-term progressive and sustainable sales and profit growth, fueled by our highly desirable brand portfolio and our incredibly talented employees. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time. Hi, Steve. So I'll start with your question regarding the cadence of the year. And you're right, there is a lot of variability. If I would take you back to the first and second quarter of last year, you'll recall that while we had some disruption in Hainan, we did have -- we still had some business in Hainan. We also had business in Korea. So our travel retail percent of mix was higher in the first half of last year in addition to, obviously, the recovery that we were seeing in the EMEA and Americas regions in terms of the airports in those regions. In the second half of the year, then obviously, we saw the challenges that we've called out certainly in the last call as it relates to both Korea, and obviously what Fabrizio talked about in the fourth quarter as it relates to Hainan. We have a bit of a reverse situation as we're anniversarying those impacts this year. So with what happened in the May, June time frame in Hainan, we are seeing traffic and less conversion in Hainan than we saw previously. That is impacting our Q1 certainly compared to last year when we saw more traffic and more conversion in Hainan and in Korea. That gets a bit better in Q2, as we anniversary some of the softness that began to materialize in Q2 last year in those two areas. And then we're anniversarying, obviously, the softness that we experienced in the second half of our fiscal 2023 in fiscal 2024. So we are expecting that travel retail will get progressively better in the third and fourth quarter, certainly compared to the third and fourth quarter we had this year. Part of that, Steve, is obviously the destocking that we are doing. So in Hainan, obviously, with the sudden change in Daigou, that is making the retail traffic slower than what we had anticipated. And as a result of that, it's changing our view on the shipments that we will need for Hainan in the first quarter and certainly a bit into the second quarter. So I hope that helps in terms of some of the cadence of what we're experiencing and why the margin differential is so great. As you know, Travel Retail certainly benefits from a lot of the investment that we make in our markets like China and Korea and Japan, and all of the other markets not only in Asia, but in EMEA as well. And so it is a high margin -- higher margin channel for us for some of those reasons. Fabrizio? Yes, Dara. So I mean, certainly, we are encouraged by some of the signs we see -- recent signs that we see in terms of recovery. The return of travelers. We are, as Fabrizio mentioned, in terms of our fiscal 2024, taking actions to pretty dramatically pull back on some of our production so that we can get our inventory levels in line. And that will improve our margin. And I talked about in my prepared remarks that we're expecting gross margin recovery from some of those actions. As the situation normalizes and more travelers come back to travel retail, we are very confident in the strategy that we've had previously. Pre-pandemic, we were well on our way to those 20% operating margins. We don't see any reason why, once things normalize, that we can't get back to those 20% margins. Timing, I can't give you. I have said in our prepared remarks that we certainly, over the next few years, have plans to accelerate the margin progression well above our historical guidance of 50 basis points of margin improvement, and that does recommend -- that does represent a catch-up in margin progression and again, the strategies that we have to do that. But we are incredibly focused as an organization on returning to the margins that are more representative of our growth and our growth potential. I will also underscore the fact that we will not do that at the expense -- at the short-term expense of hurting our brands or hurting our markets that are in recovery, so it is a balancing act for us in terms of making sure we're making the right surgical investments that support not only the recovery and the markets that are further along in recovery, and as well as the long-term investments that we need to continue our growth algorithm of 6% to 8% top line growth and margin expansion. So again, I can't -- I know that's not the answer you're looking for in terms of you want a specific year and a specific number. And hopefully, we will be able to give that to you when we get a bit more clarity on more stabilization in the environment. But right now, you have the commitment of our entire organization that we recognize and have plans to accelerate our margin progression well beyond our historical levels in order to try to catch up. So I'll start in terms of that question. We don't control it, right? We sell to our travel retail operators, and so the whole mix of who is buying in Hainan is really with our retail partners. Part of the adjustment that we are seeing right now is the timing of when regular travelers return to Hainan when individual travelers, to your point, return to Hainan, and some of the changes in enforcement and regulations that have happened in China. And so there is a disconnect in timing that certainly is impacting our sales, combined with the fact that we are reducing the inventory levels that we have in Hainan. So that is all having a disproportionate effect. I think when we look at the development that has been done in Hainan, and we've talked about this for several years. Our expectation is that travelers, regular individual travelers, will return to Hainan and they will enjoy the fantastic shopping experience that has been created in Hainan, and we have no concerns whatsoever about travel retail growing with traveling consumers. It's a timing issue for us right now, and so I just wanted to really underscore that. It's a pretty -- it's having a timing issue that's having a big short-term, temporary impact for us. But we are not concerned at all about what we have shared with you in the past in terms of our strategy to continue to grow travel retail globally, and certainly in all of our markets in Asia. Okay. Thanks, Lauren. So part of the capital that we'll be spending this year is to complete the factory. So we've done some preproduction runs in fiscal 2023. The factory will be producing a bit of the volume for the region in fiscal 2024. We have very specific plans on -- which, largely Skin Care, as we've talked in the past, some foundation products will be manufactured in the plant. Given where we're at right now, as you -- as we just spoke about in terms of Skin Care, that will be more gradual. So we have to first complete the plant. We also have opened a new, temporary distribution center in China. We'll be expanding on some of our distribution footprint in China as well. So I would say in terms of -- it will take a couple of years of ramp-up before we have the Asia supply chain fully operational and full from a capacity standpoint. That doesn't mean that as we gradually ramp up over this year and next year, we won't be creating more agility by being able to start to shift some of the production in those areas. But right now, we're working on contracting some of our production just given some of the shocks to the system. So you are absolutely right that long term, this will create agility for us. There are other things that we're doing to create agility. We've talked in the past in terms of some of the investments we've made in technology to help our -- especially in a very dynamic demand environment in order to try to forecast more accurately. I don't know that any forecasting tool would have forecasted what we experienced this past year. But certainly, as we think about all of our new innovation, all of our SKUs, new brands, et cetera, the more that we can technology enable and coordinate our inventory planning and our supply planning, the better we will have from -- experience we will have from an agility standpoint as well. So there's a tremendous amount of work that is going on to very much improve the situation going forward. Right now, we're managing just some tremendous shocks to the system that we're in the process of correcting."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies' Fiscal 2023 Third Quarter Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded and webcast. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Rainey Mancini. Ma'am, you may begin.\nRainey Mancini: Hello. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges and adjustments disclosed in our press release. Unless otherwise stated, all organic net sales growth also excludes the non-comparable impacts of acquisitions, divestitures, brand closures, and the impact of foreign currency translation. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our press release and on the Investors section of our Web site. As a reminder, references to online sales include sales we make directly to our consumers through our brand.com sites and through third-party platforms. It also includes estimated sales of our products through our retailers' Web sites. During the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourselves to one question, so we can respond to all of you within the time scheduled for this call. And now I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio.\nFabrizio Freda: Thank you, Rainey, and hello to everyone. We appreciate you being with us today to discuss our third quarter results, and revised outlook for fiscal year 2023. In the third quarter, organic sales fell 8% at the high-end of our outlook range, and the sequential improvements from the decline of 11% in the second quarter. Nearly all developed and emerging markets grew organically, and outperformed our expectations to offset an even lower-than-expected recovery in our Asia travel retail business. As we discussed in February, Asia travel retail faced two headwinds in the third quarter. The first, elevated inventory in Hainan, given retailers 'expectation for a more accelerated recovery proved very challenging, as conversion of travelers to consumers in prestige beauty lagged historical trends, as travels initially gravitated through other categories. This led to even lower replenishment orders than we anticipated. The second headwinds, the transition in Korea to post-pandemic regulations as traveling consumers gradually returned pressured sales meaningfully. In China and Korea, the resumption of international flight was subdued. Limited visas were granted, and group tours were slow to restart. These factors resulted in lower-than-expected traffic in airports throughout the region, which combined with a lower-than-expected conversion further moderated replenishment orders. With this said, there were bright spots for travel retail in Hong Kong, Macau, Europe, and the Americas. All told, global travel retail organic sales declined 45%. This was partially offset by excellent organic sales growth of 10% in the rest of our global business. Our retail sales growth was even stronger than organic sales growth in many markets around the world, including China and the U.S. Encouragingly, retail sales performance is significantly ahead of organic sales result in global travel retail, which gives us confidence that the challenges in travel retail are abating with time. Furthermore, this strength at retail, including prestige beauty share gains in many markets demonstrated a benefit of our continuing investment in innovation and building the desirability of our brand around the world. This positive retail trends are expected to continue in the fourth quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS in the fiscal third quarter fell 75%, which was also at the high-end of our outlook. We invested to fuel market in various stages of post pandemic recovery, launching sought after innovation, expanding brand into markets, and increasing advertising as percentage of sales. As the shape recovery for Asia travel retail comes into better focus, it is proving to be both far more volatile than we expected, and more gradual relative to what we experienced in other markets. We are therefore lowering our organic sales and EPS outlook for fiscal year 2023, as we reduced our implied fourth quarter outlook, primarily for Asia travel retail. For Asia travel retail, there are two factors driving our revised outlook. In Hainan, the pressure from elevated inventory in the trade is proving to be deeper and longer-lasting, driven by this lower-than-expected consumption trend I discussed compounded by the retailer inventory tightening. Second, the resumption of international travel by Chinese consumer is evolving more slowly than we anticipated. Having visited Shanghai and Hainan in March, and witnessed firsthand the optimism of consumers, retailers, [fashionists] (ph), and our local teams, I am very encouraged for the future of our business with the Chinese consumers. I also had the good fortune to officially open our new China Innovation Lab, and met with the amazing scientist and product development specialist in the state-of-art R&D facility which further bolstered my confidence in the business fundamentals. Indeed, the opportunity for prestige beauty and our brands with the Chinese consumer in the mid- to-long term remains vibrant in the domestic market, in Hainan and internationally, which remains our focus through this complex phase of recovery from the pandemic. For our fourth quarter outlook, the far slower organic sales growth that we anticipated in February is impacting profitability significantly. There are two factors at play be under pressure to a bigger margin accretive area of our business. First, with the rest of the business growing strongly, we will continue to invest to drive the momentum in those areas. Second, strategic and necessary long-term investments in manufacturing, R&D, and information technology capabilities are pressuring margin with the slow recovery of sales. With this said, we are obviously not satisfied by the profitability in our revised outlook for fiscal year 2023. For the future, we are focused on a plan to further accelerate our growth in key markets, return to organic sales growth in our Asia travel retail business, and skincare category, and to progressively rebuild margin across brands, categories, and regions. Let me now share more about our third quarter performance as numerous growth engines excelled. Looking at regions, each of the Americas and Asia-Pacific returned to organic sales growth, which complemented ongoing gains in the domestic markets of EMEA. Developed markets from every regions contributed, lead by the United States, U.K., and Hong Kong. While organic sales in our emerging markets grows an outstanding 17% globally. Impressively, in the domestic markets of EMEA we realized broad-based trends as every category grew double-digits organically. The breadth of growth engines by category was matched by the breadth of growth engines by channel, lead by specialty-multi and online [indiscernible], driven by the successful go-to-market strategy as we focus on high potential channels. In Western Europe, our brands successfully engaged with consumers to generate trial and repeat. The examples are many; Est\u00e9e Lauder, Bobbi Brown, and Too Faced driving vital success on TikTok, to M\u00b7A\u00b7C, leveraging Paris Fashion Week for its M\u00b7A\u00b7C Locked Kiss Ink lipstick launch, and La Mer hosting dermatologists for a unique event. This collective initiatives featuring enticing innovation in hero brands drove the company accelerating prestige beauty share gains for the quarter in Western Europe. Looking at Asia-Pacific, it similarly delivered diversified growth in nearly every market, and each category contributed to the regions return to organic sales growth. Fragrance was a standout, rising double-digit, fueled by excellent performance of our luxury and our seasonal portfolio, lead by Jo Malone London, Le Labo, and TOM FORD Beauty. These brands hero franchises welcome new consumers into the category, while locally inspire innovation and enriching in-store services further contributed to the expansion of this promising category in the region. Mainland China grew low single-digits organically, after four quarters of pressure from COVID-19 restrictions and outbreaks. The beginning of the quarter was impacted by the lingering effect of the COVID cases in November/December. In January, retailers were to existing inventory, extracting gradually returned, such that organic sales declined steep double-digits. As the reopening progressed, organic sales grows double-digit in each of February and March. Even in this complex quarter in Mainland China, consumer desire for high-quality products elevated experience as newness was clear, and our brands delivered, lead by Est\u00e9e Lauder and La Mer. For Est\u00e9e Lauder, skincare fueled its growth. Consumer gravitated to the brands innovation, and cheered across franchises, most especially its luxury-oriented ReNutriv, as well as Supreme. La Mer further contributed, boosted by its beauty advisor offering, differentiated services, and the launch of reformulated moisturizing soft cream, which attracted new consumer with its advanced benefits. Encouragingly for the third quarter, our prestige beauty share gains in Mainland China accelerated sequentially, driven by skincare as well as both online and brick-and-mortar. In the Americas, the United States returned to organic sales growth, invigorated by strategic go-to-market initiatives and innovation, to engage existing as well as new consumers. We're originally going to hero and winning streak of innovation with the latest being multi-peptide eye serum, which is bringing in the new consumer demographic. Est\u00e9e Lauder introduction of the revamped nutritious franchise focused on [Jed Zed] (ph) with all new skincare products and launched exclusively with Ulta Beauty realized strong initial uptake. Looking at makeup in the United States, M\u00b7A\u00b7C, Clinique, and Too Faced fueled excellent performance with targeting initiative to serve various consumer demographic across freestanding stores, specialty-multi, and department stores. For Clinique, it is a case study in successfully leveraging vital success of a product. In it's case, Almost Lipstick and Black Honey to drive organic sales growth in many sub categories. Across regions, emerging market showed their promise as a long-term growth engine. As our in-market team executed with excellence to meet the local needs of consumers, the double-digit organic sales growth in emerging market this quarter extends our fiscal year-to-date momentum with strong contribution from India and Brazil. Globally, our diverse portfolio brands served as a powerful catalyst for growth. M A C, Tom Ford Beauty, The Ordinary, and Le Labo each contributed strong organic sales growth and demonstrated again to be ahead across our large scale and developing brands. M A C with its global reach, [indiscernible] service-oriented freestanding stores continue to realize the evolution of the make-up renaissance as markets progressed in recovery from the pandemic. Furthermore, the brand leverage is market-leading EMV ranking with high [indiscernible] and product launches in makeup. Consumers also embraced M A C new Hyper Real franchise in skincare, which should represent an incremental growth engine for the brand over time. Importantly, Hyper Real is another example in our portfolio of exciting east to west innovation as it was born in Asia-Pacific and launched globally. Tom Ford Beauty delivered double-digit organic sales growth excelling across fragrance and make-up. In fragrance, The Private Blend Cherry Collection was an instant hit while the brand's extension of Tom Ford Noir Extreme Eau De Parfum into the parfum category the consumer seeking intensity and the highest quality. We are thrilled to having reached our brand portfolio last week when we acquired Tom Ford, the power play in luxury with promising growth opportunities ahead. The deal is a wonderful outcome of our successful journey with the brand, which began when we collaborated to create TOM FORD Beauty over 15 years ago. The Ordinary ingredient focused product prospered in its heritage as well as in new market evident by the brand's very successful February launch in the Middle East, while Le Labo continued to evolve from strength to strength globally, rising 60% organically. In closing, while we are lowering our outlook for fiscal year 2023 to reflect the deeper pressure in Asia travel retail, given its standard recovery and related retail inventory tightening, we are encouraged by the strong momentum in the rest of our business. Looking ahead, we are focused on a strong acceleration, balanced organic sales growth across regions, categories, and channels and progressively rebuilding margin. Indeed, consumer demand is robust for our diverse portfolio brands in developed and emerging markets globally evidenced in both organic sales growth and retail sales trends. This drives our confidence in the future. To our employees, I extend my deepest gratitude for your exceptional dedication to our company and each other amid a difficult external environment. You have demonstrated an unwavering passion to exceed consumer desires around the world with our beautiful portfolio brands. I will now turn the call over to Tracey.\nTracey Travis: Thank you, Fabrizio, and hello, everyone. Our third quarter organic net sales declined 8% and earnings per share decreased 75% to $0.47. As Fabrizio mentioned despite continued challenges in our Asia travel retail business, we experienced accelerated growth across our markets globally with nearly every market expanding as they progressed through various stages of recovery from the pandemic. From a geographic standpoint, organic net sales in our Asia-Pacific region rose 7% with nearly all markets contributing led by Hong Kong which doubled in size partially due to the return of Chinese traveler while Australia grew nearly 50% and Japan rose double-digits, Mainland China also returned to growth this quarter, showing positive signs of recovery in February and March, after the pressure from the increase in COVID cases, and slower retail traffic in January. Throughout the regions, markets continue to progress and recovery with fewer COVID restrictions compared to last year, leading to growth in all product categories, with the return of brick-and-mortar traffic. Strong double-digit growth from the regions in emerging markets contributed one point to Asia-Pacific's growth. Organic net sales in the Americas grew 6%, lead by the United States. In North America, organic net sales grew mid single-digits, reflecting growth in skincare, makeup, and fragrance. The Ordinary, M\u00b7A\u00b7C, and Le Labo excelled, each rising double-digits in the quarter. Specialty multi-growth including distribution expansion drove the increase in brick-and-mortar along with contributions from freestanding stores and department stores. In Latin America, organic net sales grew double-digits, benefiting from growth in every country and in all product categories with particular strength in makeup and fragrance. Organic net sales in our Europe, the Middle East, and Africa regions fell 24%, driven entirely by the travel retail business. Our global travel retail sales continue to be pressured by our Asia travel retail business, which Fabrizio described. Outside of Asia, we experienced double-digit sales growth in travel retail, as international travel increased throughout Europe, and the Americas. The overall performance in travel retail more than offset the organic net sales growth from the rest of the EMEA region, where we drove strong performance in all product categories and from nearly all channels of distribution. Organic net sales rose across both developed and emerging markets, lead by the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, and Turkey, as the progression to recovery continued, and tourism resumed. From a category standpoint, fragrance continued its momentum as organic net sales rose 14%. Strong demand for our products and high-touch services as well as innovation fueled growth across every geographic region. TOM FORD Beauty, Le Labo, and Est\u00e9e Lauder each grew double-digits in the quarter. Organic net sales in hair care grew 3%, and sales were virtually flat in makeup. Makeup growth in the Americas, Asia-Pacific, and the markets in EMEA, excluding travel retail was offset by the pressures in Asia travel retail. M\u00b7A\u00b7C and Clinique continue to drive makeup recovery, and double-digit growth from TOM FORD Beauty and Too Faced also contributed. Nearly every market in Asia-Pacific realized strong growth in the category, partially offset by softness in Mainland China. Organic net sales in skincare fell 17%, due to the pressures affecting Asia travel retail. The declines from La Mer and Est\u00e9e Lauder were partially offset by standout performance from The Ordinary and M\u00b7A\u00b7C. The Ordinary benefited from strong growth in specialty multi-channel, particularly in the U.S., as well as from geographic expansion into India and the Middle East this year, as well as the success of new product innovation. The launch of M\u00b7A\u00b7C hyper-real product franchise expanded its offering in the category, and contributed to growth. Our gross margin declined 750 basis points compared to last year, largely due to the slower-than-expected recovery in Asia travel retail. This includes obsolescence charges, higher promotional costs, and gets that to drive increased consumption, excess overhead absorption in our plants due to the pull down of production throughout the year, given higher inventory levels, and less favorable brand and category mix. Operating expenses increased 570 basis points as a percent of sales, driven largely by the reduction in sales. We continued our investments to support recovery markets in areas such as advertising, promotional activities, and innovation, which collectively increased 230 basis points, compared to last year. Operating income declined 66% to $360 million, and our operating margin contracted 1,320 basis points to 8.4% in the quarter. Despite the volatility that has significantly impacted net sales we have sustained certain of our strategic investments to support recovery in select markets, and the strengthening of our multiple engines of growth. We continue to invest in areas inherited to long-term profitable growth, including innovation, advertising, the growth of our emerging markets, the geographic expansion of some of our brands, production capacity, and consumer engagement. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 43.1%, compared to 21.3% last year. The increase in rate was primarily due to the expected further reduction in earnings, related to our travel retail business for fiscal 2023. Diluted EPS of $0.47 decreased 75% compared to last year. This was at the high-end of our outlook, despite the significantly higher-than-normal tax rate. The impact from foreign currency translation and foreign currency transactions in key travel retail locations negatively impacted diluted EPS by 1%, and 3% respectively. For the nine months, we generated $1 billion in net cash flows from operating activity, compared to $2 billion last year. The decline from last year reflects lower net income, partially offset by lower working capital. We invested $652 million in capital expenditures, and we returned $945 million in cash to stockholders through both dividends and share repurchases. On April 28, we were pleased to complete the acquisition of the TOM FORD brand. The amounts paid at closing of approximately $2.25 billion were funded through a combination of cash, including the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper, and $250 million received from one of the licensees of the brand, Marcolin. An additional aggregate amount of $300 million in deferred payments and 5% interest per annum to the sellers become due from the company, beginning in July, 2025. We estimate an EPS dilution to the full-year of approximately $0.03 to $0.04. And now turning to our outlook for fiscal 2023, clearly this fiscal year has proven to be a perfect storm of higher-than-anticipated volatility, from both global, external headwinds and uncertainties surrounding the timing and pace of recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily in China and Asia travel retail. In August, we expected a gradual improvement throughout the first-half of the fiscal year, as markets in international travel began to recover from the impacts of COVID restrictions. However, the actual impacts to our business in Asia travel retail and China to a lesser extent have been far greater than we anticipated, given the prolonged challenges from the pandemic, including a slower-than-expected recovery of traffic and sales conversion in prestige beauty in these markets. Further compounding this pressure is the tightening of inventory by retailers in Hainan. We now expect that a far more gradual return to normal sales growth in Asia travel retail is likely to persist into the first-half of fiscal 2024. In addition, higher inflation and currency volatility as well as promotions in certain markets to alleviate high stock levels more than offset our price increases, and further pressured our business margins. In sight of the volatility in Asia travel retail that delayed the recovery relative to what we had expected, as well as the macro pressures from inflation and currency, we have been encouraged by the faster-than-anticipated improvements across many of our markets globally, as they progress through various stages of recovery from the pandemic. While we are lowering our full-year outlook to reflect continued decline in net sales in Asia travel retail, including the tightening of inventory by certain retailers, we plan to invest in markets where traffic and consumption are returning, and expect to return to overall net sales growth in the fourth quarter. This reflects double-digit sales growth in the Asia-Pacific region, including Mainland China, as well as in EMEA, excluding Asia travel retail. The Americas has planned to grow single-digits. Currency also continues to pressure margins relative to prior year. As Fabrizio mentioned, we are certainly not satisfied with our results this fiscal year, and will address plans to progressively rebuild the margin accretive areas of our business beyond this fiscal year from the current year's level. When full recovery does occur from the pandemic, we do expect the return to healthy growth of our Asia travel retail business, and in our related skincare category supported by a more normalized level of investment in selling, advertising and promotional activities, reflective of the increased brick-and-mortar traffic. With these assumptions as our backdrop and using March 31st spot rate of 1.09 for the euro, 1.239 for the pound, 6.872 for the yuan, and 12.97 for the Korean won, we now forecast organic net sales for the full-year to decline 75%. Currency translation is expected to dilute reported sales growth for the full fiscal year by 4 percentage points. And we anticipate an additional 1 point of dilution from the impact of certain foreign currency transactions and key international travel retail locations. The impact of sales from certain designer license access is expected to dilute reported growth by approximately 1 point. Full-year operating margin is forecasted to be approximately 11.1%. An 860 basis point contraction from the prior year period, primarily due to the disruptions from COVID restrictions that not only impacted sales in Asia travel retail and Mainland China but also resulted in increased obsolescence charges, discounts and promotional expenses. Foreign currency impact and the strategic investments, I mentioned previously. are also expected to pressure margin. We now expect our full-year effective tax rate to be approximately 27%, reflecting the change in our estimated geographical mix of earnings for the balance of the year. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $3.29 and $3.39 before restructuring and other charges. And, includes the expected impact of the Tom Ford acquisition I mentioned previously. This includes approximately $0.26 of dilution from currency translation. In constant currency, we expect EPS to decline approximately 51% which includes a negative impact from foreign currency transactions in key international travel retail location of approximately four percentage points. While this has been a challenging and disappointing year, navigating through many uncertainties the strength we are seeing in many of our recovery market gives us tremendous optimism for the future. Our long-term fundamentals and strategy remain intact as does our confidence in the long-term growth opportunity for global prestige beauty in our brands with the investments we have made to sustain long-term profitable growth. On behalf of Fabrizio and the Est\u00e9e Lauder company's leadership team, we want to extend our immense gratitude to all of our employees around the world. We recognize that this has been an incredibly challenging year for you. And we want to thank you for your extraordinary efforts through dedication and commitment to the company and your resilience as we continue together on our path to recovery. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We will be happy to take your questions at this time.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey, good morning, guys. So, I just wanted to touch on the three areas of weakness versus your guidance in terms how Korea and China taking a step back, the magnitude of changes to your guidance stemming from the areas is obviously severe, and it also looks more onerous than peers. So, just as you take a step back and look at the weakness versus what was expected, how much of that is do you think more just a timing of recovery in beauty at the consumer level coming out of COVID, or retail inventory issues, which [inferior] (ph) more shorter term versus the potential for the longer term recovery in beauty category is low in these areas, so, really just perspective on lower long-term sales potential versus more short-term issues? And I know it's hard to speak relative to peer results and guidance, but it does look like the issues are more severe for Est\u00e9e versus peers. So, just any perspective on Est\u00e9e's market share company performance in these areas would also be helpful. Thanks.\nTracey Travis: Okay, Dara, so thank you for the question. In Hainan, as we said in the prepared remarks, we are starting to see during the quarter passenger traffic comeback in Hainan, and that's been very positive. As Fabrizio mentioned in his prepared remarks, we had a group that was in Hainan a few weeks back and saw quite a bit of activity. So, we are very encouraged, and in fact, Hainan actually reflected the positive retail sales in the third quarter. So, this is the first quarter, the Hainan performance for us has been up and down all year. And some of the swings have been quite severe, but we did see a progression to positive retail sales. I think the thing that gives us more comfort now on a more continuous steady progression of recovery is the fact that the COVID restrictions have been lifted. And so, what we were experiencing before with our travel retail business is the volatility related to some of the COVID restrictions and the flow of traffic and travel, and people's comfort with travel. So, that gives us more comfort that we are going to see a recovery. In terms of our experience as it relates to the business and why it has been as significant as it is because when you look back at the beginning of this year, we had very strong momentum coming into the year in travel retail, in Hainan in particular, our July results were up strong double-digit. Then, Hainan went into closure. And that extended for longer than we had anticipated, but given the results we have seen in July and actually in some previous months, we had expected that that recovery would happen faster once the lockdown was lifted, and that didn't happen. And our retailers also expected that recovery. We ended up with more inventory in the trade than what was needed basically for the level of sales that were being done in Hainan. So, our pullback in inventory right now given the pace of recovery that we are seeing, again we encouraged, but the retail inventory needs to come down. And therefore, we are pulling back on our shipments. Korea, we talked about in the last call in terms of what happened in Korea. We basically have a change in the rollback of COVID-19 related supportive measures with Korean duty free operators, and that too was pretty sudden in the third quarter. The expectation is that we will see travelers come back to Korea and come back to duty-free shopping in Korea, but that has not happened yet. Korea benefits from having a lot of organized tour business from Chinese traveling consumers, and that has been slower to come back. So, that certainly is pressuring our fourth quarter as well. And again, it has been difficult to predict the timing of all of this recovery, but we do know the recovery is happening. So, we don't believe there is an issue at all with prestige beauty. When we are look at the recovery we are seeing in the Americas, in other Asia-Pac region, in EMEA, we see very strong recovery of prestige beauty, and actually you are seeing an acceleration of fragrance, makeup, and skincare. So, it really is based on what we are seeing in other regions given they are further along in the recovery relative to some of the regions that you asked about.\nFabrizio Freda: And Dara, I just want to add -- so, as Tracey explained, in theory it's really an issue of inventory versus stage of recovery. Another proof of that is our retail in travel retails is so much stronger than our net. So, we had a minus 45% in quarter three versus a single-digit decline in retail. So, there is a lot of inventory absorption which is going on with the recovery. And, a lot of the speed of this absorption will depend on the speed of the recovery that we have in front in us. We are estimating that given the trend in this period in the quarter four, retail will go positive. And then, the absorption will continue to improve over time. And eventually continue in quarter 1 of next fiscal year. Other encouraging point, I want to touch briefly the China that you asked also about. So, in China we returned to organic growth which is excellent news. And we expect the double-digit growth in quarter four in China Mainland. We accelerate the market share gains for the second quarter in a row, and I want to underline that when the problem with the volatility in China started in the period where Shanghai was closed, and we were particularly affected by the closure of Shanghai. At the moment, during these three months of closure, we lost significant market share. Now, the good news, we now essentially made that for the lost market share from the lockdown. We are back in line with the total market share that we expect in quarter four, because also of the low base to get into a positive market share growth versus also the pre-lockdown period, which is a store gain, we said, that would have tried to recover these in one year, and we will do that and better than that. The other important thing to underline that linked to this TR issue that is the skincare issue, because there is a high percentage of skincare, which is a very profitable category for us. And I want to also underline that skincare is growing, the asking rate is growing globally by 6% percent. So, we are growing skincare. We are growing skincare in China Mainland. Our retail is growing ahead of the market that we are building market share in quarter three, and we expect to do even more in quarter four. And Est\u00e9e Lauder and La Mer is driving this growth, with La Mer growing double-digit retail in the quarter in China, and Lauder single-digit. So, the last part of your question is our different situation versus peers, I would say that if you look at business overall, the answer of the difference is in the level of stocks, in the TR and the volatility, and the fact that we are bigger in the historical to the strong accretive channel that in a moment of crisis obviously resulted into a big negative.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Chris Carey from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.\nChris Carey: Hi, good morning everyone.\nFabrizio Freda: Good morning.\nChris Carey: So, you know, I guess just I think these revolved in taking Dara's question, in consideration, I guess it's like APAC and Americas actually exceeded expectations, which in a way probably helped come back this dynamics, if it's a category or brand or stockholder issue. I think it's also probably not fully understood that L'Or\u00e9al and others have much smaller travel retail businesses, maybe understood, but I guess the question is, clearly you have created a unique business where you're more bigger in travel retail than many of your peers, and this has been something that's been growing over the last several years, and obviously that created a lot of great tailwinds during the up move, but it's just created an enormous amount of volatility, and I think also a lot of visibility as we come into this kind of downtrend, right? And I hear you on rebuilding demand-evolving activities and remaining at markets, but I just wonder this market needs to reset lower before you can really talk about validation or are we really just -- we got one more quarter of two of issues, and any more really rebuilding from there, right? And I appreciate Korea and China all have different dynamics, but I think the overall context here is certainly the travel retail business is creating a ton of volatility for your business? And then, just related to that, and I apologize, but the fiscal Q4 guidance range is quite wide, and I think that maybe sees the visibility kicking in. Can you maybe just talk about how you might be approaching the concept of this guidance, given the lack of visibility, so that perhaps we can maybe avoid some of these resets? So, thank you so much for that perspective, I very much appreciate it.\nFabrizio Freda: Okay, let me start. Thank you for the question. Our point of view is that, as you said, this is kind of over reset, but then after this reset, travel retail will remain a large very important channel, because it's an important channel also for consumer acquisition, and it's a growing channel. And so, to grow global market share, to be strong in channel retail with remaining is important, also in the case of Asia travel retail and China travel retail is very important for coverage, because in many emerging markets for China the coverage of more cities is possible via online and via the people travel, because the brick-and-mortars are not there, are owning a part of the city, which is the reason of high productivity in China. So, travel retail is also a great opportunity for discovering product for the physical experience for interacting with our product. And these are very luxury channel, meaning the experience of luxuries they have. So, the issue with travel retail has been really during the pandemic the volatility of travel and the interest and the possibility of travel so much impacted the regulation change. The pandemic up and downs et cetera obviously in a moment of the pandemic moment travel retail has been more difficult to predict, and has been more volatile to anticipate. But in terms of the positives of the channel in the long-term for brand building, for trial building, for being in accretive and positive profitable channel in the long-term remains in tact. And so, we believe that out of the pandemic this will be an important channel. Now, will this be more balanced growth? Absolutely. We have a plan and an interest in balancing our growth and balancing the proportion between all of our business segments, and we will continue to do that.  The other thing I want to underline that the high inventories, Tracey explained, what was the sequence of events, and the reason why our retailers went for higher inventories, at the beginning of the fiscal year and then we encountered this lower recovery than anticipated, and remember the important thing is lower recovery, also the retailers want less talk. And so, the replenishment gets affected as Tracey explained. So, this situation is also impacted by our relatively long supply chain, where you need to order and then after that you receive it, the relatively long supply chain has an impact on the fact that the retailers when they decided their stock for us, which is not true for every one of our peers, they need to make a bet several months before when they receive the products. And that issue obviously enabled the worst volatility we have ever experienced, for our retailers and for us to estimate with such anticipation. So, we are acting on this. All the investment we have done, which in part are visible in our short-term profitability pressure, like the manufacturing that we call Sakura in Japan, that the new distribution center in Mainland China and in the near future in Hainan, all designed this investment to shorten delivery time. Now the shortening of delivery time will also reduce the risk of being wrong in the choices in volatile moments. And so, I assume a certain amount of volatility will continue even after the pandemic we have done investment to reduce our risk into our ability to manage better in a volatile period. The other thing is let's not under-evaluate the investment in retail guidance that will reduce -- that will increase the speed of innovation, reduce the timelines of innovation, as well, and we'll add another impact of better ability to make -- reduce the volatility, because faster activity, in other words, with agility, and agility is one of the things that will make our future ability to forecast in the correct way. So, in summary, we count on continue having a strong business in the future. The reset that our retailers and the market are doing for us, but after that we will continue to grow in a more balanced way, and with better agility to make the right forecast.\nTracey Travis: So, as Fabrizio said, we have made some structural changes to the business that going forward should allow us to manage volatility. Hopefully we will see the level of volatility that we have seen certainly over the past year, but we will have more agility in our operations. To your question on the fourth quarter and what's in our implied guidance, as it relates to travel retail, coming off of the trends that we are seeing in March, the progress of trends that we're seeing through the third quarter, we are expecting that our retail sales and travel retail will be up double-digits, and our net sales are down double-digits, more than our retails are up. So, again, this is another quarter of trying to -- we have little down the inventory that's in the trade, hence the impact that you see in the fourth quarter, and as Fabrizio said, much of that being our very strong skincare business. So, we do expect, as I said in my prepared remarks that some of this will bleed into the first quarter, and perhaps a little bit into the second quarter, but get progressively better. And so, we get to the inventory levels that both we and our customers want in the trade. We are working with and partnering with our customers on their programs, also now that traffic increase back in airports, we are investing in advertising in airports, we are employing some of the sales staffs that was not there when the airports were empty, and we are working with our brands on great programs and promotions for customers as they return to airports. So, our travel retail team has been quite busy working with our retailers to recapture the growth that we are now seeing, in particular, in Hainan and hopefully soon in Korea as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question.\nRupesh Parikh: Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. So, obviously you had a step back in your earnings power. I am trying to get a sense in terms of how you guys think about the profitability of getting back to 20% operating margins in earnings north of seven. So, I'm just trying to better understand how you guys are thinking about the proper recovery.\nTracey Travis: So, thank you for the question. I said in the prepared remarks, we expect off of this year, which obviously has been a big setback year for the reasons that we've spoken about, out highest margin category and a very high margin channel being pressured. We do expect a progressive recovery in margin, but that does mean not back to 19% in fiscal '24. And so, we are taking cost actions as we always do. We certainly have cost control measures in place as it relates to areas like headcount, consulting expenses, other expenses as well. And we are in the process now finalizing our budgets for fiscal '24, and certainly will have better information for you in terms of what that margin progression looks like for fiscal '24 in our August call. But it certainly will be more than 50 basis points of margin expansion off of its level, but certainly not to the 19% level.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Oliver Chen from TD Cowen. Please go ahead with your question.\nOliver Chen: Hi. Thanks, Fabrizio and Tracey. I was curious about what your most concerns are about for ongoing risk related to your guidance as we have seen. You called out promos and volatility as well as there are uncontrollable factors about regarding the inventory and the channel. And as we think more broadly, you called that previously losing share in independent brands and opportunities in royalty as well as customer data programs, what's your take on how that may give an opportunity going forward as well? Thank you.\nTracey Travis: Yes. I mean in the prepared remarks, Oliver, we talked about areas that we are gaining share, and so, I think we are seeing strong momentum in some of the recovery markets that are gaining share, inclusive of China, and China is a real indicator for what we can expect when some of the areas that have been suppressed this year, like travel retail Hainan and in Korea when Chinese traveling consumers returned to Korea. So, I think those things are quite positive. We have strong innovation programs as well to support our growth for certainly next year as well. And the fact again, the biggest volatility that we've seen this year has been in some of the COVID restrictions in certain markets that had been lifted. And so, now it's a matter of the timing in case of that recovery. We see a little bit better, but I'm a bit cautious obviously given what we have experienced this year, but recognizing that trigger is one that really has created as much volatility for the reasons that we have already spoken about. We are feeling a bit better. There will be still volatility certainly in the fourth quarter, and there will be volatility next year, but we have always been a company that's been relatively good at managing volatility, this year, given the severity of it, and the severity in the channel of operation that it happened has caused us to have these results, but rest assured, myself, Fabrizio and the entire management team are diligently working on recovering our profitability, and certainly recovering growth, and our brands continue to be very strong with consumers.\nFabrizio Freda: Yes, and just to add, Tracey explained everything, but I want to tell you that our retail globally is strong, and in our key markets we're also growing market share. I already said it, but I want to repeat it, the market share growth in China Mainland is really encouraging, because we already made that all work was lost in the Shanghai closure period. The market share growth in EMEA is very strong, and market share growth in many emerging markets and emerging markets in total is very strong. I said it before; our emerging markets are growing 17%. The market is growing about less than 17%, in some of emerging markets, in North America we are growing again, although not in the U.S. market share, but we are growing market shares in Latin America and many other places. So, our demand is very strong. And the other thing that I mentioned already the several brands, which are doing well, is very encouraging, but I believe in this quarter the key attention is on skincare. And on skincare, we have La Mer growing, Est\u00e9e Lauder doing well also in China. We have double-digits skincare growth in Europe and Latin America. We have single-digit skincare growth in U.S. but again, back to growth. We have an exciting innovation plan as Tracey said, but let me give you a few examples; we just launched Clinique, we also surged one of our SPC, so new sample protection, and The Original and multi-peptide eye serum, we had launched The Original in India and Middle East with extraordinary results, M\u00b7A\u00b7C had a real, meaning the skincare market, the skincare Bobbi Brown are very strong. So, all the skincare makeup brands is a new trends where we are leveraging very well with good success, and importantly, we had our hero upgrades in the high luxury area. So, La Mer Supreme, ReNutriv Ultimate Diamond, which are going out that are very important for the Asia trends, where luxury skincare is growing more than skincare in general on average. So, a lot of signs of strength in the fundamentals of consumption of demand of desirability of our brands are very evident. We're going through an inventory issue, and with the profit pressure created by this tight inventory issue, and we are going through focus on sellout, retail acceleration, and profit building as the next steps.\nOperator: And we have time for one additional question. This question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.\nLauren Lieberman: Great, thanks. Good morning. So, one thing that hasn't come up is just visibility into what's in \"Inventory\" outside of traditional retail, and we know that, Fabrizio, you have spoken many times over the years about travel corridor shifting, and particularly, we think about the further development of Asia travel retail broadly, but there is also shoppers that move around and buy in bulk, and there has been a lot of conversation in the industry about visibility and controlled around that practice, and the degree to which that was a huge driver of Korea travel retail during these lighter regulation of problem supported measures. So, I heard your comments on encouraging progression on share and retail sales turning positive in Hainan and so on, but I was curious about what you're doing, I guess (a) visibility into kind of untracked retail, if you will, (b), anything that you were thinking about changing control-wise to sort of have a better read on the quality of sales going out the door from some of your travel retail channels? And then finally, kind of putting clarity on all of it, do you expect the inventory drawdown dynamic to be completed in the fourth quarter, or should we think about there's still being a mismatch between sell-in being down and sell-through into the first quarter of '24? Thanks.\nTracey Travis: So, Lauren, let me take that last one. Yes, we do expect that our sales will be down again in the first quarter, and pick up in the second quarter. And so, that's the cadence that we are seeing right now. Again, it much depends on retail sales, and again, as we said, we are encouraged by how retails sales have picked up in Hainan, not as much in Korea at the moment, but we remain encouraged that will happen as well. So, the pace of retail, which has been slower, again than we expected this year, will determine how quickly we resume shipments. We do have some very exacting new products that we do hope that we can actually ship them in the first and second quarter, but again, with the activities that we have going on with our travel retail partners I believe that we will see a continued acceleration of retail like we started to see in this quarter.\nFabrizio Freda: Yes. And Lauren to answer the first part of your question, we sell to our authorized retail customer. We do not sell directly to their goods. However, as you alluded to, during COVID, there has been some temporary government policies, for example, in Korea, were put in place to support the travel businesses, and the travel retailers in this very tough moment, where we they reached to go bankrupt, because everything was paused. So, now that -- and you're right there is not complete visibility on that part, there was no complete visibility on that part, what they were doing in that moment when the policies were allowed. Now these policies are changing. There is an interest of the industry in general in our retailers, which is the most important factors in this, there is an interest in going back to regular travel, as regular travels go, because this is a more profitable, and more interesting business for them as well. So, now that airport traffics is gradually recovering, we expect a rebalancing of the total market, and because of this, we expect an increased visibility on all of these areas, and we are also putting extra focus as Tracey explained before, on retail sell-out on to regular travels. With new investment we are rebuilding the people, the staff in the airports, we are rebuilding the advertising there, for what Tracey already established, that with our interest is to support our retailers in this transition, and we are really pushing building this transition at the maximum speed. And so, there's been during COVID less visibility. There will be more visibility in the future, and more control.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's question-and-answer session, as well as today's presentation.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Fabrizio Freda",
            "content": "Thank you, Rainey, and hello to everyone. We appreciate you being with us today to discuss our third quarter results, and revised outlook for fiscal year 2023. In the third quarter, organic sales fell 8% at the high-end of our outlook range, and the sequential improvements from the decline of 11% in the second quarter. Nearly all developed and emerging markets grew organically, and outperformed our expectations to offset an even lower-than-expected recovery in our Asia travel retail business. As we discussed in February, Asia travel retail faced two headwinds in the third quarter. The first, elevated inventory in Hainan, given retailers 'expectation for a more accelerated recovery proved very challenging, as conversion of travelers to consumers in prestige beauty lagged historical trends, as travels initially gravitated through other categories. This led to even lower replenishment orders than we anticipated. The second headwinds, the transition in Korea to post-pandemic regulations as traveling consumers gradually returned pressured sales meaningfully. In China and Korea, the resumption of international flight was subdued. Limited visas were granted, and group tours were slow to restart. These factors resulted in lower-than-expected traffic in airports throughout the region, which combined with a lower-than-expected conversion further moderated replenishment orders. With this said, there were bright spots for travel retail in Hong Kong, Macau, Europe, and the Americas. All told, global travel retail organic sales declined 45%. This was partially offset by excellent organic sales growth of 10% in the rest of our global business. Our retail sales growth was even stronger than organic sales growth in many markets around the world, including China and the U.S. Encouragingly, retail sales performance is significantly ahead of organic sales result in global travel retail, which gives us confidence that the challenges in travel retail are abating with time. Furthermore, this strength at retail, including prestige beauty share gains in many markets demonstrated a benefit of our continuing investment in innovation and building the desirability of our brand around the world. This positive retail trends are expected to continue in the fourth quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS in the fiscal third quarter fell 75%, which was also at the high-end of our outlook. We invested to fuel market in various stages of post pandemic recovery, launching sought after innovation, expanding brand into markets, and increasing advertising as percentage of sales. As the shape recovery for Asia travel retail comes into better focus, it is proving to be both far more volatile than we expected, and more gradual relative to what we experienced in other markets. We are therefore lowering our organic sales and EPS outlook for fiscal year 2023, as we reduced our implied fourth quarter outlook, primarily for Asia travel retail. For Asia travel retail, there are two factors driving our revised outlook. In Hainan, the pressure from elevated inventory in the trade is proving to be deeper and longer-lasting, driven by this lower-than-expected consumption trend I discussed compounded by the retailer inventory tightening. Second, the resumption of international travel by Chinese consumer is evolving more slowly than we anticipated. Having visited Shanghai and Hainan in March, and witnessed firsthand the optimism of consumers, retailers, [fashionists] (ph), and our local teams, I am very encouraged for the future of our business with the Chinese consumers. I also had the good fortune to officially open our new China Innovation Lab, and met with the amazing scientist and product development specialist in the state-of-art R&D facility which further bolstered my confidence in the business fundamentals. Indeed, the opportunity for prestige beauty and our brands with the Chinese consumer in the mid- to-long term remains vibrant in the domestic market, in Hainan and internationally, which remains our focus through this complex phase of recovery from the pandemic. For our fourth quarter outlook, the far slower organic sales growth that we anticipated in February is impacting profitability significantly. There are two factors at play be under pressure to a bigger margin accretive area of our business. First, with the rest of the business growing strongly, we will continue to invest to drive the momentum in those areas. Second, strategic and necessary long-term investments in manufacturing, R&D, and information technology capabilities are pressuring margin with the slow recovery of sales. With this said, we are obviously not satisfied by the profitability in our revised outlook for fiscal year 2023. For the future, we are focused on a plan to further accelerate our growth in key markets, return to organic sales growth in our Asia travel retail business, and skincare category, and to progressively rebuild margin across brands, categories, and regions. Let me now share more about our third quarter performance as numerous growth engines excelled. Looking at regions, each of the Americas and Asia-Pacific returned to organic sales growth, which complemented ongoing gains in the domestic markets of EMEA. Developed markets from every regions contributed, lead by the United States, U.K., and Hong Kong. While organic sales in our emerging markets grows an outstanding 17% globally. Impressively, in the domestic markets of EMEA we realized broad-based trends as every category grew double-digits organically. The breadth of growth engines by category was matched by the breadth of growth engines by channel, lead by specialty-multi and online [indiscernible], driven by the successful go-to-market strategy as we focus on high potential channels. In Western Europe, our brands successfully engaged with consumers to generate trial and repeat. The examples are many; Este\u0301e Lauder, Bobbi Brown, and Too Faced driving vital success on TikTok, to M\u00b7A\u00b7C, leveraging Paris Fashion Week for its M\u00b7A\u00b7C Locked Kiss Ink lipstick launch, and La Mer hosting dermatologists for a unique event. This collective initiatives featuring enticing innovation in hero brands drove the company accelerating prestige beauty share gains for the quarter in Western Europe. Looking at Asia-Pacific, it similarly delivered diversified growth in nearly every market, and each category contributed to the regions return to organic sales growth. Fragrance was a standout, rising double-digit, fueled by excellent performance of our luxury and our seasonal portfolio, lead by Jo Malone London, Le Labo, and TOM FORD Beauty. These brands hero franchises welcome new consumers into the category, while locally inspire innovation and enriching in-store services further contributed to the expansion of this promising category in the region. Mainland China grew low single-digits organically, after four quarters of pressure from COVID-19 restrictions and outbreaks. The beginning of the quarter was impacted by the lingering effect of the COVID cases in November/December. In January, retailers were to existing inventory, extracting gradually returned, such that organic sales declined steep double-digits. As the reopening progressed, organic sales grows double-digit in each of February and March. Even in this complex quarter in Mainland China, consumer desire for high-quality products elevated experience as newness was clear, and our brands delivered, lead by Este\u0301e Lauder and La Mer. For Este\u0301e Lauder, skincare fueled its growth. Consumer gravitated to the brands innovation, and cheered across franchises, most especially its luxury-oriented ReNutriv, as well as Supreme. La Mer further contributed, boosted by its beauty advisor offering, differentiated services, and the launch of reformulated moisturizing soft cream, which attracted new consumer with its advanced benefits. Encouragingly for the third quarter, our prestige beauty share gains in Mainland China accelerated sequentially, driven by skincare as well as both online and brick-and-mortar. In the Americas, the United States returned to organic sales growth, invigorated by strategic go-to-market initiatives and innovation, to engage existing as well as new consumers. We're originally going to hero and winning streak of innovation with the latest being multi-peptide eye serum, which is bringing in the new consumer demographic. Este\u0301e Lauder introduction of the revamped nutritious franchise focused on [Jed Zed] (ph) with all new skincare products and launched exclusively with Ulta Beauty realized strong initial uptake. Looking at makeup in the United States, M\u00b7A\u00b7C, Clinique, and Too Faced fueled excellent performance with targeting initiative to serve various consumer demographic across freestanding stores, specialty-multi, and department stores. For Clinique, it is a case study in successfully leveraging vital success of a product. In it's case, Almost Lipstick and Black Honey to drive organic sales growth in many sub categories. Across regions, emerging market showed their promise as a long-term growth engine. As our in-market team executed with excellence to meet the local needs of consumers, the double-digit organic sales growth in emerging market this quarter extends our fiscal year-to-date momentum with strong contribution from India and Brazil. Globally, our diverse portfolio brands served as a powerful catalyst for growth. M A C, Tom Ford Beauty, The Ordinary, and Le Labo each contributed strong organic sales growth and demonstrated again to be ahead across our large scale and developing brands. M A C with its global reach, [indiscernible] service-oriented freestanding stores continue to realize the evolution of the make-up renaissance as markets progressed in recovery from the pandemic. Furthermore, the brand leverage is market-leading EMV ranking with high [indiscernible] and product launches in makeup. Consumers also embraced M A C new Hyper Real franchise in skincare, which should represent an incremental growth engine for the brand over time. Importantly, Hyper Real is another example in our portfolio of exciting east to west innovation as it was born in Asia-Pacific and launched globally. Tom Ford Beauty delivered double-digit organic sales growth excelling across fragrance and make-up. In fragrance, The Private Blend Cherry Collection was an instant hit while the brand's extension of Tom Ford Noir Extreme Eau De Parfum into the parfum category the consumer seeking intensity and the highest quality. We are thrilled to having reached our brand portfolio last week when we acquired Tom Ford, the power play in luxury with promising growth opportunities ahead. The deal is a wonderful outcome of our successful journey with the brand, which began when we collaborated to create TOM FORD Beauty over 15 years ago. The Ordinary ingredient focused product prospered in its heritage as well as in new market evident by the brand's very successful February launch in the Middle East, while Le Labo continued to evolve from strength to strength globally, rising 60% organically. In closing, while we are lowering our outlook for fiscal year 2023 to reflect the deeper pressure in Asia travel retail, given its standard recovery and related retail inventory tightening, we are encouraged by the strong momentum in the rest of our business. Looking ahead, we are focused on a strong acceleration, balanced organic sales growth across regions, categories, and channels and progressively rebuilding margin. Indeed, consumer demand is robust for our diverse portfolio brands in developed and emerging markets globally evidenced in both organic sales growth and retail sales trends. This drives our confidence in the future. To our employees, I extend my deepest gratitude for your exceptional dedication to our company and each other amid a difficult external environment. You have demonstrated an unwavering passion to exceed consumer desires around the world with our beautiful portfolio brands. I will now turn the call over to Tracey. And Dara, I just want to add -- so, as Tracey explained, in theory it's really an issue of inventory versus stage of recovery. Another proof of that is our retail in travel retails is so much stronger than our net. So, we had a minus 45% in quarter three versus a single-digit decline in retail. So, there is a lot of inventory absorption which is going on with the recovery. And, a lot of the speed of this absorption will depend on the speed of the recovery that we have in front in us. We are estimating that given the trend in this period in the quarter four, retail will go positive. And then, the absorption will continue to improve over time. And eventually continue in quarter 1 of next fiscal year. Other encouraging point, I want to touch briefly the China that you asked also about. So, in China we returned to organic growth which is excellent news. And we expect the double-digit growth in quarter four in China Mainland. We accelerate the market share gains for the second quarter in a row, and I want to underline that when the problem with the volatility in China started in the period where Shanghai was closed, and we were particularly affected by the closure of Shanghai. At the moment, during these three months of closure, we lost significant market share. Now, the good news, we now essentially made that for the lost market share from the lockdown. We are back in line with the total market share that we expect in quarter four, because also of the low base to get into a positive market share growth versus also the pre-lockdown period, which is a store gain, we said, that would have tried to recover these in one year, and we will do that and better than that. The other important thing to underline that linked to this TR issue that is the skincare issue, because there is a high percentage of skincare, which is a very profitable category for us. And I want to also underline that skincare is growing, the asking rate is growing globally by 6% percent. So, we are growing skincare. We are growing skincare in China Mainland. Our retail is growing ahead of the market that we are building market share in quarter three, and we expect to do even more in quarter four. And Este\u0301e Lauder and La Mer is driving this growth, with La Mer growing double-digit retail in the quarter in China, and Lauder single-digit. So, the last part of your question is our different situation versus peers, I would say that if you look at business overall, the answer of the difference is in the level of stocks, in the TR and the volatility, and the fact that we are bigger in the historical to the strong accretive channel that in a moment of crisis obviously resulted into a big negative. Good morning. Okay, let me start. Thank you for the question. Our point of view is that, as you said, this is kind of over reset, but then after this reset, travel retail will remain a large very important channel, because it's an important channel also for consumer acquisition, and it's a growing channel. And so, to grow global market share, to be strong in channel retail with remaining is important, also in the case of Asia travel retail and China travel retail is very important for coverage, because in many emerging markets for China the coverage of more cities is possible via online and via the people travel, because the brick-and-mortars are not there, are owning a part of the city, which is the reason of high productivity in China. So, travel retail is also a great opportunity for discovering product for the physical experience for interacting with our product. And these are very luxury channel, meaning the experience of luxuries they have. So, the issue with travel retail has been really during the pandemic the volatility of travel and the interest and the possibility of travel so much impacted the regulation change. The pandemic up and downs et cetera obviously in a moment of the pandemic moment travel retail has been more difficult to predict, and has been more volatile to anticipate. But in terms of the positives of the channel in the long-term for brand building, for trial building, for being in accretive and positive profitable channel in the long-term remains in tact. And so, we believe that out of the pandemic this will be an important channel. Now, will this be more balanced growth? Absolutely. We have a plan and an interest in balancing our growth and balancing the proportion between all of our business segments, and we will continue to do that.  The other thing I want to underline that the high inventories, Tracey explained, what was the sequence of events, and the reason why our retailers went for higher inventories, at the beginning of the fiscal year and then we encountered this lower recovery than anticipated, and remember the important thing is lower recovery, also the retailers want less talk. And so, the replenishment gets affected as Tracey explained. So, this situation is also impacted by our relatively long supply chain, where you need to order and then after that you receive it, the relatively long supply chain has an impact on the fact that the retailers when they decided their stock for us, which is not true for every one of our peers, they need to make a bet several months before when they receive the products. And that issue obviously enabled the worst volatility we have ever experienced, for our retailers and for us to estimate with such anticipation. So, we are acting on this. All the investment we have done, which in part are visible in our short-term profitability pressure, like the manufacturing that we call Sakura in Japan, that the new distribution center in Mainland China and in the near future in Hainan, all designed this investment to shorten delivery time. Now the shortening of delivery time will also reduce the risk of being wrong in the choices in volatile moments. And so, I assume a certain amount of volatility will continue even after the pandemic we have done investment to reduce our risk into our ability to manage better in a volatile period. The other thing is let's not under-evaluate the investment in retail guidance that will reduce -- that will increase the speed of innovation, reduce the timelines of innovation, as well, and we'll add another impact of better ability to make -- reduce the volatility, because faster activity, in other words, with agility, and agility is one of the things that will make our future ability to forecast in the correct way. So, in summary, we count on continue having a strong business in the future. The reset that our retailers and the market are doing for us, but after that we will continue to grow in a more balanced way, and with better agility to make the right forecast. Yes, and just to add, Tracey explained everything, but I want to tell you that our retail globally is strong, and in our key markets we're also growing market share. I already said it, but I want to repeat it, the market share growth in China Mainland is really encouraging, because we already made that all work was lost in the Shanghai closure period. The market share growth in EMEA is very strong, and market share growth in many emerging markets and emerging markets in total is very strong. I said it before; our emerging markets are growing 17%. The market is growing about less than 17%, in some of emerging markets, in North America we are growing again, although not in the U.S. market share, but we are growing market shares in Latin America and many other places. So, our demand is very strong. And the other thing that I mentioned already the several brands, which are doing well, is very encouraging, but I believe in this quarter the key attention is on skincare. And on skincare, we have La Mer growing, Este\u0301e Lauder doing well also in China. We have double-digits skincare growth in Europe and Latin America. We have single-digit skincare growth in U.S. but again, back to growth. We have an exciting innovation plan as Tracey said, but let me give you a few examples; we just launched Clinique, we also surged one of our SPC, so new sample protection, and The Original and multi-peptide eye serum, we had launched The Original in India and Middle East with extraordinary results, M\u00b7A\u00b7C had a real, meaning the skincare market, the skincare Bobbi Brown are very strong. So, all the skincare makeup brands is a new trends where we are leveraging very well with good success, and importantly, we had our hero upgrades in the high luxury area. So, La Mer Supreme, ReNutriv Ultimate Diamond, which are going out that are very important for the Asia trends, where luxury skincare is growing more than skincare in general on average. So, a lot of signs of strength in the fundamentals of consumption of demand of desirability of our brands are very evident. We're going through an inventory issue, and with the profit pressure created by this tight inventory issue, and we are going through focus on sellout, retail acceleration, and profit building as the next steps. Yes. And Lauren to answer the first part of your question, we sell to our authorized retail customer. We do not sell directly to their goods. However, as you alluded to, during COVID, there has been some temporary government policies, for example, in Korea, were put in place to support the travel businesses, and the travel retailers in this very tough moment, where we they reached to go bankrupt, because everything was paused. So, now that -- and you're right there is not complete visibility on that part, there was no complete visibility on that part, what they were doing in that moment when the policies were allowed. Now these policies are changing. There is an interest of the industry in general in our retailers, which is the most important factors in this, there is an interest in going back to regular travel, as regular travels go, because this is a more profitable, and more interesting business for them as well. So, now that airport traffics is gradually recovering, we expect a rebalancing of the total market, and because of this, we expect an increased visibility on all of these areas, and we are also putting extra focus as Tracey explained before, on retail sell-out on to regular travels. With new investment we are rebuilding the people, the staff in the airports, we are rebuilding the advertising there, for what Tracey already established, that with our interest is to support our retailers in this transition, and we are really pushing building this transition at the maximum speed. And so, there's been during COVID less visibility. There will be more visibility in the future, and more control."

            "content": "Thank you, Fabrizio, and hello, everyone. Our third quarter organic net sales declined 8% and earnings per share decreased 75% to $0.47. As Fabrizio mentioned despite continued challenges in our Asia travel retail business, we experienced accelerated growth across our markets globally with nearly every market expanding as they progressed through various stages of recovery from the pandemic. From a geographic standpoint, organic net sales in our Asia-Pacific region rose 7% with nearly all markets contributing led by Hong Kong which doubled in size partially due to the return of Chinese traveler while Australia grew nearly 50% and Japan rose double-digits, Mainland China also returned to growth this quarter, showing positive signs of recovery in February and March, after the pressure from the increase in COVID cases, and slower retail traffic in January. Throughout the regions, markets continue to progress and recovery with fewer COVID restrictions compared to last year, leading to growth in all product categories, with the return of brick-and-mortar traffic. Strong double-digit growth from the regions in emerging markets contributed one point to Asia-Pacific's growth. Organic net sales in the Americas grew 6%, lead by the United States. In North America, organic net sales grew mid single-digits, reflecting growth in skincare, makeup, and fragrance. The Ordinary, M\u00b7A\u00b7C, and Le Labo excelled, each rising double-digits in the quarter. Specialty multi-growth including distribution expansion drove the increase in brick-and-mortar along with contributions from freestanding stores and department stores. In Latin America, organic net sales grew double-digits, benefiting from growth in every country and in all product categories with particular strength in makeup and fragrance. Organic net sales in our Europe, the Middle East, and Africa regions fell 24%, driven entirely by the travel retail business. Our global travel retail sales continue to be pressured by our Asia travel retail business, which Fabrizio described. Outside of Asia, we experienced double-digit sales growth in travel retail, as international travel increased throughout Europe, and the Americas. The overall performance in travel retail more than offset the organic net sales growth from the rest of the EMEA region, where we drove strong performance in all product categories and from nearly all channels of distribution. Organic net sales rose across both developed and emerging markets, lead by the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, and Turkey, as the progression to recovery continued, and tourism resumed. From a category standpoint, fragrance continued its momentum as organic net sales rose 14%. Strong demand for our products and high-touch services as well as innovation fueled growth across every geographic region. TOM FORD Beauty, Le Labo, and Este\u0301e Lauder each grew double-digits in the quarter. Organic net sales in hair care grew 3%, and sales were virtually flat in makeup. Makeup growth in the Americas, Asia-Pacific, and the markets in EMEA, excluding travel retail was offset by the pressures in Asia travel retail. M\u00b7A\u00b7C and Clinique continue to drive makeup recovery, and double-digit growth from TOM FORD Beauty and Too Faced also contributed. Nearly every market in Asia-Pacific realized strong growth in the category, partially offset by softness in Mainland China. Organic net sales in skincare fell 17%, due to the pressures affecting Asia travel retail. The declines from La Mer and Este\u0301e Lauder were partially offset by standout performance from The Ordinary and M\u00b7A\u00b7C. The Ordinary benefited from strong growth in specialty multi-channel, particularly in the U.S., as well as from geographic expansion into India and the Middle East this year, as well as the success of new product innovation. The launch of M\u00b7A\u00b7C hyper-real product franchise expanded its offering in the category, and contributed to growth. Our gross margin declined 750 basis points compared to last year, largely due to the slower-than-expected recovery in Asia travel retail. This includes obsolescence charges, higher promotional costs, and gets that to drive increased consumption, excess overhead absorption in our plants due to the pull down of production throughout the year, given higher inventory levels, and less favorable brand and category mix. Operating expenses increased 570 basis points as a percent of sales, driven largely by the reduction in sales. We continued our investments to support recovery markets in areas such as advertising, promotional activities, and innovation, which collectively increased 230 basis points, compared to last year. Operating income declined 66% to $360 million, and our operating margin contracted 1,320 basis points to 8.4% in the quarter. Despite the volatility that has significantly impacted net sales we have sustained certain of our strategic investments to support recovery in select markets, and the strengthening of our multiple engines of growth. We continue to invest in areas inherited to long-term profitable growth, including innovation, advertising, the growth of our emerging markets, the geographic expansion of some of our brands, production capacity, and consumer engagement. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 43.1%, compared to 21.3% last year. The increase in rate was primarily due to the expected further reduction in earnings, related to our travel retail business for fiscal 2023. Diluted EPS of $0.47 decreased 75% compared to last year. This was at the high-end of our outlook, despite the significantly higher-than-normal tax rate. The impact from foreign currency translation and foreign currency transactions in key travel retail locations negatively impacted diluted EPS by 1%, and 3% respectively. For the nine months, we generated $1 billion in net cash flows from operating activity, compared to $2 billion last year. The decline from last year reflects lower net income, partially offset by lower working capital. We invested $652 million in capital expenditures, and we returned $945 million in cash to stockholders through both dividends and share repurchases. On April 28, we were pleased to complete the acquisition of the TOM FORD brand. The amounts paid at closing of approximately $2.25 billion were funded through a combination of cash, including the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper, and $250 million received from one of the licensees of the brand, Marcolin. An additional aggregate amount of $300 million in deferred payments and 5% interest per annum to the sellers become due from the company, beginning in July, 2025. We estimate an EPS dilution to the full-year of approximately $0.03 to $0.04. And now turning to our outlook for fiscal 2023, clearly this fiscal year has proven to be a perfect storm of higher-than-anticipated volatility, from both global, external headwinds and uncertainties surrounding the timing and pace of recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily in China and Asia travel retail. In August, we expected a gradual improvement throughout the first-half of the fiscal year, as markets in international travel began to recover from the impacts of COVID restrictions. However, the actual impacts to our business in Asia travel retail and China to a lesser extent have been far greater than we anticipated, given the prolonged challenges from the pandemic, including a slower-than-expected recovery of traffic and sales conversion in prestige beauty in these markets. Further compounding this pressure is the tightening of inventory by retailers in Hainan. We now expect that a far more gradual return to normal sales growth in Asia travel retail is likely to persist into the first-half of fiscal 2024. In addition, higher inflation and currency volatility as well as promotions in certain markets to alleviate high stock levels more than offset our price increases, and further pressured our business margins. In sight of the volatility in Asia travel retail that delayed the recovery relative to what we had expected, as well as the macro pressures from inflation and currency, we have been encouraged by the faster-than-anticipated improvements across many of our markets globally, as they progress through various stages of recovery from the pandemic. While we are lowering our full-year outlook to reflect continued decline in net sales in Asia travel retail, including the tightening of inventory by certain retailers, we plan to invest in markets where traffic and consumption are returning, and expect to return to overall net sales growth in the fourth quarter. This reflects double-digit sales growth in the Asia-Pacific region, including Mainland China, as well as in EMEA, excluding Asia travel retail. The Americas has planned to grow single-digits. Currency also continues to pressure margins relative to prior year. As Fabrizio mentioned, we are certainly not satisfied with our results this fiscal year, and will address plans to progressively rebuild the margin accretive areas of our business beyond this fiscal year from the current year's level. When full recovery does occur from the pandemic, we do expect the return to healthy growth of our Asia travel retail business, and in our related skincare category supported by a more normalized level of investment in selling, advertising and promotional activities, reflective of the increased brick-and-mortar traffic. With these assumptions as our backdrop and using March 31st spot rate of 1.09 for the euro, 1.239 for the pound, 6.872 for the yuan, and 12.97 for the Korean won, we now forecast organic net sales for the full-year to decline 75%. Currency translation is expected to dilute reported sales growth for the full fiscal year by 4 percentage points. And we anticipate an additional 1 point of dilution from the impact of certain foreign currency transactions and key international travel retail locations. The impact of sales from certain designer license access is expected to dilute reported growth by approximately 1 point. Full-year operating margin is forecasted to be approximately 11.1%. An 860 basis point contraction from the prior year period, primarily due to the disruptions from COVID restrictions that not only impacted sales in Asia travel retail and Mainland China but also resulted in increased obsolescence charges, discounts and promotional expenses. Foreign currency impact and the strategic investments, I mentioned previously. are also expected to pressure margin. We now expect our full-year effective tax rate to be approximately 27%, reflecting the change in our estimated geographical mix of earnings for the balance of the year. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $3.29 and $3.39 before restructuring and other charges. And, includes the expected impact of the Tom Ford acquisition I mentioned previously. This includes approximately $0.26 of dilution from currency translation. In constant currency, we expect EPS to decline approximately 51% which includes a negative impact from foreign currency transactions in key international travel retail location of approximately four percentage points. While this has been a challenging and disappointing year, navigating through many uncertainties the strength we are seeing in many of our recovery market gives us tremendous optimism for the future. Our long-term fundamentals and strategy remain intact as does our confidence in the long-term growth opportunity for global prestige beauty in our brands with the investments we have made to sustain long-term profitable growth. On behalf of Fabrizio and the Este\u0301e Lauder company's leadership team, we want to extend our immense gratitude to all of our employees around the world. We recognize that this has been an incredibly challenging year for you. And we want to thank you for your extraordinary efforts through dedication and commitment to the company and your resilience as we continue together on our path to recovery. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We will be happy to take your questions at this time. Okay, Dara, so thank you for the question. In Hainan, as we said in the prepared remarks, we are starting to see during the quarter passenger traffic comeback in Hainan, and that's been very positive. As Fabrizio mentioned in his prepared remarks, we had a group that was in Hainan a few weeks back and saw quite a bit of activity. So, we are very encouraged, and in fact, Hainan actually reflected the positive retail sales in the third quarter. So, this is the first quarter, the Hainan performance for us has been up and down all year. And some of the swings have been quite severe, but we did see a progression to positive retail sales. I think the thing that gives us more comfort now on a more continuous steady progression of recovery is the fact that the COVID restrictions have been lifted. And so, what we were experiencing before with our travel retail business is the volatility related to some of the COVID restrictions and the flow of traffic and travel, and people's comfort with travel. So, that gives us more comfort that we are going to see a recovery. In terms of our experience as it relates to the business and why it has been as significant as it is because when you look back at the beginning of this year, we had very strong momentum coming into the year in travel retail, in Hainan in particular, our July results were up strong double-digit. Then, Hainan went into closure. And that extended for longer than we had anticipated, but given the results we have seen in July and actually in some previous months, we had expected that that recovery would happen faster once the lockdown was lifted, and that didn't happen. And our retailers also expected that recovery. We ended up with more inventory in the trade than what was needed basically for the level of sales that were being done in Hainan. So, our pullback in inventory right now given the pace of recovery that we are seeing, again we encouraged, but the retail inventory needs to come down. And therefore, we are pulling back on our shipments. Korea, we talked about in the last call in terms of what happened in Korea. We basically have a change in the rollback of COVID-19 related supportive measures with Korean duty free operators, and that too was pretty sudden in the third quarter. The expectation is that we will see travelers come back to Korea and come back to duty-free shopping in Korea, but that has not happened yet. Korea benefits from having a lot of organized tour business from Chinese traveling consumers, and that has been slower to come back. So, that certainly is pressuring our fourth quarter as well. And again, it has been difficult to predict the timing of all of this recovery, but we do know the recovery is happening. So, we don't believe there is an issue at all with prestige beauty. When we are look at the recovery we are seeing in the Americas, in other Asia-Pac region, in EMEA, we see very strong recovery of prestige beauty, and actually you are seeing an acceleration of fragrance, makeup, and skincare. So, it really is based on what we are seeing in other regions given they are further along in the recovery relative to some of the regions that you asked about. So, as Fabrizio said, we have made some structural changes to the business that going forward should allow us to manage volatility. Hopefully we will see the level of volatility that we have seen certainly over the past year, but we will have more agility in our operations. To your question on the fourth quarter and what's in our implied guidance, as it relates to travel retail, coming off of the trends that we are seeing in March, the progress of trends that we're seeing through the third quarter, we are expecting that our retail sales and travel retail will be up double-digits, and our net sales are down double-digits, more than our retails are up. So, again, this is another quarter of trying to -- we have little down the inventory that's in the trade, hence the impact that you see in the fourth quarter, and as Fabrizio said, much of that being our very strong skincare business. So, we do expect, as I said in my prepared remarks that some of this will bleed into the first quarter, and perhaps a little bit into the second quarter, but get progressively better. And so, we get to the inventory levels that both we and our customers want in the trade. We are working with and partnering with our customers on their programs, also now that traffic increase back in airports, we are investing in advertising in airports, we are employing some of the sales staffs that was not there when the airports were empty, and we are working with our brands on great programs and promotions for customers as they return to airports. So, our travel retail team has been quite busy working with our retailers to recapture the growth that we are now seeing, in particular, in Hainan and hopefully soon in Korea as well. So, thank you for the question. I said in the prepared remarks, we expect off of this year, which obviously has been a big setback year for the reasons that we've spoken about, out highest margin category and a very high margin channel being pressured. We do expect a progressive recovery in margin, but that does mean not back to 19% in fiscal '24. And so, we are taking cost actions as we always do. We certainly have cost control measures in place as it relates to areas like headcount, consulting expenses, other expenses as well. And we are in the process now finalizing our budgets for fiscal '24, and certainly will have better information for you in terms of what that margin progression looks like for fiscal '24 in our August call. But it certainly will be more than 50 basis points of margin expansion off of its level, but certainly not to the 19% level. Yes. I mean in the prepared remarks, Oliver, we talked about areas that we are gaining share, and so, I think we are seeing strong momentum in some of the recovery markets that are gaining share, inclusive of China, and China is a real indicator for what we can expect when some of the areas that have been suppressed this year, like travel retail Hainan and in Korea when Chinese traveling consumers returned to Korea. So, I think those things are quite positive. We have strong innovation programs as well to support our growth for certainly next year as well. And the fact again, the biggest volatility that we've seen this year has been in some of the COVID restrictions in certain markets that had been lifted. And so, now it's a matter of the timing in case of that recovery. We see a little bit better, but I'm a bit cautious obviously given what we have experienced this year, but recognizing that trigger is one that really has created as much volatility for the reasons that we have already spoken about. We are feeling a bit better. There will be still volatility certainly in the fourth quarter, and there will be volatility next year, but we have always been a company that's been relatively good at managing volatility, this year, given the severity of it, and the severity in the channel of operation that it happened has caused us to have these results, but rest assured, myself, Fabrizio and the entire management team are diligently working on recovering our profitability, and certainly recovering growth, and our brands continue to be very strong with consumers. So, Lauren, let me take that last one. Yes, we do expect that our sales will be down again in the first quarter, and pick up in the second quarter. And so, that's the cadence that we are seeing right now. Again, it much depends on retail sales, and again, as we said, we are encouraged by how retails sales have picked up in Hainan, not as much in Korea at the moment, but we remain encouraged that will happen as well. So, the pace of retail, which has been slower, again than we expected this year, will determine how quickly we resume shipments. We do have some very exacting new products that we do hope that we can actually ship them in the first and second quarter, but again, with the activities that we have going on with our travel retail partners I believe that we will see a continued acceleration of retail like we started to see in this quarter."

[Operator Instructions] And now I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio.\nFabrizio Freda : Thank you, Rainey, and hello to everyone. It is good to be with you today. Turning to results. For the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, organic sales fell 11% and which was within our outlook despite the incremental pressure of COVID-19 resurgence in China.  Many developed and emerging markets globally outperformed our expectations to offset the COVID-related impacts of significantly reduced retail traffic as well as limited staffing in beauty adviser, in domestic China and Travel Retail in Hainan in November and December. Adjusted EPS fell 45%. While its deep decline, this was meaningfully better than our outlook, driven by both disciplined expense management and moderation of the stronger U.S. dollars.  Importantly, we continue to prudently invest for growth, launching thought after innovation and increasing A&P as a percentage of sales. For fiscal year 2023, we are lowering our outlook for organic sales growth and adjusted diluted EPS primarily for 2 reasons. First, inventory levels in Hainan remains somewhat more elevated than we expected due to the disruptions in travel and in-store staffing levels in November and December. Second, the recently announced potential rollback of COVID related supportive measures in Korea Duty Free are creating a near-term transitory pressure to our business with our courier duty-free retailers.  In the third quarter, it is more than offsetting the initial positive impact from the resumption of international travel by Chinese consumers as well as favorable trends in our second quarter, including outstanding performance across many developed markets in Western Europe and Asia Pacific as well as many emerging markets globally and a better-than-expected currency environment. All told, our return to growth has shifted from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, which Tracey will discuss in greater detail. We remain focused on investing in our brands including for innovation, advertising, strategic entry into new countries and expanded consumer reach to fuel our multiple engines of growth strategy. Our growth engines in the second quarter were many among categories, regions and channels, and we anticipate the gradual return of more growth engines across the second half of fiscal year 2023. Beginning with categories. Fragrance extended its long-running double-digit organic sales growth streak in the second quarter, rising 12%. We are inspired by the growth prospects still ahead for the luxury and artisanal segment of the category. As consumer [indiscernible] unique distinct and long lasting sense of the highest quality. Many of today, consumers seek to build an occasion-based collection to express on sell differently across seasons, time of the day or events. Our portfolios of Jo Malone London, Tom Ford Beauty, Le Labo, KILIAN PARIS, Editions de Parfums Frederic Malle is ideally positioned for this accelerating fundamental shift. As demand increases globally, we are excited about our plans to bring these brands to new markets and channels in the coming quarters. Innovation will also continue to be a key growth pillar. For example, Tom Ford Beauty outstanding loans or [indiscernible] in the first half will be followed by the cherry collection in the second half, building on the success of regional hero last cherry. Makeup grew organically in the Americas as well as the domestic markets EMEA in across southeast Asia in the second quarter. Our brands are indeed realized in the promise of the category [indiscernible] as professional and personal use education feed on point innovation, alluring marketing campaigns on new platforms and I think artist. MAC was a standout success. The brand growth engines were many, freestanding doors excelled, welcoming consumers with expert services delivering double-digit organic sales growth globally. Across channels, blockbuster innovation, hero products and holiday merchandise proved highly sort. Clinic further fueled makeup across subcategories led by list as the brand has created a hero franchise with [indiscernible] almost lipstick in black honey. Estee Lauder Double Wear foundation had exceptional success with Its My Shade, My Story campaign in Western Europe. Virality on TikTok drove strong new consumer acquisition and the franchise strengthened its #1 ranking foundation with prestige beauty share gains.  Looking ahead, we are excited for the launch of Estee Lauder Pure Color lipstick in the second half. The brand reinvented its iconic franchise to capitalize on lipstick revival and integrate skin care benefits for lips. -- designed to flatter all skin tones across mat, cream and luster finishes the line packaging peso edge to the brand original lipstick from the 1960s. In hair care, our brands extended the category organic sales growth streak to 8 consecutive quarters. for the second half, did launch last July in Mainland China will be complemented by the brand recent entry into Travel Retail in Haina. -- as we continue investing for the vibrant growth opportunity of prestige hair care with the Chinese consumers. Moreover, Avida became a certified B Corporation, joining Le Labo in our portfolio in achieving these important third-party validation as the brand deepened its decades-long commitment to social and environmental responsibility. Skin Care organic sales fell sharply in the second quarter.  There were a few headwinds with the biggest challenge being COVID-19 in travel retail in Asia and with the Chinese consumer, given the category's exposure. Amin, the top landscape for skin care, the ordinary was a striking success. Its organic sales growth accelerated from high single digit in the first quarter to strong double digits in the second quarter. The brand's hero product excelled as did the blockbuster innovation of multiple tail lash and brow serum, while the ordinary also realized outstanding performance in the specialty multichannel again, momentum for its exciting launch in India in the fourth quarter of last year. We are focused on returning skin care to growth globally with sequentially improving trends from the third quarter to the fourth quarter as a transitory pressure from travel retail abate. To that end, we have an incredibly rich innovation pipeline primed to launch. Here a few among them. Already out from MAC is its new hyper-real franchise as the brand leverage its expertise to create an artist approved skin care line of products which are purposely designed to perform also with makeup. La Air revamped motorizing soft cream arrived this month with powerful new clinical results to reverse and receive visible signs of aging. Thereafter, Clinique will bring most Sud SPS to market. extend its popular hero product to meet consumer desire for hydration and some protection with a lightweight texture that has made MotorSerge100 age and Icon. With these launches, we aim to reach new consumers demographic tapped into high-growth subsegment.  Let me now turn to geographies. While the U.S. and domestic China were challenged in the second quarter with sales falling single digit organically in each market, we believe both will be growth engines in the second half. For the U.S., we are optimistic for a return to growth given sequentially improving monthly trend in each of organic sales and retail sales performance throughout the second quarter.  Building on this momentum, the market is equipped with numerous growth drivers, including an exceptional innovation pipeline across brands roll out of new Clinique counters to select doors after a successful pilot of Clinique lab in [indiscernible] and launch of exclusive products by many brands in specialty-multi. We are also progressively modernizing numerous freestanding store as they are primed to be an important contributor to growth following rationalization of the footprint.  Moreover, our enhanced omnichannel capabilities are also primed to contribute to growth in the U.S. as consumers who engage with our brands online and in store drive consistently higher value from upsell and cross-sell. This was especially true during holidays in the second quarter. For domestic China, we are confident in a vibrant recovery for our business following the relaxing of cove restriction. -- as the economy is well positioned to rebound and Chinese consumers are passion for prestige beauty.  We entered this phase with momentum having expanded our market share of prestige but in China during the second quarter, driven by gains on all of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care demonstrating that this ability of our aspirational brand portfolio and the excellent go-to-market strategies of our local team. While the third quarter is set to be more variable, because of the high level of covet cases, we now anticipate even stronger organic sales growth as of the fourth quarter as recovery evolves. We expect online to continue its strengths and anticipate a gradual return to more fulsome brick-and-mortar traffic by the end of the fiscal year. Online organic sales rose single digit in the second quarter, fueled by many brands led by La Mer double-digit growth. We achieved excellent results for 11 as the Estee Lauder brand realized top ranks across platforms. Moreover, our retail sales growth in online channel meaningfully outpaced the industry in the quarter for strong prestige beauty share gains. Beyond the U.S. and China, we realized outstanding organic sales growth in many large developed and emerging markets around the world. Our local team has been executing with excellence to deliver broad-based sales gains. Western Europe, led by the U.K. prospered, while Japan and Australia contributed strongly in Asia Pacific. India, Brazil, Turkey and Malaysia are among the stars of our emerging markets with each posting strong double-digit organic sales growth led by India, rising nearly 50%. We are very encouraged with the excellent performance we are delivering in emerging markets. As these emerging markets evolve in recovery from the pandemic, we foresee compelling long-term growth opportunity arising from the expanding middle class trading up into prestige beauty.  We entered this important phase of recovery from a position of strength as we hold leading prestige beauty share in many of these markets. For example, in India, Mexico, South Africa, we are the #1 rent company in both prestige makeup and skincare, while we lead in prestige makeup in Malaysia, Thailand and Turkey. Let me now turn to the strategic deal we announced in November to acquire Tom 4. This transformational luxury acquisition will make Tumor an own brand of stellate companies. enabling us to manage the brand's intellectual property and equity. Staying true to our focus as a pure play in prestige beauty. We have also reached agreements with luxury companies, ZenyaGroup and Marcolin to license the brand fashion and eyewear businesses, respectively. We first partnered with Tom Ford over 15 years ago, and a singular vision of model luxury is beyond compare. Together, we have elevated to for beauty into the top echelon of high-growth luxury beauty impressively. TolfBeauty is expected to achieve $1 billion in net sales annually over the next couple of years, and we are promising profitable growth opportunities ahead.  Before I close, I want to recognize the start of black Easter month in the U.S. and thank our employees to have created an engaging calendar of events for colleagues and consumers to celebrate and honor the black experience. while we continue to focus on accelerating our commitment to raise our equity and the collective accomplishment of our equity goals year-round. In closing, while we are lowering our fiscal year 2023 outlook to reflect the additional transitory pressures affecting our Travel Retail business, -- we are encouraged by both the strong underlying trends in many other areas of our business and improving macro trends. Inflation has stabilized in many markets globally the strength of the U.S. dollar has moderated. And the return to mobility domestically and international travel is happening earlier than expected. Moreover, in the first half of fiscal year 2023, we made exciting progress on several strategic initiatives to drive growth and resiliency in our business. We significantly strengthened our capabilities in innovation, manufacturing and distribution have opened the China innovation labs our first plant in Asia Pacific, our new DC in China, while we also announced our brand portfolio with Tom Ford and Balmain Beauty. All told, we have great confidence that we will emerge from this volatile transitional year, even better positioned to realize the long-term growth opportunity of global prestige beauty to our employees, our future is bright because of your creativity, passion and wisdom. I extend my deepest gratitude for your significant contribution to our long-term success.  And now I turn the call over to Tracey.\nTracey Travis: Thank you, Fabrizio, and hello, everyone. As Fabrizio mentioned, our business in the second quarter continued to be pressured by the external headwinds of COVID-related impacts, including the rising number of COVID cases in China, lower shipments of replenishment orders in the U.S. and the stronger U.S. dollar. Our second quarter organic net sales declined 11% and earnings per share decreased 49% to $1.54.  We tighter expense management and a slightly improved currency impact contributed to our better-than-expected EPS results. From a geographic standpoint, organic net sales in the Americas declined 3%. The -- we saw healthy demand for our holiday offerings as consumers gravitated to our in-store and online promotions. However, we also experienced lower shipments of replenishment orders due to both retailer inventory tightening as we anticipated, and a later improvement in retail trends post-Christmas. In Latin America, organic net sales rose double digits, reflecting continued growth in nearly all markets, the evolution of recovery and makeup as consumers return to stores, and the strength of our fragrance portfolio. Organic net sales in our Europe, the Middle East and Africa region declined 17%, including the negative impact from foreign currency transactions and key international travel retail locations of 3%. The decline was driven by travel retail as expected, while growth from nearly every market in the rest of the region was strong. Our global travel retail sales were significantly pressured by the ongoing COVID-related impacts. Despite stores being opened throughout the quarter, travel to Hainan remain largely curtailed, and as a result, shipments of replenishment inventory remained low. Elsewhere, we experienced strong sales growth in Travel Retail, reflecting increased international tourism as travel restrictions in many countries lifted from the prior year. The ongoing pressures in Asia travel retail more than offset the growth we experienced in the rest of the EMEA region, including both developed and emerging markets such as the United Kingdom, France, India and Turkey. We continue to see various stages of recovery across the region that coupled with the strong resumption of tourism fueled brick-and-mortar growth during the quarter. Organic net sales in our Asia Pacific region fell 7%, primarily due to the ongoing COVID-related impacts in Greater China. This affected brick-and-mortar sales in Greater China and Dr. Jart Travel Retail in Korea. Online sales continued to grow in Mainland China due in part to the expansion of our online presence with the recent launches on JD and Joyn as well as solid performance during the 11.11 Shopping Festival. Most of the other markets in the region continued to progress in recovery as the return of brick-and-mortar traffic led to high single-digit or double-digit growth in Japan, Australia, Malaysia and the Philippines. From a category standpoint, fragrance continued to lead growth with organic net sales rising 12%. Strong holiday demand for our beautiful line of fragrances from Estee Lauder and double-digit growth from both La La bond Tom Ford Beauty propelled the category's growth in every region during the quarter. Organic net sales in hair care rose 4% and declined 3% in makeup, the latter driven primarily by the COVID restrictions in China as solid performance from both MAC and Clinique drove growth in both the Americas and in domestic markets in EMEA.  Organic net sales in skin care declined 20%. This category continues to be the most affected by the COVID restrictions in China, particularly in Asia travel retail and Mainland China, where skin care accounts for a large majority of our business. Our gross margin declined 430 basis points compared to last year. The positive impacts from strategic pricing in this quarter were more than offset by inflationary pressures in our supply chain, region and category mix, and higher costs due to promotional items. Operating expenses increased 500 basis points as a percent of sales, driven primarily by the reduction in sales. This also reflects our investments in areas such as advertising, promotional activities and innovation, which increased 150 basis points compared to last year. Operating income declined 46% to $768 million, and our operating margin contracted 930 basis points to 16.6% in the quarter.  During the quarter, we recorded $207 million of impairment charges related to the 3 brands, primarily reflecting lower-than-expected growth in key geographic regions and channels given the pressure on consumer demand from the impacts of COVID. Diluted EPS of $1.54 decreased 49% compared to last year. The impact from foreign currency translation and foreign currency transactions in key travel retail locations negatively impacted diluted EPS and by 5% and 4%, respectively. During the quarter, we generated $751 million in net cash flows from operating activities compared to $1.8 billion last year. The decline from last year reflects lower net income and the negative impact from changes in working capital, primarily due to the timing of payments. We invested $419 million in capital expenditures, and we returned $708 million in cash to stockholders through both dividends and share repurchases. As we expected, our first half performance was pressured by ongoing external headwinds. Let me now turn to our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2023. For the second half of fiscal 2023, we are encouraged by the easing of COVID restrictions in China and the expected return of travelers throughout Asia and around the world once more stabilization occurs with outbound flights and visas as well as cover entry and testing requirements. In Hainan, we are starting to see increased positive signs already. as traffic level declines have moderated in recent months. However, retailer inventory levels are still somewhat elevated, reflecting the impact of the lengthy store closures as well as the rapid reduction in traffic and in-store staffing levels in November and December. And in Korea travel retail, an incremental headwind has emerged since the last outlook we provided in November. The recently announced potential rollback of COVID-related supportive measures in Korea Duty Free is creating a near-term transitory pressure to our business with our Korean duty-free retailers, which is pressuring our third quarter outlook. We now also expect more moderate net sales growth near term in our China business as the rise of Cove cases in November and December slowed expected brick-and-mortar retail traffic and social usage occasions. -- which continued in January during the pre-Lunar New Year shopping time frame. Collectively, we expect these impacts to create greater headwinds in the third quarter than we originally anticipated.  As a result, we are updating our outlook to reflect a shift in the start of the travel retail recovery in Asia from the third to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 due to the normalization of inventory levels in Hainan, the uncertain pace of recovery of travel retail traffic in Korea and a more moderate acceleration of growth in China. The momentum from our other developed and emerging markets in EMEA and Asia Pacific in the first half is expected to continue as those markets progressively evolve in recovery. We are also cautiously optimistic and expect our North America net sales performance to improve as our retail growth trend in the region has already increased, particularly in January. -- and we have a supportive innovation pipeline planned for the second half, as Fabrizio mentioned. As it relates to our operating income, while these external headwinds have introduced a high level of volatility and that has had a meaningful impact on our financial results this fiscal year. We remain confident in the ongoing strength of prestige beauty, our business strategy and our ability to reaccelerate long-term profitable growth. We, therefore, plan to sustain the strategic investments imperative to that growth, including innovation, advertising and continued geographic expansion for many of our brands. These investments also support the continued strengthening of our multiple engines of growth as we invest in emerging markets and faster growth channels that are already progressing well in their recovery. As a result, we expect to see pressure on our operating income in the third quarter with an accelerated improvement in the fourth quarter as the sales recovery in travel retail, Mainland China, and skin care start to materialize more meaningfully. The negative impacts from foreign currency that we anticipated in our previous guidance have improved due to the recent weakening of the U.S. dollar. However, currency is still expected to be a meaningful drag our reported sales and diluted EPS growth for the third quarter and full year. Our outlook is now based on December 30 spot rates of 1.067 for the euro, 1.207 for the pound, 6.964 for the Chinese yuan and 12.63 for the Korean yuan. So with that backdrop, our guidance is as follows: we expect organic sales for our third quarter to decline 10% to 8%, primarily reflecting the pressures to our Travel Retail business that I mentioned previously. Currency translation is expected to be dilutive to reported net sales by 3 points and the impact of certain foreign currency transactions in key international travel locations is not expected to be material. The impact of sales from certain designer fragrance license exits are expected to dilute reported growth by approximately 1 point. We expect third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.37 to $0.47 for a decline between 81% to 75%. Currency translation is expected to be dilutive to EPS by $0.04, such that constant currency adjusted EPS is expected to decline between 79% to 73%. This includes the negative impact from certain foreign currency transactions and key international travel retail locations of approximately 1 percentage point.  For the full year, SP27916451 assuming a reacceleration of Travel Retail [indiscernible] in the full range between down 2% to flat. Currency translation is expected to dilute reported sales growth for the full fiscal year by 4 percentage points and we expect an additional 1 point of dilution from the impact of certain foreign currency transactions in key international travel retail locations. The impact of sales from certain designer license exits are expected to dilute reported growth by approximately 1 point. We expect full year operating margin to be approximately 15.1%, a 460 basis point contraction from the prior year period primarily due to the geographical and category mix of sales and foreign currency impacts as well as the sustained investments to support recovery as previously mentioned. We now expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 25.5%, reflecting in part the change in our estimated geographical mix of earnings. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $4.87 and 502 before restructuring and other charges. This includes approximately $0.29 of dilution from currency translation. In constant currency, we expect EPS to fall between 29% and 27%, which includes a negative impact from foreign currency transactions and key international travel retail locations, of approximately 4 percentage points. Regarding the Tom Ford brand acquisition, we expect to complete this transaction in the fourth quarter and to fund it through a combination of cash, debt and deferred payments. In anticipation of closing this transaction, in January, we increased our commercial paper program by $2 billion. We also estimate a slight EPS dilution to the full year outlook that I just provided due to the final purchase accounting inclusive of transaction costs. While this year has undoubtedly been a perfect storm of unforeseen macro pressures on our business, and the transition to accelerated recovery has indeed been longer than we anticipated, we have navigated through the challenging environment and strengthened the company in the process, thanks to our amazing employees, our company values and our multiple engines of growth strategy.  We are encouraged by the many signs of improvement in the overall environment and the progress our incredible teams have made in preparing us for a strong recovery. Our fundamentals are solid and intact, reinforced by the actions we have taken over the past few years. From the acquisition of the majority interest in [indiscernible] in fiscal 2021 to the recent announcement of our agreement to acquire the Tom Ford brand and the Balmain license agreement.  We are expanding our brand portfolio at both the entry and luxury levels of prestige beauty. We've taken strategic actions to enhance our go-to-market capabilities, supply chain agility and local relevance through our new innovation, production and distribution facilities in Asia. We've enhanced our digital marketing capabilities and continue to progress on our ESG initiatives. These actions and many more demonstrate that we remain confident in the long-term sustainable profitable growth of our business. And that concludes our prepared remarks.  We'll be happy to take your questions at this time.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays.\nLauren Lieberman: I was hoping -- and this is probably more for you, Tracey. If you could walk through with us how you're I guess, the length of the supply chain works for supplying both Hainan and Mainland China currently, knowing it's shifting. Because as we think through the change forecast in demand and knowing what I believe is a pretty lengthy supply chain, how you're managing production versus shipments and if that's sort of informing why there's so much visibility seemingly on 4Q. And I guess we should see inventory spike up on your balance sheet in 3Q. Is that right?\nTracey Travis : Yes. You're correct, Lauren, that we do expect that we will -- two things. One, inventory levels are still coming down in Hainan. They are almost at the level that we would expect sales to accelerate. So yes, you should start to see an inventory build related to the shipments that we expect to see in Q4. In Korea, again, the pace is a little bit more uncertain given the transitory nature of what's going on right now. So we do anticipate, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks that we will start to see resumption of travel in Korea. And depending on the pace of that resumption that will depend on the amount of shipments that we have in the quarter. But we have taken obviously an assumption there. We are sitting on a decent amount of inventory even in our own warehouses to supply the sales that we expect to see in the fourth quarter.\nOperator: The next question is from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: So just sort of extend that question a little bit, right? We have a lot of quarterly volatility in terms of Q3 versus Q4. Q2, there's a difference in shipments versus underlying retail sales. Obviously, COVID impacts in China. So it's hard to get a great underlying sense of retail sales here and how the business is doing. So a ratio, maybe you can just give us a little bit of an update on retail sales by region I'm particularly interested in category growth and any macro impacts in the U.S. and Europe? And then how you're thinking about Asia Pac and China versus the rest of the region. Let's so -- on near-term results here, but more how results came into the quarter versus what you originally expected and that might inform the revenue trajectory as you look out over the next couple of years and how you think about it? I think you touched on a lot of aspects of that, but it would be helpful to get a general overview.\nFabrizio Freda: Yes. No. Absolutely, with pleasure. Let me start with China, first of all. And so China, the results in the quarter where pretty good. We built significant market share. So the overall market in China was negative double digit. Our net sales were and our retail was negative single digits, and we built market share in every single category. So in most arises, we build market share in makeup in fragrance, in health care in every aspect.  Now this, for us, is a very important sign that the -- our brands are really working the aspirational value of our brands remains very, very strong, which in the moment of reopening is a very strong position to be. So excellent performance relatively to market. Though some of our brands were shining, La Mer in skin care was the brand that was gaining the best market share on for beauty in makeup and Jo Malone London in fragrance was really leading the share gain. The other important reading of China is that during 11/11, our net sales were up 10.9%, and our retail sales were up 11.9% and holding the #1 ranking across various categories. and there was a lot of great success on the brand creative activity in live streaming on innovation. And so the way when the consumers are back in this very difficult volatile period like a situation like 11.11, where there is obviously high traffic our brands respond enormously. And obviously, when the consumers are not back or don't travel or our site is when, obviously, we have seen some issues. So in total, China is developing the way we planned. And from a market share standpoint, recovering also and is definitely going in the right direction. In terms of the future, the potential of China, we continue to see now the opening to create a gain traffic in Mainland, in brick-and-mortar, we see the continuation of the line success. And we see the -- obviously, the reopening of Hainan. And so the Chinese consumer on all fronts. Also, we see the fact that the Chinese consumer is starting to travel internationally. [indiscernible] and this will gradually increase as the governments will agree theses and models of growth. In this moment, there are parts of the world we already opened, others we will open soon Japan, we understand it's been an agreement, but it's not yet open, we'll be in soon. Korea is the 1 where the agreement is not yet finalized, but we are optimistic that in the future, this also would be resolved. So that's another very important trend. This will have a positive impact, obviously, in our retail channel, but also in the countries of destination, like it's always been historically happened. In terms of categories in China, obviously, the most important thing that will happen as the China accelerate on all fronts will be the skin care will accelerate for us. And so the acceleration of Travel Retail Asia, the Aleris China, the acceleration of international travel of Chinese, which we had in front of us in part in quarter 4, but in part in -- fiscal year 2024. This will will generate a substantial improvement of our skin care trends that, in turn, will have a positive impact on our margin mix. So that's obviously an important element of the program.  Then other regions of the world. As I commented in my prepared remarks, has been very strong in Europe where we built market share. in most of the European markets. Very strong in the rest of Asia, particularly strong gains in Japan and Australia, as I commented already. And in Korea, excluding the travel retail impacts, that are particularly heavy on our Dejar brand, which has a big percentage in Travel Retail, excluding that also Korea started progressing very well. So good progress in all the other regions. Then North America. Now in North America, obviously, we also continue to lose share in the quarter. And overall, we would like to accelerate our plan of share recovery. But the good news is there's been very strong progress in quarter 2. Every single month, October, November and then December, there was progress in top line sales acceleration. First of all, in retail, the quarter in the U.S. ended plus 2%, so on the positive. But December was plus 6.5%, 7%. So in line with our goals of acceleration. So we see the U.S. progressing. Now the next 6 months, there is an even stronger plan. In the U.S., we have a strong acceleration of innovation. I mentioned already some in the in the prepared remarks like Estee Lauder Pachorolistic, Moreso Sudo Clinique, Hyperion Marc, soft cream on La Mer, cherry collection to Ford. So -- and then we have some important distribution improvement. We are deploying more distribution in department store of our high-end fragrances in Macy's in dealers the ordinary is entering some doors and strands.  We are deploying in Ulta and in Sephora new, incremental [indiscernible] and incremental expansion of our key brands in these doors. And we are renovating 100 free stand store opening 8 new freshen stores and continue to improve our omnichannel capabilities on all fronts. So we see an acceleration of our progress also in the U.S. So in summary, when I should add what Tracey also underline that at the same time, we have improved our capability behind this program. Our digital marketing is strong. Our supply chain is shortened and faster. Obviously, we have done progress in our factory in Japan, our R&D has opened our R&D center in China that will increase the amount of local relevant innovations in Asia in an important way in the next fiscal year -- starting this fiscal year in a significant way. And we have opened a new distribution on the serves travel retail in Switzerland and on the service, obviously, China, within China, as we discussed also in the last call. So there are all these investments and progresses in capabilities that make us ready the reacceleration in the future. And so this fiscal year, in summary, has been a year where, really, we suffered about the COVID lockdowns, particularly in Asia. And then the high level of infections during the reopening and the impact of the strength of the U.S. dollar that was particularly big in our high profit, high important channels like travel retail, like China, travel retails because on core and China, the dollar was particularly impactful. So it was really a perfect storm kind of situation. But all the rest, apart from these 3 areas really progressed and in some cases, very successful in market share gaining. So that's my overview. I hope to answer your question that having an overview of the situation. but I would say is very, very encouraging for the recovery period.\nOperator: The next question is from Peter Grom of UBS.\nPeter Grom: So Tracey, I wanted to ask about the implied outlook for organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter, which is quite strong and better than expected. And I know we're still a few months away from fiscal '24 here. But is the implied exit rate in the 4Q guidance a fair way to kind of think about the potential top line recovery looking out to next year? Or are there kind of the timing-related impact given what you're forecasting in 3Q that could be driving them a stronger growth So look, we are expecting a stronger fourth quarter than probably you anticipated and us as well, given a few months back. And part of that, as we said in our prepared remarks, is because of the shift of recovery expectation, certainly in terms of some of Travel Retail, I would just remind you that -- and I know you're well aware of this, we're also anniversarying last year's some pretty significant shutdowns. So this volatility that we're speaking about actually started at the end of our fiscal 2022 in the fourth quarter. And we're coming up on the anniversary of that. So the numbers look particularly large from a from a growth standpoint because we are anniversarying some lockdowns in China and in travel retail in Hainan in particular, which was the start of some of the problems that we have anticipated on this call today. I think we are anticipating for fiscal '24, we're not giving fiscal '24 guidance right now. But given that in the fourth quarter, all markets are anticipated to be open and remain open and traveling will gradually resume and again, uncertain about the pace of that resumption, but we've certainly seen encouraging signs in many of our markets. that fiscal '24 will be a strong year for us. So I wouldn't take the the Q4 implied growth and apply it to fiscal '24. Peter, if that's what you're getting at. But certainly, we expect that we -- many of -- there will still be volatility in fiscal '24, but the volatility related to the pandemic and some of the things that we've experienced this year should be much moderate than certainly what we've experienced this year. And if you have any predictions on currency, certainly do let me know.\nOperator: The next question is from Michael Binetti of Credit Suisse.\nMichael Binetti: Tracey, maybe I could just dovetail on that a little bit. you told us a few quarters back that 20% margin was a North Star. As you think out to next year and many of the moving parts of your business finally start to come back online? Is that -- is there any -- I don't know there may be some pull-forward revenue that leaks into the first half of the year. I don't know, obviously, you gave us the fourth quarter here. But as you look out to next year, is 20% in appropriate North Star for next year given the revenue drivers back online? And then I guess, Fabrizio, can you help us size the travel business a little better since it's such a big swing factor in the model here going forward. I think it was about 15% of sales pre-COVID, half of it China. You spoke a little bit about the shape of it at a conference in December that the pre-COVID that Chinese business -- the Chinese traveler was largely a Tier 1 international traveler. I think you said Hainan only has completely replaced that, but it's a different customer, maybe a lower-tier customer. just because this moves the model around so much, can you help us just think about how big that business is today in the non-China markets, Hainan -- non-Hainan China to help us think about the model.\nTracey Travis : So let me just -- and Fabrizio will pick up on your questions on Travel Retail. But Travel Retail actually was larger. You're remembering, Michael, our online business was pandemic. Travel Retail was more like 26% pre-pandemic. But in terms of the operating margin for fiscal '24, as you can imagine, with some of the more recent events, we are still going through what our expectations are for fiscal '24, and we'll certainly provide guidance as we normally do in the August time frame. I think 20% is a little ambitious right now for fiscal '24 based on what we're seeing. But some of that has to do with how currency moves, which was my previous comment in terms of if you have projections on currency, let me know. But certainly, in terms of the business fundamentals, the growth, we would expect obviously more margin expansion that is in our normal algorithm for fiscal '24 because of the recovery of volume. And obviously, when you're down in volume as we are this year, as much as we protect the strategic investments, but also make choiceful discretionary investments as well. Volume solves a lot of sins. And so we would expect more leverage on our expense base next year, certainly than we're able to get this year. practically because of the volume trends and as well as the shocks in terms of those hits have occurred and how fast we can react to them. So again, we are expecting a certainly progressive fiscal '24.  And with all of the things that we spoke about in the prepared remarks as it relates to the investments that we made that will come online, we'll have a new factory operational in Asia that will make our time to market shorter, will have the new innovation center, which will start to contribute to the development of product for us in the future, et cetera. So all of those things that we said in the prepared marks should also support the acceleration of growth in fiscal '24. Now for your travel -- or more on your travel retail question, I'll turn it to Fabrizio.\nFabrizio Freda : Yes. Thank you, Tracey. Also, I want to add on the margin thing is the first step of normalization of our margin that Tracey is describing on top of volume is also -- will depend on which volume. Because, obviously, if you assume that the normalization of business would be in travel retail in China, then you are assuming that the normalization will be in skin care that tend to be higher margin. So there will be a moment of recovery and normalization. And then from there, we will restart our normal algorithm. And obviously, we will see how the normalization trends evolve and how long they will take. But that will be the way we will move back -- in terms of the travel retail question, stress clarified before and then even more during coded. But the -- you are asking about the -- what are the key dynamics in that retail. So the dynamics in fiber details will be, first of all, Hainan is now established.  And yes, I said that when the international travel of the Chinese consumers will restart, Heinen will not be cannibalized in a big way is Hainan is now well-established vacation place for Chinese, for internal travel is, yes, there are different target groups. The high-end travel is obviously more affordable, easy does require visa doesn't require a passport, by the way. Keep in mind that at least before COVID, I do not have the last information now that everything is changing on the Visa model. But before Covis less than 20% of Chinese had a passport. And so there is anyway 80% of Chinese debt will go to Hainan and they will not travel internationally in this model.  So Hainan will continue and will continue to develop. The addition will be the international charter, which is coming back. in an important way. And then obviously, the Korea and rest of Asia, so Korea has always been a very big business. But as you know, Hong Kong, Macau, Japan were all very important travel retail businesses that now will improve. And so there will be different levels of growth, obviously, in all of this. Now in term of categories, the -- because of the prevalence of Chinese consumer Asia travelers in general, as percentage of the total global travel retail, skin care is a very important category. So the travel retail acceleration in the future will carry, as I was saying before, skin care. And so this will be a double positive impact on marginality and profitability is that combination is powerful. And then by category, we see in Travel Retail a strong acceleration of the fragrance category, particularly the high-end fragrance category, which is, again, profitable and very interesting category for the consumers in this moment.  We observed many travel retail partners around the world, making more space for the high-end fragrance development in the future of travel retail. So that's another important positive. And then the last point I want to make is keep in mind that the travel retail is driven by increased traffic and by increased conversion. The numbers that were available before covered in a normalized way in 2019 were depending which part of the world, the travelers to buy as conversion was between 10% and 15%. And -- we know also that when there is retail like in China and Korea, so where people can buy online before they go to the airport, this conversion number increased substantially -- and there is a lot of retail business that has developed very well in Asia, particularly linked to Hainan.  And so the amount of conversion of these travelers is increasing -- and last thing I want to say is that the comeback of Chinese consumers in international travel is very good news because the Chinese consumer, when they travel used to have much more purchase per person than the average travelers from different regions. So the increase in mix of Chinese travelers is very good news for global travel retail as well. So in the post corded world, when will be really postal I think we are going to see some years of exciting opportunity globally in the travel retail development.\nOperator: We have time for one more question. It is from Mark Astrachan of Stifel.\nMark Astrachan: Yes, I wanted to ask about the sustainability of growth in some of these categories, which benefited from reopening like fragrances makeup and expectations for skin care improvement, it sounds like you\u2019re obviously talking to improving skin care trends globally, obviously, China as well. And then I wanted to ask the same question around China. So should we expect a similar reopening trajectory? Or are you expecting a similar reopening trajectory in China that we\u2019ve seen around the rest of the world in terms of growth and in terms of the categories which benefit.\nFabrizio Freda: SP-2 So the reopening of China is in China today, the level of sales online is the biggest percentage of the world. So to be clear, the reopening on China will mainly impact the reopening of brick-and-mortar. So will impact 50% of the business in China about will be very positively impacted by the reopening.  Obviously, during the period, like the 1 we just lived many since mid-November to mid-January, where the level of infections in China, so COVID were super high. 80% of families had somebody with the virus, et cetera. So the implications were normal. In this period, you see also a reduced consumption. Everything, reduce consumption online, reduce interest for sure it make up in other categories. So, but that\u2019s temporary, obviously. So your question is more what happened when all this is regular. The only thing I want to clarify that has to be regular, not only the ability to purchase in stores, but also, frankly, to be free of COVID, really free of COVID [indiscernible] consumption come back. So when people will be free of COVID as a disease.  When they will go back to the brick-and-mortar, we will see at least half of the business in China increasing dramatically on traffic, and we will see a continuous acceleration, a gradual continuous accusation of the online, which is already very strong. There are many new platforms online that have been opened in China as we speak, which are promising, which are doing success. In our case, our success on JD to win has been very, very strong. It\u2019s one of the reasons behind the market share growth and the success of the amazing Tmall events, particularly 11.11 or June 18 have been extraordinary. So there are a lot of good potential levers of growth. That will be activated by the comeback of consumers. Then you are asking about the categories that will be a. First of all, skin care will be the biggest beneficial for the simple reason that skin care is the biggest percentage of beauty business in China. To be clear, that\u2019s not the case in Europe or in U.S., where there are other categories which are a bigger percentage of the total business.  So this is a unique profile of the Chinese consumer, where skin care will be the biggest benefit benefiting the biggest from the normalization of the consumption patterns and of the purchase partners of the consumer. Second, fragrance is on a roll in China. Fragrance was already growing before COVID, has been growing during the period where Chinese at lower COVID levels than the rest of the world. And will continue to grow with a reopening because there is a clear passionate development of this category. In China, the fragrance category is developing bigger percentage at the high end where we are focused \u2013 so the high-end fragrance is actually a much bigger percentage of the total market than in the rest of the world, which is grains for the development of this category.  Makeup would also makeup is the cutter which is most affected by carbon situation. So now it\u2019s the most affected. By the way, it\u2019s been the most affected everywhere in the world by the COVID situation, not only in China. And so the resurgence of makeup that we are seeing in this moment in U.S., in Europe and some of our brands, particularly Mac, is benefiting from this very well. Will happen also in China when COVID will normalize. And last, we have launched a data in China for a reason that we have seen the clear signs of development of luxury haircare. Obviously, hair care is a category super well developed among the Chinese consumers, but it\u2019s mainly developed in mass is the beginning of the journey of the development of a luxury hair care sustainable hair care part. And so that\u2019s really also exciting and is in front of us for the future development.\nA \u2013Tracey Travis : And in terms of fragrance [indiscernible] continue to expand our fragrance portfolio. We\u2019re certainly seeing a pickup and expecting a pickup in travel retail as it relates to fragrance, and fragrance is still a growing category in Asia. So certainly, during the recovery, we expect that fragrance trends will continue to grow, particularly in the markets that are reopening now.\nOperator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session.

            "name": "Fabrizio Freda",
            "content": "Thank you, Rainey, and hello to everyone. It is good to be with you today. Turning to results. For the second quarter of fiscal year 2023, organic sales fell 11% and which was within our outlook despite the incremental pressure of COVID-19 resurgence in China.  Many developed and emerging markets globally outperformed our expectations to offset the COVID-related impacts of significantly reduced retail traffic as well as limited staffing in beauty adviser, in domestic China and Travel Retail in Hainan in November and December. Adjusted EPS fell 45%. While its deep decline, this was meaningfully better than our outlook, driven by both disciplined expense management and moderation of the stronger U.S. dollars.  Importantly, we continue to prudently invest for growth, launching thought after innovation and increasing A&P as a percentage of sales. For fiscal year 2023, we are lowering our outlook for organic sales growth and adjusted diluted EPS primarily for 2 reasons. First, inventory levels in Hainan remains somewhat more elevated than we expected due to the disruptions in travel and in-store staffing levels in November and December. Second, the recently announced potential rollback of COVID related supportive measures in Korea Duty Free are creating a near-term transitory pressure to our business with our courier duty-free retailers.  In the third quarter, it is more than offsetting the initial positive impact from the resumption of international travel by Chinese consumers as well as favorable trends in our second quarter, including outstanding performance across many developed markets in Western Europe and Asia Pacific as well as many emerging markets globally and a better-than-expected currency environment. All told, our return to growth has shifted from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, which Tracey will discuss in greater detail. We remain focused on investing in our brands including for innovation, advertising, strategic entry into new countries and expanded consumer reach to fuel our multiple engines of growth strategy. Our growth engines in the second quarter were many among categories, regions and channels, and we anticipate the gradual return of more growth engines across the second half of fiscal year 2023. Beginning with categories. Fragrance extended its long-running double-digit organic sales growth streak in the second quarter, rising 12%. We are inspired by the growth prospects still ahead for the luxury and artisanal segment of the category. As consumer [indiscernible] unique distinct and long lasting sense of the highest quality. Many of today, consumers seek to build an occasion-based collection to express on sell differently across seasons, time of the day or events. Our portfolios of Jo Malone London, Tom Ford Beauty, Le Labo, KILIAN PARIS, Editions de Parfums Frederic Malle is ideally positioned for this accelerating fundamental shift. As demand increases globally, we are excited about our plans to bring these brands to new markets and channels in the coming quarters. Innovation will also continue to be a key growth pillar. For example, Tom Ford Beauty outstanding loans or [indiscernible] in the first half will be followed by the cherry collection in the second half, building on the success of regional hero last cherry. Makeup grew organically in the Americas as well as the domestic markets EMEA in across southeast Asia in the second quarter. Our brands are indeed realized in the promise of the category [indiscernible] as professional and personal use education feed on point innovation, alluring marketing campaigns on new platforms and I think artist. MAC was a standout success. The brand growth engines were many, freestanding doors excelled, welcoming consumers with expert services delivering double-digit organic sales growth globally. Across channels, blockbuster innovation, hero products and holiday merchandise proved highly sort. Clinic further fueled makeup across subcategories led by list as the brand has created a hero franchise with [indiscernible] almost lipstick in black honey. Estee Lauder Double Wear foundation had exceptional success with Its My Shade, My Story campaign in Western Europe. Virality on TikTok drove strong new consumer acquisition and the franchise strengthened its #1 ranking foundation with prestige beauty share gains.  Looking ahead, we are excited for the launch of Estee Lauder Pure Color lipstick in the second half. The brand reinvented its iconic franchise to capitalize on lipstick revival and integrate skin care benefits for lips. -- designed to flatter all skin tones across mat, cream and luster finishes the line packaging peso edge to the brand original lipstick from the 1960s. In hair care, our brands extended the category organic sales growth streak to 8 consecutive quarters. for the second half, did launch last July in Mainland China will be complemented by the brand recent entry into Travel Retail in Haina. -- as we continue investing for the vibrant growth opportunity of prestige hair care with the Chinese consumers. Moreover, Avida became a certified B Corporation, joining Le Labo in our portfolio in achieving these important third-party validation as the brand deepened its decades-long commitment to social and environmental responsibility. Skin Care organic sales fell sharply in the second quarter.  There were a few headwinds with the biggest challenge being COVID-19 in travel retail in Asia and with the Chinese consumer, given the category's exposure. Amin, the top landscape for skin care, the ordinary was a striking success. Its organic sales growth accelerated from high single digit in the first quarter to strong double digits in the second quarter. The brand's hero product excelled as did the blockbuster innovation of multiple tail lash and brow serum, while the ordinary also realized outstanding performance in the specialty multichannel again, momentum for its exciting launch in India in the fourth quarter of last year. We are focused on returning skin care to growth globally with sequentially improving trends from the third quarter to the fourth quarter as a transitory pressure from travel retail abate. To that end, we have an incredibly rich innovation pipeline primed to launch. Here a few among them. Already out from MAC is its new hyper-real franchise as the brand leverage its expertise to create an artist approved skin care line of products which are purposely designed to perform also with makeup. La Air revamped motorizing soft cream arrived this month with powerful new clinical results to reverse and receive visible signs of aging. Thereafter, Clinique will bring most Sud SPS to market. extend its popular hero product to meet consumer desire for hydration and some protection with a lightweight texture that has made MotorSerge100 age and Icon. With these launches, we aim to reach new consumers demographic tapped into high-growth subsegment.  Let me now turn to geographies. While the U.S. and domestic China were challenged in the second quarter with sales falling single digit organically in each market, we believe both will be growth engines in the second half. For the U.S., we are optimistic for a return to growth given sequentially improving monthly trend in each of organic sales and retail sales performance throughout the second quarter.  Building on this momentum, the market is equipped with numerous growth drivers, including an exceptional innovation pipeline across brands roll out of new Clinique counters to select doors after a successful pilot of Clinique lab in [indiscernible] and launch of exclusive products by many brands in specialty-multi. We are also progressively modernizing numerous freestanding store as they are primed to be an important contributor to growth following rationalization of the footprint.  Moreover, our enhanced omnichannel capabilities are also primed to contribute to growth in the U.S. as consumers who engage with our brands online and in store drive consistently higher value from upsell and cross-sell. This was especially true during holidays in the second quarter. For domestic China, we are confident in a vibrant recovery for our business following the relaxing of cove restriction. -- as the economy is well positioned to rebound and Chinese consumers are passion for prestige beauty.  We entered this phase with momentum having expanded our market share of prestige but in China during the second quarter, driven by gains on all of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care demonstrating that this ability of our aspirational brand portfolio and the excellent go-to-market strategies of our local team. While the third quarter is set to be more variable, because of the high level of covet cases, we now anticipate even stronger organic sales growth as of the fourth quarter as recovery evolves. We expect online to continue its strengths and anticipate a gradual return to more fulsome brick-and-mortar traffic by the end of the fiscal year. Online organic sales rose single digit in the second quarter, fueled by many brands led by La Mer double-digit growth. We achieved excellent results for 11 as the Estee Lauder brand realized top ranks across platforms. Moreover, our retail sales growth in online channel meaningfully outpaced the industry in the quarter for strong prestige beauty share gains. Beyond the U.S. and China, we realized outstanding organic sales growth in many large developed and emerging markets around the world. Our local team has been executing with excellence to deliver broad-based sales gains. Western Europe, led by the U.K. prospered, while Japan and Australia contributed strongly in Asia Pacific. India, Brazil, Turkey and Malaysia are among the stars of our emerging markets with each posting strong double-digit organic sales growth led by India, rising nearly 50%. We are very encouraged with the excellent performance we are delivering in emerging markets. As these emerging markets evolve in recovery from the pandemic, we foresee compelling long-term growth opportunity arising from the expanding middle class trading up into prestige beauty.  We entered this important phase of recovery from a position of strength as we hold leading prestige beauty share in many of these markets. For example, in India, Mexico, South Africa, we are the #1 rent company in both prestige makeup and skincare, while we lead in prestige makeup in Malaysia, Thailand and Turkey. Let me now turn to the strategic deal we announced in November to acquire Tom 4. This transformational luxury acquisition will make Tumor an own brand of stellate companies. enabling us to manage the brand's intellectual property and equity. Staying true to our focus as a pure play in prestige beauty. We have also reached agreements with luxury companies, ZenyaGroup and Marcolin to license the brand fashion and eyewear businesses, respectively. We first partnered with Tom Ford over 15 years ago, and a singular vision of model luxury is beyond compare. Together, we have elevated to for beauty into the top echelon of high-growth luxury beauty impressively. TolfBeauty is expected to achieve $1 billion in net sales annually over the next couple of years, and we are promising profitable growth opportunities ahead.  Before I close, I want to recognize the start of black Easter month in the U.S. and thank our employees to have created an engaging calendar of events for colleagues and consumers to celebrate and honor the black experience. while we continue to focus on accelerating our commitment to raise our equity and the collective accomplishment of our equity goals year-round. In closing, while we are lowering our fiscal year 2023 outlook to reflect the additional transitory pressures affecting our Travel Retail business, -- we are encouraged by both the strong underlying trends in many other areas of our business and improving macro trends. Inflation has stabilized in many markets globally the strength of the U.S. dollar has moderated. And the return to mobility domestically and international travel is happening earlier than expected. Moreover, in the first half of fiscal year 2023, we made exciting progress on several strategic initiatives to drive growth and resiliency in our business. We significantly strengthened our capabilities in innovation, manufacturing and distribution have opened the China innovation labs our first plant in Asia Pacific, our new DC in China, while we also announced our brand portfolio with Tom Ford and Balmain Beauty. All told, we have great confidence that we will emerge from this volatile transitional year, even better positioned to realize the long-term growth opportunity of global prestige beauty to our employees, our future is bright because of your creativity, passion and wisdom. I extend my deepest gratitude for your significant contribution to our long-term success.  And now I turn the call over to Tracey. Yes. No. Absolutely, with pleasure. Let me start with China, first of all. And so China, the results in the quarter where pretty good. We built significant market share. So the overall market in China was negative double digit. Our net sales were and our retail was negative single digits, and we built market share in every single category. So in most arises, we build market share in makeup in fragrance, in health care in every aspect.  Now this, for us, is a very important sign that the -- our brands are really working the aspirational value of our brands remains very, very strong, which in the moment of reopening is a very strong position to be. So excellent performance relatively to market. Though some of our brands were shining, La Mer in skin care was the brand that was gaining the best market share on for beauty in makeup and Jo Malone London in fragrance was really leading the share gain. The other important reading of China is that during 11/11, our net sales were up 10.9%, and our retail sales were up 11.9% and holding the #1 ranking across various categories. and there was a lot of great success on the brand creative activity in live streaming on innovation. And so the way when the consumers are back in this very difficult volatile period like a situation like 11.11, where there is obviously high traffic our brands respond enormously. And obviously, when the consumers are not back or don't travel or our site is when, obviously, we have seen some issues. So in total, China is developing the way we planned. And from a market share standpoint, recovering also and is definitely going in the right direction. In terms of the future, the potential of China, we continue to see now the opening to create a gain traffic in Mainland, in brick-and-mortar, we see the continuation of the line success. And we see the -- obviously, the reopening of Hainan. And so the Chinese consumer on all fronts. Also, we see the fact that the Chinese consumer is starting to travel internationally. [indiscernible] and this will gradually increase as the governments will agree theses and models of growth. In this moment, there are parts of the world we already opened, others we will open soon Japan, we understand it's been an agreement, but it's not yet open, we'll be in soon. Korea is the 1 where the agreement is not yet finalized, but we are optimistic that in the future, this also would be resolved. So that's another very important trend. This will have a positive impact, obviously, in our retail channel, but also in the countries of destination, like it's always been historically happened. In terms of categories in China, obviously, the most important thing that will happen as the China accelerate on all fronts will be the skin care will accelerate for us. And so the acceleration of Travel Retail Asia, the Aleris China, the acceleration of international travel of Chinese, which we had in front of us in part in quarter 4, but in part in -- fiscal year 2024. This will will generate a substantial improvement of our skin care trends that, in turn, will have a positive impact on our margin mix. So that's obviously an important element of the program.  Then other regions of the world. As I commented in my prepared remarks, has been very strong in Europe where we built market share. in most of the European markets. Very strong in the rest of Asia, particularly strong gains in Japan and Australia, as I commented already. And in Korea, excluding the travel retail impacts, that are particularly heavy on our Dejar brand, which has a big percentage in Travel Retail, excluding that also Korea started progressing very well. So good progress in all the other regions. Then North America. Now in North America, obviously, we also continue to lose share in the quarter. And overall, we would like to accelerate our plan of share recovery. But the good news is there's been very strong progress in quarter 2. Every single month, October, November and then December, there was progress in top line sales acceleration. First of all, in retail, the quarter in the U.S. ended plus 2%, so on the positive. But December was plus 6.5%, 7%. So in line with our goals of acceleration. So we see the U.S. progressing. Now the next 6 months, there is an even stronger plan. In the U.S., we have a strong acceleration of innovation. I mentioned already some in the in the prepared remarks like Estee Lauder Pachorolistic, Moreso Sudo Clinique, Hyperion Marc, soft cream on La Mer, cherry collection to Ford. So -- and then we have some important distribution improvement. We are deploying more distribution in department store of our high-end fragrances in Macy's in dealers the ordinary is entering some doors and strands.  We are deploying in Ulta and in Sephora new, incremental [indiscernible] and incremental expansion of our key brands in these doors. And we are renovating 100 free stand store opening 8 new freshen stores and continue to improve our omnichannel capabilities on all fronts. So we see an acceleration of our progress also in the U.S. So in summary, when I should add what Tracey also underline that at the same time, we have improved our capability behind this program. Our digital marketing is strong. Our supply chain is shortened and faster. Obviously, we have done progress in our factory in Japan, our R&D has opened our R&D center in China that will increase the amount of local relevant innovations in Asia in an important way in the next fiscal year -- starting this fiscal year in a significant way. And we have opened a new distribution on the serves travel retail in Switzerland and on the service, obviously, China, within China, as we discussed also in the last call. So there are all these investments and progresses in capabilities that make us ready the reacceleration in the future. And so this fiscal year, in summary, has been a year where, really, we suffered about the COVID lockdowns, particularly in Asia. And then the high level of infections during the reopening and the impact of the strength of the U.S. dollar that was particularly big in our high profit, high important channels like travel retail, like China, travel retails because on core and China, the dollar was particularly impactful. So it was really a perfect storm kind of situation. But all the rest, apart from these 3 areas really progressed and in some cases, very successful in market share gaining. So that's my overview. I hope to answer your question that having an overview of the situation. but I would say is very, very encouraging for the recovery period. Yes. Thank you, Tracey. Also, I want to add on the margin thing is the first step of normalization of our margin that Tracey is describing on top of volume is also -- will depend on which volume. Because, obviously, if you assume that the normalization of business would be in travel retail in China, then you are assuming that the normalization will be in skin care that tend to be higher margin. So there will be a moment of recovery and normalization. And then from there, we will restart our normal algorithm. And obviously, we will see how the normalization trends evolve and how long they will take. But that will be the way we will move back -- in terms of the travel retail question, stress clarified before and then even more during coded. But the -- you are asking about the -- what are the key dynamics in that retail. So the dynamics in fiber details will be, first of all, Hainan is now established.  And yes, I said that when the international travel of the Chinese consumers will restart, Heinen will not be cannibalized in a big way is Hainan is now well-established vacation place for Chinese, for internal travel is, yes, there are different target groups. The high-end travel is obviously more affordable, easy does require visa doesn't require a passport, by the way. Keep in mind that at least before COVID, I do not have the last information now that everything is changing on the Visa model. But before Covis less than 20% of Chinese had a passport. And so there is anyway 80% of Chinese debt will go to Hainan and they will not travel internationally in this model.  So Hainan will continue and will continue to develop. The addition will be the international charter, which is coming back. in an important way. And then obviously, the Korea and rest of Asia, so Korea has always been a very big business. But as you know, Hong Kong, Macau, Japan were all very important travel retail businesses that now will improve. And so there will be different levels of growth, obviously, in all of this. Now in term of categories, the -- because of the prevalence of Chinese consumer Asia travelers in general, as percentage of the total global travel retail, skin care is a very important category. So the travel retail acceleration in the future will carry, as I was saying before, skin care. And so this will be a double positive impact on marginality and profitability is that combination is powerful. And then by category, we see in Travel Retail a strong acceleration of the fragrance category, particularly the high-end fragrance category, which is, again, profitable and very interesting category for the consumers in this moment.  We observed many travel retail partners around the world, making more space for the high-end fragrance development in the future of travel retail. So that's another important positive. And then the last point I want to make is keep in mind that the travel retail is driven by increased traffic and by increased conversion. The numbers that were available before covered in a normalized way in 2019 were depending which part of the world, the travelers to buy as conversion was between 10% and 15%. And -- we know also that when there is retail like in China and Korea, so where people can buy online before they go to the airport, this conversion number increased substantially -- and there is a lot of retail business that has developed very well in Asia, particularly linked to Hainan.  And so the amount of conversion of these travelers is increasing -- and last thing I want to say is that the comeback of Chinese consumers in international travel is very good news because the Chinese consumer, when they travel used to have much more purchase per person than the average travelers from different regions. So the increase in mix of Chinese travelers is very good news for global travel retail as well. So in the post corded world, when will be really postal I think we are going to see some years of exciting opportunity globally in the travel retail development. SP-2 So the reopening of China is in China today, the level of sales online is the biggest percentage of the world. So to be clear, the reopening on China will mainly impact the reopening of brick-and-mortar. So will impact 50% of the business in China about will be very positively impacted by the reopening.  Obviously, during the period, like the 1 we just lived many since mid-November to mid-January, where the level of infections in China, so COVID were super high. 80% of families had somebody with the virus, et cetera. So the implications were normal. In this period, you see also a reduced consumption. Everything, reduce consumption online, reduce interest for sure it make up in other categories. So, but that's temporary, obviously. So your question is more what happened when all this is regular. The only thing I want to clarify that has to be regular, not only the ability to purchase in stores, but also, frankly, to be free of COVID, really free of COVID [indiscernible] consumption come back. So when people will be free of COVID as a disease.  When they will go back to the brick-and-mortar, we will see at least half of the business in China increasing dramatically on traffic, and we will see a continuous acceleration, a gradual continuous accusation of the online, which is already very strong. There are many new platforms online that have been opened in China as we speak, which are promising, which are doing success. In our case, our success on JD to win has been very, very strong. It's one of the reasons behind the market share growth and the success of the amazing Tmall events, particularly 11.11 or June 18 have been extraordinary. So there are a lot of good potential levers of growth. That will be activated by the comeback of consumers. Then you are asking about the categories that will be a. First of all, skin care will be the biggest beneficial for the simple reason that skin care is the biggest percentage of beauty business in China. To be clear, that's not the case in Europe or in U.S., where there are other categories which are a bigger percentage of the total business.  So this is a unique profile of the Chinese consumer, where skin care will be the biggest benefit benefiting the biggest from the normalization of the consumption patterns and of the purchase partners of the consumer. Second, fragrance is on a roll in China. Fragrance was already growing before COVID, has been growing during the period where Chinese at lower COVID levels than the rest of the world. And will continue to grow with a reopening because there is a clear passionate development of this category. In China, the fragrance category is developing bigger percentage at the high end where we are focused \u2013 so the high-end fragrance is actually a much bigger percentage of the total market than in the rest of the world, which is grains for the development of this category.  Makeup would also makeup is the cutter which is most affected by carbon situation. So now it's the most affected. By the way, it's been the most affected everywhere in the world by the COVID situation, not only in China. And so the resurgence of makeup that we are seeing in this moment in U.S., in Europe and some of our brands, particularly Mac, is benefiting from this very well. Will happen also in China when COVID will normalize. And last, we have launched a data in China for a reason that we have seen the clear signs of development of luxury haircare. Obviously, hair care is a category super well developed among the Chinese consumers, but it's mainly developed in mass is the beginning of the journey of the development of a luxury hair care sustainable hair care part. And so that's really also exciting and is in front of us for the future development.\nA \u2013Tracey Travis:And in terms of fragrance [indiscernible] continue to expand our fragrance portfolio. We're certainly seeing a pickup and expecting a pickup in travel retail as it relates to fragrance, and fragrance is still a growing category in Asia. So certainly, during the recovery, we expect that fragrance trends will continue to grow, particularly in the markets that are reopening now."

            "name": "Tracey Travis",
            "content": "Thank you, Fabrizio, and hello, everyone. As Fabrizio mentioned, our business in the second quarter continued to be pressured by the external headwinds of COVID-related impacts, including the rising number of COVID cases in China, lower shipments of replenishment orders in the U.S. and the stronger U.S. dollar. Our second quarter organic net sales declined 11% and earnings per share decreased 49% to $1.54.  We tighter expense management and a slightly improved currency impact contributed to our better-than-expected EPS results. From a geographic standpoint, organic net sales in the Americas declined 3%. The -- we saw healthy demand for our holiday offerings as consumers gravitated to our in-store and online promotions. However, we also experienced lower shipments of replenishment orders due to both retailer inventory tightening as we anticipated, and a later improvement in retail trends post-Christmas. In Latin America, organic net sales rose double digits, reflecting continued growth in nearly all markets, the evolution of recovery and makeup as consumers return to stores, and the strength of our fragrance portfolio. Organic net sales in our Europe, the Middle East and Africa region declined 17%, including the negative impact from foreign currency transactions and key international travel retail locations of 3%. The decline was driven by travel retail as expected, while growth from nearly every market in the rest of the region was strong. Our global travel retail sales were significantly pressured by the ongoing COVID-related impacts. Despite stores being opened throughout the quarter, travel to Hainan remain largely curtailed, and as a result, shipments of replenishment inventory remained low. Elsewhere, we experienced strong sales growth in Travel Retail, reflecting increased international tourism as travel restrictions in many countries lifted from the prior year. The ongoing pressures in Asia travel retail more than offset the growth we experienced in the rest of the EMEA region, including both developed and emerging markets such as the United Kingdom, France, India and Turkey. We continue to see various stages of recovery across the region that coupled with the strong resumption of tourism fueled brick-and-mortar growth during the quarter. Organic net sales in our Asia Pacific region fell 7%, primarily due to the ongoing COVID-related impacts in Greater China. This affected brick-and-mortar sales in Greater China and Dr. Jart Travel Retail in Korea. Online sales continued to grow in Mainland China due in part to the expansion of our online presence with the recent launches on JD and Joyn as well as solid performance during the 11.11 Shopping Festival. Most of the other markets in the region continued to progress in recovery as the return of brick-and-mortar traffic led to high single-digit or double-digit growth in Japan, Australia, Malaysia and the Philippines. From a category standpoint, fragrance continued to lead growth with organic net sales rising 12%. Strong holiday demand for our beautiful line of fragrances from Estee Lauder and double-digit growth from both La La bond Tom Ford Beauty propelled the category's growth in every region during the quarter. Organic net sales in hair care rose 4% and declined 3% in makeup, the latter driven primarily by the COVID restrictions in China as solid performance from both MAC and Clinique drove growth in both the Americas and in domestic markets in EMEA.  Organic net sales in skin care declined 20%. This category continues to be the most affected by the COVID restrictions in China, particularly in Asia travel retail and Mainland China, where skin care accounts for a large majority of our business. Our gross margin declined 430 basis points compared to last year. The positive impacts from strategic pricing in this quarter were more than offset by inflationary pressures in our supply chain, region and category mix, and higher costs due to promotional items. Operating expenses increased 500 basis points as a percent of sales, driven primarily by the reduction in sales. This also reflects our investments in areas such as advertising, promotional activities and innovation, which increased 150 basis points compared to last year. Operating income declined 46% to $768 million, and our operating margin contracted 930 basis points to 16.6% in the quarter.  During the quarter, we recorded $207 million of impairment charges related to the 3 brands, primarily reflecting lower-than-expected growth in key geographic regions and channels given the pressure on consumer demand from the impacts of COVID. Diluted EPS of $1.54 decreased 49% compared to last year. The impact from foreign currency translation and foreign currency transactions in key travel retail locations negatively impacted diluted EPS and by 5% and 4%, respectively. During the quarter, we generated $751 million in net cash flows from operating activities compared to $1.8 billion last year. The decline from last year reflects lower net income and the negative impact from changes in working capital, primarily due to the timing of payments. We invested $419 million in capital expenditures, and we returned $708 million in cash to stockholders through both dividends and share repurchases. As we expected, our first half performance was pressured by ongoing external headwinds. Let me now turn to our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2023. For the second half of fiscal 2023, we are encouraged by the easing of COVID restrictions in China and the expected return of travelers throughout Asia and around the world once more stabilization occurs with outbound flights and visas as well as cover entry and testing requirements. In Hainan, we are starting to see increased positive signs already. as traffic level declines have moderated in recent months. However, retailer inventory levels are still somewhat elevated, reflecting the impact of the lengthy store closures as well as the rapid reduction in traffic and in-store staffing levels in November and December. And in Korea travel retail, an incremental headwind has emerged since the last outlook we provided in November. The recently announced potential rollback of COVID-related supportive measures in Korea Duty Free is creating a near-term transitory pressure to our business with our Korean duty-free retailers, which is pressuring our third quarter outlook. We now also expect more moderate net sales growth near term in our China business as the rise of Cove cases in November and December slowed expected brick-and-mortar retail traffic and social usage occasions. -- which continued in January during the pre-Lunar New Year shopping time frame. Collectively, we expect these impacts to create greater headwinds in the third quarter than we originally anticipated.  As a result, we are updating our outlook to reflect a shift in the start of the travel retail recovery in Asia from the third to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 due to the normalization of inventory levels in Hainan, the uncertain pace of recovery of travel retail traffic in Korea and a more moderate acceleration of growth in China. The momentum from our other developed and emerging markets in EMEA and Asia Pacific in the first half is expected to continue as those markets progressively evolve in recovery. We are also cautiously optimistic and expect our North America net sales performance to improve as our retail growth trend in the region has already increased, particularly in January. -- and we have a supportive innovation pipeline planned for the second half, as Fabrizio mentioned. As it relates to our operating income, while these external headwinds have introduced a high level of volatility and that has had a meaningful impact on our financial results this fiscal year. We remain confident in the ongoing strength of prestige beauty, our business strategy and our ability to reaccelerate long-term profitable growth. We, therefore, plan to sustain the strategic investments imperative to that growth, including innovation, advertising and continued geographic expansion for many of our brands. These investments also support the continued strengthening of our multiple engines of growth as we invest in emerging markets and faster growth channels that are already progressing well in their recovery. As a result, we expect to see pressure on our operating income in the third quarter with an accelerated improvement in the fourth quarter as the sales recovery in travel retail, Mainland China, and skin care start to materialize more meaningfully. The negative impacts from foreign currency that we anticipated in our previous guidance have improved due to the recent weakening of the U.S. dollar. However, currency is still expected to be a meaningful drag our reported sales and diluted EPS growth for the third quarter and full year. Our outlook is now based on December 30 spot rates of 1.067 for the euro, 1.207 for the pound, 6.964 for the Chinese yuan and 12.63 for the Korean yuan. So with that backdrop, our guidance is as follows: we expect organic sales for our third quarter to decline 10% to 8%, primarily reflecting the pressures to our Travel Retail business that I mentioned previously. Currency translation is expected to be dilutive to reported net sales by 3 points and the impact of certain foreign currency transactions in key international travel locations is not expected to be material. The impact of sales from certain designer fragrance license exits are expected to dilute reported growth by approximately 1 point. We expect third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.37 to $0.47 for a decline between 81% to 75%. Currency translation is expected to be dilutive to EPS by $0.04, such that constant currency adjusted EPS is expected to decline between 79% to 73%. This includes the negative impact from certain foreign currency transactions and key international travel retail locations of approximately 1 percentage point.  For the full year, SP27916451 assuming a reacceleration of Travel Retail [indiscernible] in the full range between down 2% to flat. Currency translation is expected to dilute reported sales growth for the full fiscal year by 4 percentage points and we expect an additional 1 point of dilution from the impact of certain foreign currency transactions in key international travel retail locations. The impact of sales from certain designer license exits are expected to dilute reported growth by approximately 1 point. We expect full year operating margin to be approximately 15.1%, a 460 basis point contraction from the prior year period primarily due to the geographical and category mix of sales and foreign currency impacts as well as the sustained investments to support recovery as previously mentioned. We now expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 25.5%, reflecting in part the change in our estimated geographical mix of earnings. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $4.87 and 502 before restructuring and other charges. This includes approximately $0.29 of dilution from currency translation. In constant currency, we expect EPS to fall between 29% and 27%, which includes a negative impact from foreign currency transactions and key international travel retail locations, of approximately 4 percentage points. Regarding the Tom Ford brand acquisition, we expect to complete this transaction in the fourth quarter and to fund it through a combination of cash, debt and deferred payments. In anticipation of closing this transaction, in January, we increased our commercial paper program by $2 billion. We also estimate a slight EPS dilution to the full year outlook that I just provided due to the final purchase accounting inclusive of transaction costs. While this year has undoubtedly been a perfect storm of unforeseen macro pressures on our business, and the transition to accelerated recovery has indeed been longer than we anticipated, we have navigated through the challenging environment and strengthened the company in the process, thanks to our amazing employees, our company values and our multiple engines of growth strategy.  We are encouraged by the many signs of improvement in the overall environment and the progress our incredible teams have made in preparing us for a strong recovery. Our fundamentals are solid and intact, reinforced by the actions we have taken over the past few years. From the acquisition of the majority interest in [indiscernible] in fiscal 2021 to the recent announcement of our agreement to acquire the Tom Ford brand and the Balmain license agreement.  We are expanding our brand portfolio at both the entry and luxury levels of prestige beauty. We've taken strategic actions to enhance our go-to-market capabilities, supply chain agility and local relevance through our new innovation, production and distribution facilities in Asia. We've enhanced our digital marketing capabilities and continue to progress on our ESG initiatives. These actions and many more demonstrate that we remain confident in the long-term sustainable profitable growth of our business. And that concludes our prepared remarks.  We'll be happy to take your questions at this time. Yes. You're correct, Lauren, that we do expect that we will -- two things. One, inventory levels are still coming down in Hainan. They are almost at the level that we would expect sales to accelerate. So yes, you should start to see an inventory build related to the shipments that we expect to see in Q4. In Korea, again, the pace is a little bit more uncertain given the transitory nature of what's going on right now. So we do anticipate, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks that we will start to see resumption of travel in Korea. And depending on the pace of that resumption that will depend on the amount of shipments that we have in the quarter. But we have taken obviously an assumption there. We are sitting on a decent amount of inventory even in our own warehouses to supply the sales that we expect to see in the fourth quarter. So let me just -- and Fabrizio will pick up on your questions on Travel Retail. But Travel Retail actually was larger. You're remembering, Michael, our online business was pandemic. Travel Retail was more like 26% pre-pandemic. But in terms of the operating margin for fiscal '24, as you can imagine, with some of the more recent events, we are still going through what our expectations are for fiscal '24, and we'll certainly provide guidance as we normally do in the August time frame. I think 20% is a little ambitious right now for fiscal '24 based on what we're seeing. But some of that has to do with how currency moves, which was my previous comment in terms of if you have projections on currency, let me know. But certainly, in terms of the business fundamentals, the growth, we would expect obviously more margin expansion that is in our normal algorithm for fiscal '24 because of the recovery of volume. And obviously, when you're down in volume as we are this year, as much as we protect the strategic investments, but also make choiceful discretionary investments as well. Volume solves a lot of sins. And so we would expect more leverage on our expense base next year, certainly than we're able to get this year. practically because of the volume trends and as well as the shocks in terms of those hits have occurred and how fast we can react to them. So again, we are expecting a certainly progressive fiscal '24.  And with all of the things that we spoke about in the prepared remarks as it relates to the investments that we made that will come online, we'll have a new factory operational in Asia that will make our time to market shorter, will have the new innovation center, which will start to contribute to the development of product for us in the future, et cetera. So all of those things that we said in the prepared marks should also support the acceleration of growth in fiscal '24. Now for your travel -- or more on your travel retail question, I'll turn it to Fabrizio."

For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Rainey Mancini. Please go ahead.\nRainey Mancini: Hello. On today\u2019s call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you will find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges and adjustments disclosed in our press release. Unless otherwise stated, all organic net sales growth excludes the non-comparable impacts of acquisitions, divestitures, brand closures and the impact of currency translation. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our press release and on the Investors section of our website. As a reminder, references to online sales include sales we make directly to our consumers through our brand.com sites and through third-party platforms. It also includes estimated sales of our products through our retailers\u2019 websites. [Operator Instructions]  And now I will turn the call over to Fabrizio.\nFabrizio Freda: Thank you, Rainey and hello to everyone. It is good to be with you today. Since we spoke in mid-August, the headwinds of COVID-19 restrictions in China, high inflation globally and a strong U.S. dollar intensified significantly. Amid the increased complexity, we delivered organic sales, down 5%, in line with our outlook and adjusted diluted EPS higher than expected. Even in these conditions, our multiple engines of growth strategy empower us to seize prevailing growth opportunities. Indeed, we realized outstanding performance in many developed and emerging markets around the world to partially offset the impact of COVID-19 restrictions in Asia travel retail and domestic China as well as tighter inventory management by some retailers in the U.S. To reflect this prolonged and heightened external pressure, we are reducing our outlook for fiscal year 2023, most notably for the second quarter. While Tracey will discuss our revised outlook in detail, there are three primary drivers. The first is the impact of ongoing COVID-19 restriction in Asia travel retail, particularly Hainan. The restrictions are leading to a slower return of tourism versus what retailers had anticipated, resulting in tightening of inventories. While it is significant, this near-term temporary pause does not diminish our deep conviction in Hainan for the long-term as it is among the best brand-building destination for new consumers\u2019 acquisition. The second driver is the tightening of inventory by some retailers in the U.S. And the third is the far stronger U.S. dollar. Encouragingly, beyond these headwinds, consumer demand is robust in markets which are emerging from the pandemic, evidenced in the underlying fundamentals of our first quarter results and retail sales growth. Our optimism in the long-term growth opportunities for our brands and for prestige beauty is intact. During fiscal year 2023, we plan to continue investing in our brands, including for innovation, advertising, strategic entry into new countries and expanded consumer reach to grow profitable prestige beauty share. We expect a gradual sequential improvement to low double-digit organic sales growth and high-teens adjusted EPS growth on a reported basis in the second half of fiscal year 2023. As these pressures begin to abate, the momentum in other areas of our business builds and our ongoing investments drive growth. Let me now share some insights from our first quarter. As while we had headwinds, we also had many bright spots that give us confidence in the second half and beyond. We realized double-digit organic sales growth in many large developed and emerging markets around the world. Japan and the UK grew strongly, alongside Brazil, India, the Middle East and Thailand, to name just a few. Brick-and-mortar prospered in these markets as we welcome consumers with high-touch services, engaging activations and newness. Domestic China delivered sequentially improving organic sales trends of down single-digits driven by excellent growth online, a better performance in brick-and-mortar. Our luxury brand, La Mer and Tom Ford Beauty, contributed to online growth as did Aveda and Bobbi Brown, among others. We are very encouraged by the terrific results of our expanded consumer reach on JD and Douyin. From a retail sales perspective in the online channel, we grew nearly twice as fast as prestige beauty in China to gain share. In the U.S., our freestanding store accelerated, benefiting from both enhanced omnichannel capabilities and greater demand for our high-touch services, be it artistry at M\u00b7A\u00b7C or personalization at Jo Malone London and Le Labo. Specialty-multi also performed especially well, powered by traditional stores and enhanced by the partnership of Ulta Beauty at Target and Sephora at Kohl\u2019s. Clinique, M\u00b7A\u00b7C and Bobbi Brown led growth. Given excellent results in Ulta Beauty over the last year, M\u00b7A\u00b7C and Bobbi Brown are further expanding their presence. We continue to see promise in the U.S., evidenced in its overall retail sales growth in prestige beauty despite the recession risk and the strong performance our brands delivered in freestanding stores and specialty-multi. We remain committed to investing in innovation, advertising and granular consumer acquisition strategies as we aim to best capture the market growth opportunities. Looking at brands globally. 13 brands rose organically, collectively increasing high single-digit to represent over half of our organic sales. Among the 13, M\u00b7A\u00b7C excelled in makeup, La Mer in luxury skin care, Jo Malone London in fragrance and Aveda in hair care, while The Ordinary, our newest brand, appeal to consumers with its authenticity and innovative approach to ingredient transparency. Fragrance sales rose an outstanding 18% organically and expanded in every region. Tom Ford Beauty, Jo Malone London, Le Labo, KILIAN Paris and Editions de Parfums Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Malle all contributed, driven by sought-after innovation and heroes as our luxury and artisanal portfolio evolves from strength to strength. For example, Jo Malone London\u2019s momentum continued with gains balanced across the regions. Innovation served as a catalyst for growth. In China, the new Night Collection resonated beautifully as did the limited edition Brit Collection. Globally, the brand brilliantly leveraged its hero strategy, creatively reimagining the power of English Pear & Freesia in a campaign to recruit new consumers. Demand for fragrance was even stronger as ongoing supply issues of glass and componentry constraints this still excellent sales growth. Profitability for fragrance improved despite the significant currency headwinds, further evidence of the benefits derived from our strategic pivot to the higher end of the category. Hair care double-digit organic sales growth was fueled by increasingly diverse growth engines. We were thrilled to launch Aveda in Mainland China, marking our entry in prestige hair care in the market. In the U.S., Bumble and bumble realized gains from strong results in Ulta Beauty at Target and expansions into Macy\u2019s. In skin care, while the Est\u00e9e Lauder, Dr. Jart and Origins brands were most pressured by reduced retail traffic and travel in China, several brands still prospered. La Mer, Bobbi Brown and The Ordinary grew organically driven by coveted heroes and newness to showcase the gains to be had from entry prestige through luxury. Innovation also resonated strongly in skin care, which bodes well for the future when these transitory pressures abate. In China, Est\u00e9e Lauder luxury oriented Re-Nutriv was highly sought-after and the launch of Re-Nutriv Ultimate Diamond transformative brilliant serum boosted overall demand for the franchise. Clinique Smart Clinical Repair gained momentum in China and also in the U.S. as its new moisturizer complemented the regimens popular serum and eye cream, which launched last year. The Clinique Smart franchise benefit from its 360-degree marketing campaign of these three products, featuring powerful scientific credentials and claims. Makeup renaissance was evident as markets both reopened and evolved in recovery. The category growth in emerging market was especially striking a broad-based from Latin America to the Middle East, India and Southeast Asia, while makeup also grew in most developed markets in Western Europe, along with Japan and Korea. M\u00b7A\u00b7C had a remarkable quarter, fueling passion for makeup around the world, growing high single-digits organically. Consumer embraced its unparalleled artistry and the brand\u2019s innovation proved captivating, especially Powder Kiss Velvet Blur Slim Stick for the lipstick finish and elevated packaging as well as M\u00b7A\u00b7CStack mascara. M\u00b7A\u00b7C\u2019s creative marketing activations further contributed to growth. In Southeast Asia and Latin America, the brands TikTok challenges realized standout results, driving significant new consumer acquisition on Lazada\u2019s Super Brand Day, a strong double-digit volume growth across Latin America as over 400 content creators contributed to the campaign. Before I close, I am also pleased to share that today we will release our fiscal year 2022 social impact and sustainability report. It features exciting progress, made possible by the extraordinary efforts of our employees around the world across our ESG areas of focus and previously stated goals. The report also details new goals for electric vehicles, water reduction and responsible sourcing. Finally, on the last few earnings calls, I discussed actions we were taking to make more progress in our commitment to racial equity as well as women advancement and gender equality, which are also reflected in the report. In conclusion, the current external pressures are many. However, as we look ahead, we remain confident in our focus on advancing our long-term growth strategy, further balancing and diversifying our multiple engines and fully leveraging the long-term promise of prestige beauty. We aim for fiscal year 2023 to be another year of progress on our strategy despite the headwinds. In the first quarter alone, we set the stage to expand our luxury portfolio, having announced a deal to create Balmain Beauty with the couture fashion house. We extended our consumer reach in productive distribution in high-growth channels to match success across regions and continue to strategically expand brands into new countries with Aveda launch in domestic China. We also welcome colleagues into our new China innovation labs in Shanghai, amplifying our ability to best create for the Chinese consumer. And we began limited production for skin care in our new manufacturing facility near Tokyo. I would like to close with my deepest thanks to our employees for their exceptional commitment amid the complexity of the environment. Your creativity, wisdom and passion are beyond compare. Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to Tracey.\nTracey Travis: Thank you, Fabrizio and hello everyone. Our first quarter organic net sales declined 5% and earnings per share, was $1.37. Net sales were in line with our expectations and earnings per share exceeded them even with incremental headwinds in the quarter. While sales overall met expectations, our mix of sales was different than we expected. In August, our outlook anticipated that first quarter sales would be negatively impacted by continued COVID restrictions in China and Hainan, with gradual improvement throughout the first half of the fiscal year as the restrictions lifted. However, the impact on our first quarter sales was greater than we anticipated in Hainan as stores were closed for most of the quarter. And as they reopen, traffic remained quite modest, which resulted in lower shipments due to the anticipation of a slower pace of recovery. Our outlook also reflected the comparison to the prior year in the U.S. when certain of our retailers secured shipments earlier for holiday due to supply chains and concerns in stark contrast to the tightening of inventory by retailers this year due to concerns about slower traffic. Our actual results for the quarter reflect even tighter-than-expected inventory management with certain retailers in the U.S. These additional headwinds were somewhat offset by a faster pace of recovery in other parts of Asia-Pacific and in EMEA as well as the benefit of strategic pricing actions we took in July and August. From a geographic standpoint, organic net sales in the Americas declined 3%, reflecting the timing of shipments in the prior year as well as the tightening of inventory this year. The timing of shipments in the U.S. contributed 6 percentage points to the overall region\u2019s prior year growth. In Latin America, nearly all markets grew double-digits, fueled primarily by the strong recovery of makeup. In our Europe, the Middle East and Africa region, organic net sales declined 5%, primarily due to continued challenges in travel retail and APAC, including the negative impact from foreign currency transactions in key international travel retail locations of 2%. Our global travel retail business declined as the ongoing COVID restrictions in China curtailed travel to Hainan. Stores there were closed for most of the quarter and traffic has been slow to return, resulting in lower shipments as we support stricter inventory management with certain retailers. Conversely, travel retail sales in European markets and in the Americas rose triple and double-digits respectively boosted by increasing resumption of professional and personal travel. Net sales in the United Kingdom increased with double-digit growth from The Ordinary. Elsewhere in EMEA, the lifting of COVID restrictions and the return of tourism in the region drove growth in many markets led by India, the Middle East and Turkey and resulted in double-digit growth in brick-and-mortar. Organic net sales in our Asia-Pacific region fell 7% due to the ongoing COVID restrictions impacting brick-and-mortar sales in Greater China and travel retail in Korea. In Korea, double-digit growth from nearly all brands was more than offset by the decline from Dr. Jart\u2019s travel retail business. The rest of the region delivered strong net sales growth led by Thailand, Malaysia and Japan. Many markets in the region continued to recover as restrictions lifted and traffic returned to stores. From a category perspective, fragrance led growth, with organic net sales rising 18%. Strong consumer demand for our brands and innovation drove growth. Our luxury and artisanal brands continue to thrive led by Tom Ford Beauty, Jo Malone London and Le Labo. Net sales from Clinique rose strong double-digits, winning across all regions with the Clinique Happy product franchise. Our hair care net sales rose 11% organically. Aveda led category growth driven by double-digit growth in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, from hero products and strong innovation, including the launch of the Color Control product line. Organic net sales in makeup declined 6% driven by the COVID restrictions in China as well as a difficult comparison to the prior year period due to the timing of shipments for holiday in the U.S. Net sales rose strong double-digits in Southeast Asia and in the emerging markets of EMEA due to strong performance from M\u00b7A\u00b7C, Bobbi Brown and Est\u00e9e Lauder. M\u00b7A\u00b7C continues to be an overall top performer driven by the success of both hero products and strong innovation across the foundation, lips and eye subcategories. Organic net sales in skin care declined 11%. This category has been the most impacted by the COVID restrictions in Hainan, where skin care accounts for a majority of our business. Our gross margin declined 190 basis points compared to the first quarter last year. The positive impacts from strategic pricing were more than offset by higher costs due to promotional items and inflationary pressures in our supply chain. Operating expenses increased 250 basis points as a percent of sales driven by the reduction in sales. Operating income declined 29% to $668 million, and our operating margin contracted 440 basis points to 17% in the quarter. Diluted EPS of $1.37 decreased 28% compared to the prior year, slightly better than expected as a result of effective cost management. The impacts from foreign currency transactions in key travel retail locations and the exit of certain designer licenses negatively impacted diluted EPS by 4% and 3%, respectively. During the quarter, we utilized $650 million in net cash flows from operating activities, reflecting increased working capital, primarily due to the timing of payments and higher inventory levels as well as lower net income. We invested $152 million in capital expenditures for supply chain improvements, online capabilities and distribution expansion. We returned $325 million in cash to stockholders through both dividends and share repurchases. And additionally, this morning, we announced a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend. So again, we delivered our overall quarter one results as we anticipated. Now let\u2019s turn to our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2023. While we believe the headwinds that impacted our first quarter results are largely temporary, it is also apparent that both the timing and speed of the stabilization of inflation and recovery from both the pandemic and currency challenges are uncertain. As retailers in Hainan were prepared for a faster recovery of traffic to the island with their inventory levels of our products, we have further modified our shipments to be more in line with the slower retail environment. And although we expect the adjustment to inventory by certain of our retailers corresponding with potentially lower traffic, to continue into the second quarter, particularly in Hainan, we believe this adjustment will subside in the second half as COVID restrictions ease and consumers begin to travel with less safety restrictions in China. Until that happens, ongoing restrictions are expected to result in lower net sales in these areas. We also anticipate the tighter inventory management in the U.S. to abate in the second half given the still strong demand for our products at retail. We expect the remainder of our first half performance to be pressured as we navigate through these uncertainties. Despite the headwinds to net sales, we remain confident in the strength of our business strategy and expect to sustain our investments to drive long-term profitable growth. We plan to continue to invest in the areas of advertising, innovation, production capacity, consumer engagement as well as new consumer reach and continued strategic entry into new countries for some of our brands. For the second half, we anticipate trends to improve sequentially as restrictions are lifted, travel throughout Greater China, including Hainan, progressively resumes and the tightening of inventory subsides in Asia travel retail and in the U.S. We expect continued recovery in various markets in EMEA and Asia/Pacific for the balance of the year. Currency is also projected to be a significant drag on our reported results in the second quarter and for the full year as the U.S. dollar has continued to rapidly strengthen against key currencies. As we entered fiscal 2023, we took strategic pricing to mitigate higher-than-normal inflation. Both the magnitude and speed of currency movements experienced thus far, combined with inflation, have further suppressed our expectations for the balance of the year. Specifically, based on mid-October spot rates of 0.978 for the euro, 1.122 for the pound, 7.29 for the Chinese yuan and 14.36 for the Korean won, currency translation is anticipated to continue to negatively impact reported sales and diluted EPS growth for the second quarter and for the full year. We expect organic sales for our second quarter to fall 11% to 9%, primarily reflecting the continued risk of disruption in Hainan, leading to further tightening of inventory and continued tightening of inventory by certain retailers in the U.S. Currency translation is expected to be dilutive to reported net sales by 7 points with an additional 2 points due to the impact of certain foreign currency transactions in key international travel locations. The impact of sales from certain designer license exits are expected to dilute reported growth by approximately 1 point. We expect second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.19 to $1.29 forward, a decline between 60% to 57%. Currency translation is expected to be dilutive to EPS by $0.20 such that constant currency adjusted EPS is expected to decline between 54% and 50%. This includes the negative impact from certain foreign currency transactions in key international travel retail locations of approximately 7 percentage points. For the full year, we expect organic sales growth to range from flat to up 2%. Currency translation is expected to dilute reported sales growth for the full fiscal year by 6 percentage points, and we expect an additional 2 points of dilution from the impact of certain foreign currency transactions in key international travel retail locations. The impacts of returns associated with restructuring and other activities and sales from certain designer license exits are each expected to dilute reported growth by approximately 1 point. We expect full year operating margin to be approximately 16.1%, up 360 basis point contraction from the prior year period, primarily due to the geographical mix of sales, foreign currency impacts and the strategic investments I previously mentioned. We now expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 25%, reflecting the change in our estimated geographical mix of earnings and less benefit from excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $5.25 and $5.40 before restructuring and other charges. This includes approximately $0.44 of dilution from currency translation. In constant currency, we expect EPS to fall between 21% to 19%, which includes a negative impact from foreign currency transactions and key international travel retail locations of approximately 10 percentage points. In closing, we remain confident about the long-term prospects for global prestige beauty and in our multiple engines of growth strategy. Despite the temporary external challenges, we plan to continue to invest selectively in strategic priority areas to support the ongoing growth of our amazing brands now and into the future and to gain profitable share globally. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will be happy to take your questions at this time.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey, good morning.\nFabrizio Freda: Good morning, Dara.\nDara Mohsenian: How are you? So obviously, a large cut to top line expectations in terms of organic sales growth for the fiscal year today, but you still sounded pretty enthusiastic about underlying demand for retail in your comments. So can you just give us more detail on how much of the fiscal \u201823 top line revision is more related to the temporary issues in terms of COVID or inventory issues you highlighted as primary reasons versus a second bucket in terms of underlying demand related to the greater macro pressure, etcetera? It\u2019d be helpful to know how much from each of those buckets is driving the top line revision. And then can I just also ask a similar question in regard to \u201824 earnings? How much of sort of the \u201823 earnings degradation versus your prior guidance might extend longer-term? Is your view that it\u2019s more temporary? And I just asked that in relation to what you\u2019ve talked about recently, which is greater flexibility in ad spend more agility to respond to market conditions. Just trying to sort of understand how that plays into the longer-term earnings outlook beyond this year and what we\u2019re seeing this year? Thanks.\nFabrizio Freda: Yes. It\u2019s a complex question, so there is a lot to say. I will start, and then Tracey will join me in \u2013 particularly in the second part of your question. So we are very confident in our retail trend globally and the growth of our business even in this very difficult external complex times. So just to give you an example of this, in North America, our retail was growing in the quarter, mid-single digits. And I could \u2013 I can explain later all the many things, which are going well in this direction. But for example, it\u2019s a quarter where our M\u00b7A\u00b7C brand really demonstrated it is back to growth, with a 22% growth. And for our North America business, to see M\u00b7A\u00b7C retail coming back so strongly is great news because as you know, Clinique and M\u00b7A\u00b7C are a big part of the growth potential of our North America particularly business. So, great news to have M\u00b7A\u00b7C back into growing and market share growing brands in our top brands portfolio. Then when you look at China and you look at Chinese consumers combined, what was the retail in travel retail and the retail in Mainland, in domestic business, we grew mid-single digits, the retail, despite the inventories tightening issues that we have explained in the prepared remarks and in the press release. So there is an underlying strength. Then when you look, for example, to the China domestic recovery from the difficult moment of the Shanghai closure where we couldn\u2019t ship for some time, and we have spoken in the last quarter to the fact that we will be gradually recovering, this \u2013 now the brick-and-mortar remained with less traffic, but we gradually improve the trend. And the decline has been still a decline, but less \u2013 much less than in the previous quarter. And online, where there was no issue of restrictions, we\u2019re growing above the market, double than the market, growing again market share in online in China. Then we spoke about the fact that we are very encouraged in general by the extraordinary progress in the fragrance business. Now we have taken the strategic decision to focus on the luxury of seasonal fragrances, and they are growing. They are profitable. And they are growing more than double digit, you heard from the numbers, even in presence of a complex supply chain for \u2013 particularly for glass, globally, which reduced the ability to get to the maximum potential in this moment to fully fulfill demand. So more to come also because the supply constraints will abate over time gradually. So we have now \u2013 our hair care business is also in the double-digit growth, which is the other engines that we are activating in our effort to balance the growth across the different engines. And the launch in China of Aveda has been a big step of this, but also there is growth in the West, very strongly in our hair care business. The other interesting indication is the makeup. Makeup globally, except the lowdown\u2019s situations in China and the travel retail issues that we have described. But wherever there is market reopening, makeup is doing very well, and it\u2019s continued the recovery. As I said, with M\u00b7A\u00b7C performance at the center, which make us very, very happy, because that\u2019s a very important step forward. And then we have extraordinary skin care innovation pipeline. Admittedly, the majority of it will come in quarter three and in quarter four, but we will continue on our strong innovation in skin care. And then when you look at distribution globally, there are many good news of expanded productive distribution. So the Douyin start in China is very, very promising, and this reflects also in a promising start of 11/11. The distribution in the North America specialty-multi is becoming more and more productive, and we are expanding the productive part of it. In the next year, we will continue this expansion. And there is also the important concept of expanding our brands in new countries, which technically is new distribution of our brands to new consumers. And obviously, Aveda in China is the big, but it\u2019s not the only one. And in quarter three and quarter two, we \u2013 quarter four, sorry, we will continue with these expansions. So just a few examples to give you the sense that we are strong, by category, strong in hair care, strong in fragrances, strong in makeup wherever there is reopening and so strong in the future in the market that will reopen in the future. And in skin care, the large majority of the issue that we are in country is linked to the lockdown and very strong innovation plan to restart growth there. So we remain very confident on the long-term growth. Proof of that, last point, is that in the second semester, if you look to our outlook, we are assuming to go back in total in the semester to double-digit growth, but obviously, as we explained gradually in quarter three and then more stronger in quarter four. Tracey?\nTracey Travis: Yes. And so Dara, obviously, what\u2019s impacting us at the beginning of this year are significant unanticipated impacts to the business starting in the third and fourth quarter of last year and continuing into the first quarter with disruptions as it relates to some of the lockdowns and key parts of our business. As we think forward and for the outlook that we\u2019ve provided today, we are expecting some easing, as Fabrizio said, in the second half of the year. And in the fourth quarter, we are expecting further easing. As we think about the construct of the business heading forward and assuming more stabilization of some of these matters, our business is intact in terms of the leverage that we can get, the margin expansion that we can get and the growth that we can get as well. As Fabrizio said, consumer demand is strong. It has been disrupted. We are mindful, as everyone else of, is \u2013 that there could be recessionary pressures in some of our key markets, and we are taking that into account. But the flexibility that we\u2019ve created in our cost structure over the last few years remains intact and certainly positions us well in the future once there is more stabilization in the macro environment for continued strong top line growth and also continued strong margin expansion and EPS growth.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question will come from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nChris Carey: Hi, good morning.\nTracey Travis: Good morning.\nChris Carey: So I\u2019m sure China recovery will get plenty of focus on the call today. So perhaps I\u2019ll just actually take a bit more of a medium, longer-term angle here. Fabrizio, can you just comment on the willingness of the Est\u00e9e Lauder organization to take some of your brands beyond historical channels or types of interactions with retailers? I think you called out the specialty-multi expansion in the U.S. Clearly, in China, you\u2019ve expanded with JD and China TikTok. It feels like the organization is certainly becoming more comfortable working with different kinds of channels. And I wonder, just in the context of a broader recovery, and certainly, there is going to be a big debate on what is the true earnings power of this organization, I wonder if you can just comment on whether this is true, this concept of sort of expanded comfort with new opportunities and whether you see additional opportunities ahead and where those might be.\nFabrizio Freda: Yes. No, I think we\u2019ve been very much focused on having the right level of distribution and focus where the consumer preferences is \u2013 are evolving over the last years. We operate in 12 channels now versus basically one-channels 15 years ago. And so this comfort is there, and you can see this, first of all, in our online expansion that continues to be \u2013 we have obviously our brand.com that continue to be expanded to more brands, to better sites, to more services in the sites. You have our 3PP, meaning the Tmall model, which is expanding around the world. Also Alibaba is present in different countries and we are collaborating with them in expanding the model in different countries, Lazada being probably the most evident example at this point to this expansion. We are playing with pure-play more and more, and we have many examples, particularly in Europe of this. And obviously, our retail.com continued to be expanded. And then in terms of our comfort with specialty-multi, I believe this is not new. We are very comfortable, and there is \u2013 with specialty-multi, we are doing well. We are growing. We have increased our market shares in the channel as well, in North America, but not only in North America, in many other parts of the world and this is progressing very, very well. The other important news in this sense is direct-to-consumers. So, our freestanding stores had a tremendous quarter. And we see the model of freestanding store coming back really strongly wherever there is a reopening and wherever the consumers are really enthusiastic to go back to the brick-and-mortar. And today, our freestanding stores are more efficient and more effective for the many efforts of cost management and the expertise in retail we brought in the company in the last years. So, the return of traffic to freestanding stores is very promising. Just to give an example, our freestanding stores in the U.S. for fragrance brands, we are plus 33% in the quarter. So, very, very strong sign of remaking. And so we will \u2013 the expansion, you said \u2013 you spoke about JD, but I spoke about the win, exactly the Chinese TikTok. And this is a more recent expansion. And the interesting thing is not only we are more comfortable with playing in these channels, but we are winning when we play in these channels. Look at what happened in JD where we \u2013 when we enter, we entered really, really well with a great partnership, great results. So, we are definitely continue to manage our distribution in line with consumer preference with the evolution of where the consumers we serve go. However, we will keep in mind that our distribution has to be with high-touch services. It has to be a distribution, which serve the consumer not only with availability of product and pricing, that serve the consumer with our education, customization, care services. And they are focused on building brand equity, building experiences. And they are focusing on building the unique elements of luxury. We are a pure play in luxury. So, it\u2019s not only about distributing wherever there is mass of consumers. It\u2019s about distributing with quality, branding and services. And so that focus has not changed, but we have become better in creating these environments in where \u2013 in places where there is more and more consumer traffic. Tracey, do you want to add anything?\nOperator: Thank you. The next question will be from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nSteve Powers: Great. Thank you and good morning. Maybe following up on Dara\u2019s question. Your comments were helpful, both for Fabrizio and Tracey. But is there a rate of overall consumption or retail sales growth that you anticipate across your portfolio in the year, just that we can compare to the flat to 2% positive organic growth that you have assumed in your outlook? That\u2019s the question \u2013 kind of follow-up. And then I guess I would also, if possible, like a little bit more context around the retailer destocking that you have called out broadly, but particularly in the U.S. as it\u2019s not something I think \u2013 I don\u2019t think we have heard that from your peers, but certainly a dynamic we have seen across other categories. But so far, beauty hasn\u2019t been a focal point for that. So, just again, a bit more detail on what you have seen, how much you think maybe specific to your portfolio and what the outlook is through the holidays into the second half? Thank you.\nTracey Travis: So, let me start on retail. It\u2019s hard to do an average retail across all of our markets, as you might well imagine. I would tell you that in all of our markets, as we look at the projection for the year, retail is positive. It varies by market, but obviously, given some of the disruptions and slowness in certain markets, but it\u2019s positive in every market. In some markets, it\u2019s actually double digit positive. And so again, the gap between retail and net in many of our markets, certainly in our recovery markets, is not very big at all. In markets where we have had more disruption or we have the anticipation of a slowdown, that\u2019s where we are seeing some more of the disconnect between retail and net.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question will be from Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead.\nDana Telsey: Good afternoon. Good morning. It feels like afternoon already. Good morning everyone. As you think about what was embedded in your prior guidance in terms of pricing, is there any change that you are making in any of the categories of pricing that you are looking at? And then in the U.S., are you seeing any difference, whether it\u2019s your freestanding, whether it\u2019s specialty-multi or department stores, is there a difference in performance? And how you are thinking about inventory going forward? Thank you.\nTracey Travis: So, I will start with the pricing. We are looking at \u2013 so there is no change in terms of the pricing that we took at the beginning of the year. We talked about pricing at about 5.5% on average across our markets, and that was taken in the July-August timeframe. We also anticipated in the prior guidance a secondary price increase, and we are looking at that in light of some of the inflation pressures and looking at taking slightly more pricing in certain markets, not across all markets. And that would be in the January-February timeframe. As it relates to our channels, channels that have had lower traffic are the ones that we are most focused on in terms of, obviously, slowing our shipments to those channels, so they don\u2019t end up over stock, so we can bring down some of the stock levels in those channels. So, we talked about if you just think about the first quarter, we called out the channels that performed strongly for us in the first quarter. So, our specialty-multi channel performed strongly in our first quarter. Online in China performed strongly in our first quarter. So, those are the channels that continue to perform strongly for us. Other channels, we are a bit more cautious. Freestanding stores performed strongly for us in the first quarter. And we expect in recovery markets that freestanding stores will continue to perform well. So, we will continue, obviously, to supply our freestanding store network. Where both ourselves as well as our retailers are a little bit more cautious on some of the traffic trends that are being anticipated, we are being a bit more cautious in terms of how we supply those retailers.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question will be from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nBryan Spillane: Hi. Good morning. Thank you, operator. Tracey, maybe just a follow-up on the pricing and inflation question. Can you just give us a little bit more detail on some of the sources of inflation and what\u2019s been incremental, I guess since the start of the fiscal year? And maybe a little bit of an expectation as you see it today is, you continue to see that rising. Is that going to be a factor as we go into fiscal \u201824? Just trying to get a sense of how we should be thinking about continued inflation as we go through the balance of the year?\nTracey Travis: Yes. I think we certainly have seen quite a bit of inflation in our supply chain, particularly as it relates to transport. We do see that continuing in parts of our supply chain. In other parts, we actually see it moderating. We have seen wage inflation as well. And again, that has been incorporated in some of the pricing that we have anticipated this year. We have seen advertising rates stabilize a bit. And so we are not seeing as much media inflation as we were seeing previously. So, those are, I would say, the biggest areas of inflation that we are watching. But the supply chain area is one that is a particular focus for us going forward. And again, we \u2013 one of the great things about our category, we do have pricing power, and so we have certainly exercised that where we see the inflationary impacts.\nFabrizio Freda: And I just want to add that we continue to remain what we \u2013 the same point of view we expressed in the last quarter, which is we are in a position to offset most of the inflations with pricing, and we are doing that. The other thing, however, which is emerge stronger in this last quarter is the currency. So, the dollar has become even stronger. And so now we are also looking with the next consideration and possible price increases in January-February to see if in selective markets where there is also a big pressure of currency, not only of inflation, we can also make some selective adjustments in these areas. But our goal to remain to offset most of the price \u2013 most of the inflation we are pricing. And then the rest, we are doing things like, for example, our innovation has been higher price on average and focused well on protecting gross margin, our cost savings. And mainly of our cost activity are contributing to covering the overall impact of inflations. So, we believe we are and we will be in good shape in that sense.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question will be from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nRupesh Parikh: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, in China, I was curious if you can just give some additional color in terms of what you are seeing on the ground today in both the Mainland and the Hainan corridor. And as you think about the China recovery, do you essentially assume a return to more normal conditions by Q4? Is that the way to think about it?\nFabrizio Freda: Yes. In China, our assumption, as I said before, is that there will be a gradual recovery from the restrictions. And with the gradual recovery with the restriction, we will see increased traffic in Hainan and in the brick-and-mortar in domestic China. So, those are the two key things that needs to evolve, because retail growth overall is positive, and it\u2019s interesting that retail growth overall is stronger than the economy, the way the economy is being communicated. So, the phenomenon that is historically proven that beauty prestige industry grows on average more than the economy, and then we grow on average more than the beauty industry is \u2013 that trend is what we believe will continue to happen in the future. And it\u2019s happening as we speak. However, the traffic movements are very different. And again, to clarify what, I think the prepared remarks should have clarified in detail, but take the Hainan situation. Hainan traffic \u2013 the last time, Hainan traffic was, if you want, regular, was January, February, last January, February, where it was full normal traffic. Then after the first lockdown, went down 80%. And then in July, recovered and went to minus 30%. And there was the assumption that this roughly over time would continue to go well. But then on the contrary, now is \u2013 in October, was still minus 70 again. So, basically, it\u2019s the expectation of future traffic that make the inventories presence too high for that level of traffic and need to be readjusted. And the second factor is that traffic at minus 70 is obviously much less than what originally was expected and also in terms of consumption. But on the other side, there is more consumption online. There is more growth online. There is people that are going through channels. So, in total, we have seen as I said before, a mid-single digit growth even in this traffic situation with reduced traffic levels. So, when the traffic will recover in brick-and-mortar, both in travel and in domestic, when this will happen, the retail should further improve, further increase and be pretty positive. And we do assume that this phenomenon will be more visible in our quarter four. So, in the April-June period is when we assume there will be a rebuild of traffic. And that between now and then, as we explained, will be \u2013 we don\u2019t see a lot of improvements in quarter two, but we then see a start of gradual improvement also in quarter three. That\u2019s the dynamic we are seeing.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question will be from Jason English from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJason English: Hey. Good morning folks. Thank you. I am going to rapid fire a couple of questions. First, to put a fine point on the answer to that last question, the exit rate for the year, are you assuming that Hainan is like back to bright running at normal traffic, down 30, down 50, if you can clarify that, I guess sequential improvement, but to what level is still uncertain? Second question, is Europe the next shoe to drop like in terms of destocking? And then lastly, you have multiyear plans. I am not asking for multiyear guidance. But as you think about like what you thought your earnings power may be in fiscal \u201824 and fiscal \u201825, how has that changed in light of all the dynamics that you are discussing today? Thank you.\nTracey Travis: So, let me start, Jason. In terms of Hainan, no, we don\u2019t anticipate that Hainan will be fully back to normal in Q4. Much improved, but not fully back to normal. And so we are now looking at fiscal \u201824 for traffic to recover. And again, it\u2019s a guesstimate at this point in time. So, the recovery, obviously, has been slower than I think all of us have anticipated, but we do know that there is a commitment by the retailers in Hainan and certainly the area in general to get back to fantastic growth. They just opened a new mall. So, it is still an exciting travel destination, and we look forward to the recovery. But it is not fully recovered in our Q4 thoughts right now, more fiscal \u201824. In terms of Europe, Europe, as we said in our prepared remarks, is recovering. And so we have seen strong growth in Europe, particularly in emerging markets in Europe. We are seeing makeup recover. We are seeing strong fragrance growth. And the one category that has been a bit slower really in all of our markets has been skin care, but we have got strong innovation in the second half of the year and certainly into fiscal \u201824 that we believe will accelerate our skin care growth. But right now, we do not believe that there are any reasons to be concerned about Europe. Obviously, everyone has been talking about a European recession. But I think as many have talked about, and we would say the same, we are not seeing it yet. So, that\u2019s Europe. As it relates to fiscal \u201824, when you think about this year, really the biggest \u2013 one of the biggest impacts we have had outside of the disruptions in terms of travel retail has been currency. And so our fiscal \u201824 is dependent on in terms of what we thought before will be impacted by what happens with currency. And one of the things that we talked about as well in the prepared remarks, some of our currency impact is adjusted out in our constant currency results and guidance. And some of it is not as it relates to travel retail in particular. And that\u2019s a big amount. So, as you are looking at our margins and the significant impact on our margins, currency is an impact on our margins. So, depending on what happens with currency rates, that influences our outlook for fiscal \u201824. But most importantly, Jason, as it relates to the fundamental health of our business, once these disruptions are behind us, we still are \u2013 feel very strong about, obviously, the strategies that we executed throughout the last couple of years, this temporary impact, and how we have prepared the business for future growth. We are opening new production and R&D facility in Asia that will reduce some of the transport issues, or by the way, it will reduce some of the currency issues as well. And so there are many things that we have done over the last few years that have really strengthened our business once we emerge from the disruption that has been extended unfortunately this year, and our teams are managing through with fantastic resiliency. And we are, as Fabrizio indicated, incredibly proud of all of them and what they have been doing to support the business.\nEnd of Q&A:\nOperator: Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Fabrizio Freda",
            "content": "Thank you, Rainey and hello to everyone. It is good to be with you today. Since we spoke in mid-August, the headwinds of COVID-19 restrictions in China, high inflation globally and a strong U.S. dollar intensified significantly. Amid the increased complexity, we delivered organic sales, down 5%, in line with our outlook and adjusted diluted EPS higher than expected. Even in these conditions, our multiple engines of growth strategy empower us to seize prevailing growth opportunities. Indeed, we realized outstanding performance in many developed and emerging markets around the world to partially offset the impact of COVID-19 restrictions in Asia travel retail and domestic China as well as tighter inventory management by some retailers in the U.S. To reflect this prolonged and heightened external pressure, we are reducing our outlook for fiscal year 2023, most notably for the second quarter. While Tracey will discuss our revised outlook in detail, there are three primary drivers. The first is the impact of ongoing COVID-19 restriction in Asia travel retail, particularly Hainan. The restrictions are leading to a slower return of tourism versus what retailers had anticipated, resulting in tightening of inventories. While it is significant, this near-term temporary pause does not diminish our deep conviction in Hainan for the long-term as it is among the best brand-building destination for new consumers' acquisition. The second driver is the tightening of inventory by some retailers in the U.S. And the third is the far stronger U.S. dollar. Encouragingly, beyond these headwinds, consumer demand is robust in markets which are emerging from the pandemic, evidenced in the underlying fundamentals of our first quarter results and retail sales growth. Our optimism in the long-term growth opportunities for our brands and for prestige beauty is intact. During fiscal year 2023, we plan to continue investing in our brands, including for innovation, advertising, strategic entry into new countries and expanded consumer reach to grow profitable prestige beauty share. We expect a gradual sequential improvement to low double-digit organic sales growth and high-teens adjusted EPS growth on a reported basis in the second half of fiscal year 2023. As these pressures begin to abate, the momentum in other areas of our business builds and our ongoing investments drive growth. Let me now share some insights from our first quarter. As while we had headwinds, we also had many bright spots that give us confidence in the second half and beyond. We realized double-digit organic sales growth in many large developed and emerging markets around the world. Japan and the UK grew strongly, alongside Brazil, India, the Middle East and Thailand, to name just a few. Brick-and-mortar prospered in these markets as we welcome consumers with high-touch services, engaging activations and newness. Domestic China delivered sequentially improving organic sales trends of down single-digits driven by excellent growth online, a better performance in brick-and-mortar. Our luxury brand, La Mer and Tom Ford Beauty, contributed to online growth as did Aveda and Bobbi Brown, among others. We are very encouraged by the terrific results of our expanded consumer reach on JD and Douyin. From a retail sales perspective in the online channel, we grew nearly twice as fast as prestige beauty in China to gain share. In the U.S., our freestanding store accelerated, benefiting from both enhanced omnichannel capabilities and greater demand for our high-touch services, be it artistry at M\u00b7A\u00b7C or personalization at Jo Malone London and Le Labo. Specialty-multi also performed especially well, powered by traditional stores and enhanced by the partnership of Ulta Beauty at Target and Sephora at Kohl's. Clinique, M\u00b7A\u00b7C and Bobbi Brown led growth. Given excellent results in Ulta Beauty over the last year, M\u00b7A\u00b7C and Bobbi Brown are further expanding their presence. We continue to see promise in the U.S., evidenced in its overall retail sales growth in prestige beauty despite the recession risk and the strong performance our brands delivered in freestanding stores and specialty-multi. We remain committed to investing in innovation, advertising and granular consumer acquisition strategies as we aim to best capture the market growth opportunities. Looking at brands globally. 13 brands rose organically, collectively increasing high single-digit to represent over half of our organic sales. Among the 13, M\u00b7A\u00b7C excelled in makeup, La Mer in luxury skin care, Jo Malone London in fragrance and Aveda in hair care, while The Ordinary, our newest brand, appeal to consumers with its authenticity and innovative approach to ingredient transparency. Fragrance sales rose an outstanding 18% organically and expanded in every region. Tom Ford Beauty, Jo Malone London, Le Labo, KILIAN Paris and Editions de Parfums Fre\u0301de\u0301ric Malle all contributed, driven by sought-after innovation and heroes as our luxury and artisanal portfolio evolves from strength to strength. For example, Jo Malone London's momentum continued with gains balanced across the regions. Innovation served as a catalyst for growth. In China, the new Night Collection resonated beautifully as did the limited edition Brit Collection. Globally, the brand brilliantly leveraged its hero strategy, creatively reimagining the power of English Pear & Freesia in a campaign to recruit new consumers. Demand for fragrance was even stronger as ongoing supply issues of glass and componentry constraints this still excellent sales growth. Profitability for fragrance improved despite the significant currency headwinds, further evidence of the benefits derived from our strategic pivot to the higher end of the category. Hair care double-digit organic sales growth was fueled by increasingly diverse growth engines. We were thrilled to launch Aveda in Mainland China, marking our entry in prestige hair care in the market. In the U.S., Bumble and bumble realized gains from strong results in Ulta Beauty at Target and expansions into Macy's. In skin care, while the Este\u0301e Lauder, Dr. Jart and Origins brands were most pressured by reduced retail traffic and travel in China, several brands still prospered. La Mer, Bobbi Brown and The Ordinary grew organically driven by coveted heroes and newness to showcase the gains to be had from entry prestige through luxury. Innovation also resonated strongly in skin care, which bodes well for the future when these transitory pressures abate. In China, Este\u0301e Lauder luxury oriented Re-Nutriv was highly sought-after and the launch of Re-Nutriv Ultimate Diamond transformative brilliant serum boosted overall demand for the franchise. Clinique Smart Clinical Repair gained momentum in China and also in the U.S. as its new moisturizer complemented the regimens popular serum and eye cream, which launched last year. The Clinique Smart franchise benefit from its 360-degree marketing campaign of these three products, featuring powerful scientific credentials and claims. Makeup renaissance was evident as markets both reopened and evolved in recovery. The category growth in emerging market was especially striking a broad-based from Latin America to the Middle East, India and Southeast Asia, while makeup also grew in most developed markets in Western Europe, along with Japan and Korea. M\u00b7A\u00b7C had a remarkable quarter, fueling passion for makeup around the world, growing high single-digits organically. Consumer embraced its unparalleled artistry and the brand's innovation proved captivating, especially Powder Kiss Velvet Blur Slim Stick for the lipstick finish and elevated packaging as well as M\u00b7A\u00b7CStack mascara. M\u00b7A\u00b7C's creative marketing activations further contributed to growth. In Southeast Asia and Latin America, the brands TikTok challenges realized standout results, driving significant new consumer acquisition on Lazada's Super Brand Day, a strong double-digit volume growth across Latin America as over 400 content creators contributed to the campaign. Before I close, I am also pleased to share that today we will release our fiscal year 2022 social impact and sustainability report. It features exciting progress, made possible by the extraordinary efforts of our employees around the world across our ESG areas of focus and previously stated goals. The report also details new goals for electric vehicles, water reduction and responsible sourcing. Finally, on the last few earnings calls, I discussed actions we were taking to make more progress in our commitment to racial equity as well as women advancement and gender equality, which are also reflected in the report. In conclusion, the current external pressures are many. However, as we look ahead, we remain confident in our focus on advancing our long-term growth strategy, further balancing and diversifying our multiple engines and fully leveraging the long-term promise of prestige beauty. We aim for fiscal year 2023 to be another year of progress on our strategy despite the headwinds. In the first quarter alone, we set the stage to expand our luxury portfolio, having announced a deal to create Balmain Beauty with the couture fashion house. We extended our consumer reach in productive distribution in high-growth channels to match success across regions and continue to strategically expand brands into new countries with Aveda launch in domestic China. We also welcome colleagues into our new China innovation labs in Shanghai, amplifying our ability to best create for the Chinese consumer. And we began limited production for skin care in our new manufacturing facility near Tokyo. I would like to close with my deepest thanks to our employees for their exceptional commitment amid the complexity of the environment. Your creativity, wisdom and passion are beyond compare. Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to Tracey. Good morning, Dara. Yes. It's a complex question, so there is a lot to say. I will start, and then Tracey will join me in \u2013 particularly in the second part of your question. So we are very confident in our retail trend globally and the growth of our business even in this very difficult external complex times. So just to give you an example of this, in North America, our retail was growing in the quarter, mid-single digits. And I could \u2013 I can explain later all the many things, which are going well in this direction. But for example, it's a quarter where our M\u00b7A\u00b7C brand really demonstrated it is back to growth, with a 22% growth. And for our North America business, to see M\u00b7A\u00b7C retail coming back so strongly is great news because as you know, Clinique and M\u00b7A\u00b7C are a big part of the growth potential of our North America particularly business. So, great news to have M\u00b7A\u00b7C back into growing and market share growing brands in our top brands portfolio. Then when you look at China and you look at Chinese consumers combined, what was the retail in travel retail and the retail in Mainland, in domestic business, we grew mid-single digits, the retail, despite the inventories tightening issues that we have explained in the prepared remarks and in the press release. So there is an underlying strength. Then when you look, for example, to the China domestic recovery from the difficult moment of the Shanghai closure where we couldn't ship for some time, and we have spoken in the last quarter to the fact that we will be gradually recovering, this \u2013 now the brick-and-mortar remained with less traffic, but we gradually improve the trend. And the decline has been still a decline, but less \u2013 much less than in the previous quarter. And online, where there was no issue of restrictions, we're growing above the market, double than the market, growing again market share in online in China. Then we spoke about the fact that we are very encouraged in general by the extraordinary progress in the fragrance business. Now we have taken the strategic decision to focus on the luxury of seasonal fragrances, and they are growing. They are profitable. And they are growing more than double digit, you heard from the numbers, even in presence of a complex supply chain for \u2013 particularly for glass, globally, which reduced the ability to get to the maximum potential in this moment to fully fulfill demand. So more to come also because the supply constraints will abate over time gradually. So we have now \u2013 our hair care business is also in the double-digit growth, which is the other engines that we are activating in our effort to balance the growth across the different engines. And the launch in China of Aveda has been a big step of this, but also there is growth in the West, very strongly in our hair care business. The other interesting indication is the makeup. Makeup globally, except the lowdown's situations in China and the travel retail issues that we have described. But wherever there is market reopening, makeup is doing very well, and it's continued the recovery. As I said, with M\u00b7A\u00b7C performance at the center, which make us very, very happy, because that's a very important step forward. And then we have extraordinary skin care innovation pipeline. Admittedly, the majority of it will come in quarter three and in quarter four, but we will continue on our strong innovation in skin care. And then when you look at distribution globally, there are many good news of expanded productive distribution. So the Douyin start in China is very, very promising, and this reflects also in a promising start of 11/11. The distribution in the North America specialty-multi is becoming more and more productive, and we are expanding the productive part of it. In the next year, we will continue this expansion. And there is also the important concept of expanding our brands in new countries, which technically is new distribution of our brands to new consumers. And obviously, Aveda in China is the big, but it's not the only one. And in quarter three and quarter two, we \u2013 quarter four, sorry, we will continue with these expansions. So just a few examples to give you the sense that we are strong, by category, strong in hair care, strong in fragrances, strong in makeup wherever there is reopening and so strong in the future in the market that will reopen in the future. And in skin care, the large majority of the issue that we are in country is linked to the lockdown and very strong innovation plan to restart growth there. So we remain very confident on the long-term growth. Proof of that, last point, is that in the second semester, if you look to our outlook, we are assuming to go back in total in the semester to double-digit growth, but obviously, as we explained gradually in quarter three and then more stronger in quarter four. Tracey? Yes. No, I think we've been very much focused on having the right level of distribution and focus where the consumer preferences is \u2013 are evolving over the last years. We operate in 12 channels now versus basically one-channels 15 years ago. And so this comfort is there, and you can see this, first of all, in our online expansion that continues to be \u2013 we have obviously our brand.com that continue to be expanded to more brands, to better sites, to more services in the sites. You have our 3PP, meaning the Tmall model, which is expanding around the world. Also Alibaba is present in different countries and we are collaborating with them in expanding the model in different countries, Lazada being probably the most evident example at this point to this expansion. We are playing with pure-play more and more, and we have many examples, particularly in Europe of this. And obviously, our retail.com continued to be expanded. And then in terms of our comfort with specialty-multi, I believe this is not new. We are very comfortable, and there is \u2013 with specialty-multi, we are doing well. We are growing. We have increased our market shares in the channel as well, in North America, but not only in North America, in many other parts of the world and this is progressing very, very well. The other important news in this sense is direct-to-consumers. So, our freestanding stores had a tremendous quarter. And we see the model of freestanding store coming back really strongly wherever there is a reopening and wherever the consumers are really enthusiastic to go back to the brick-and-mortar. And today, our freestanding stores are more efficient and more effective for the many efforts of cost management and the expertise in retail we brought in the company in the last years. So, the return of traffic to freestanding stores is very promising. Just to give an example, our freestanding stores in the U.S. for fragrance brands, we are plus 33% in the quarter. So, very, very strong sign of remaking. And so we will \u2013 the expansion, you said \u2013 you spoke about JD, but I spoke about the win, exactly the Chinese TikTok. And this is a more recent expansion. And the interesting thing is not only we are more comfortable with playing in these channels, but we are winning when we play in these channels. Look at what happened in JD where we \u2013 when we enter, we entered really, really well with a great partnership, great results. So, we are definitely continue to manage our distribution in line with consumer preference with the evolution of where the consumers we serve go. However, we will keep in mind that our distribution has to be with high-touch services. It has to be a distribution, which serve the consumer not only with availability of product and pricing, that serve the consumer with our education, customization, care services. And they are focused on building brand equity, building experiences. And they are focusing on building the unique elements of luxury. We are a pure play in luxury. So, it's not only about distributing wherever there is mass of consumers. It's about distributing with quality, branding and services. And so that focus has not changed, but we have become better in creating these environments in where \u2013 in places where there is more and more consumer traffic. Tracey, do you want to add anything? And I just want to add that we continue to remain what we \u2013 the same point of view we expressed in the last quarter, which is we are in a position to offset most of the inflations with pricing, and we are doing that. The other thing, however, which is emerge stronger in this last quarter is the currency. So, the dollar has become even stronger. And so now we are also looking with the next consideration and possible price increases in January-February to see if in selective markets where there is also a big pressure of currency, not only of inflation, we can also make some selective adjustments in these areas. But our goal to remain to offset most of the price \u2013 most of the inflation we are pricing. And then the rest, we are doing things like, for example, our innovation has been higher price on average and focused well on protecting gross margin, our cost savings. And mainly of our cost activity are contributing to covering the overall impact of inflations. So, we believe we are and we will be in good shape in that sense. Yes. In China, our assumption, as I said before, is that there will be a gradual recovery from the restrictions. And with the gradual recovery with the restriction, we will see increased traffic in Hainan and in the brick-and-mortar in domestic China. So, those are the two key things that needs to evolve, because retail growth overall is positive, and it's interesting that retail growth overall is stronger than the economy, the way the economy is being communicated. So, the phenomenon that is historically proven that beauty prestige industry grows on average more than the economy, and then we grow on average more than the beauty industry is \u2013 that trend is what we believe will continue to happen in the future. And it's happening as we speak. However, the traffic movements are very different. And again, to clarify what, I think the prepared remarks should have clarified in detail, but take the Hainan situation. Hainan traffic \u2013 the last time, Hainan traffic was, if you want, regular, was January, February, last January, February, where it was full normal traffic. Then after the first lockdown, went down 80%. And then in July, recovered and went to minus 30%. And there was the assumption that this roughly over time would continue to go well. But then on the contrary, now is \u2013 in October, was still minus 70 again. So, basically, it's the expectation of future traffic that make the inventories presence too high for that level of traffic and need to be readjusted. And the second factor is that traffic at minus 70 is obviously much less than what originally was expected and also in terms of consumption. But on the other side, there is more consumption online. There is more growth online. There is people that are going through channels. So, in total, we have seen as I said before, a mid-single digit growth even in this traffic situation with reduced traffic levels. So, when the traffic will recover in brick-and-mortar, both in travel and in domestic, when this will happen, the retail should further improve, further increase and be pretty positive. And we do assume that this phenomenon will be more visible in our quarter four. So, in the April-June period is when we assume there will be a rebuild of traffic. And that between now and then, as we explained, will be \u2013 we don't see a lot of improvements in quarter two, but we then see a start of gradual improvement also in quarter three. That's the dynamic we are seeing."

            "name": "Tracey Travis",
            "content": "Thank you, Fabrizio and hello everyone. Our first quarter organic net sales declined 5% and earnings per share, was $1.37. Net sales were in line with our expectations and earnings per share exceeded them even with incremental headwinds in the quarter. While sales overall met expectations, our mix of sales was different than we expected. In August, our outlook anticipated that first quarter sales would be negatively impacted by continued COVID restrictions in China and Hainan, with gradual improvement throughout the first half of the fiscal year as the restrictions lifted. However, the impact on our first quarter sales was greater than we anticipated in Hainan as stores were closed for most of the quarter. And as they reopen, traffic remained quite modest, which resulted in lower shipments due to the anticipation of a slower pace of recovery. Our outlook also reflected the comparison to the prior year in the U.S. when certain of our retailers secured shipments earlier for holiday due to supply chains and concerns in stark contrast to the tightening of inventory by retailers this year due to concerns about slower traffic. Our actual results for the quarter reflect even tighter-than-expected inventory management with certain retailers in the U.S. These additional headwinds were somewhat offset by a faster pace of recovery in other parts of Asia-Pacific and in EMEA as well as the benefit of strategic pricing actions we took in July and August. From a geographic standpoint, organic net sales in the Americas declined 3%, reflecting the timing of shipments in the prior year as well as the tightening of inventory this year. The timing of shipments in the U.S. contributed 6 percentage points to the overall region's prior year growth. In Latin America, nearly all markets grew double-digits, fueled primarily by the strong recovery of makeup. In our Europe, the Middle East and Africa region, organic net sales declined 5%, primarily due to continued challenges in travel retail and APAC, including the negative impact from foreign currency transactions in key international travel retail locations of 2%. Our global travel retail business declined as the ongoing COVID restrictions in China curtailed travel to Hainan. Stores there were closed for most of the quarter and traffic has been slow to return, resulting in lower shipments as we support stricter inventory management with certain retailers. Conversely, travel retail sales in European markets and in the Americas rose triple and double-digits respectively boosted by increasing resumption of professional and personal travel. Net sales in the United Kingdom increased with double-digit growth from The Ordinary. Elsewhere in EMEA, the lifting of COVID restrictions and the return of tourism in the region drove growth in many markets led by India, the Middle East and Turkey and resulted in double-digit growth in brick-and-mortar. Organic net sales in our Asia-Pacific region fell 7% due to the ongoing COVID restrictions impacting brick-and-mortar sales in Greater China and travel retail in Korea. In Korea, double-digit growth from nearly all brands was more than offset by the decline from Dr. Jart's travel retail business. The rest of the region delivered strong net sales growth led by Thailand, Malaysia and Japan. Many markets in the region continued to recover as restrictions lifted and traffic returned to stores. From a category perspective, fragrance led growth, with organic net sales rising 18%. Strong consumer demand for our brands and innovation drove growth. Our luxury and artisanal brands continue to thrive led by Tom Ford Beauty, Jo Malone London and Le Labo. Net sales from Clinique rose strong double-digits, winning across all regions with the Clinique Happy product franchise. Our hair care net sales rose 11% organically. Aveda led category growth driven by double-digit growth in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, from hero products and strong innovation, including the launch of the Color Control product line. Organic net sales in makeup declined 6% driven by the COVID restrictions in China as well as a difficult comparison to the prior year period due to the timing of shipments for holiday in the U.S. Net sales rose strong double-digits in Southeast Asia and in the emerging markets of EMEA due to strong performance from M\u00b7A\u00b7C, Bobbi Brown and Este\u0301e Lauder. M\u00b7A\u00b7C continues to be an overall top performer driven by the success of both hero products and strong innovation across the foundation, lips and eye subcategories. Organic net sales in skin care declined 11%. This category has been the most impacted by the COVID restrictions in Hainan, where skin care accounts for a majority of our business. Our gross margin declined 190 basis points compared to the first quarter last year. The positive impacts from strategic pricing were more than offset by higher costs due to promotional items and inflationary pressures in our supply chain. Operating expenses increased 250 basis points as a percent of sales driven by the reduction in sales. Operating income declined 29% to $668 million, and our operating margin contracted 440 basis points to 17% in the quarter. Diluted EPS of $1.37 decreased 28% compared to the prior year, slightly better than expected as a result of effective cost management. The impacts from foreign currency transactions in key travel retail locations and the exit of certain designer licenses negatively impacted diluted EPS by 4% and 3%, respectively. During the quarter, we utilized $650 million in net cash flows from operating activities, reflecting increased working capital, primarily due to the timing of payments and higher inventory levels as well as lower net income. We invested $152 million in capital expenditures for supply chain improvements, online capabilities and distribution expansion. We returned $325 million in cash to stockholders through both dividends and share repurchases. And additionally, this morning, we announced a 10% increase in our quarterly dividend. So again, we delivered our overall quarter one results as we anticipated. Now let's turn to our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2023. While we believe the headwinds that impacted our first quarter results are largely temporary, it is also apparent that both the timing and speed of the stabilization of inflation and recovery from both the pandemic and currency challenges are uncertain. As retailers in Hainan were prepared for a faster recovery of traffic to the island with their inventory levels of our products, we have further modified our shipments to be more in line with the slower retail environment. And although we expect the adjustment to inventory by certain of our retailers corresponding with potentially lower traffic, to continue into the second quarter, particularly in Hainan, we believe this adjustment will subside in the second half as COVID restrictions ease and consumers begin to travel with less safety restrictions in China. Until that happens, ongoing restrictions are expected to result in lower net sales in these areas. We also anticipate the tighter inventory management in the U.S. to abate in the second half given the still strong demand for our products at retail. We expect the remainder of our first half performance to be pressured as we navigate through these uncertainties. Despite the headwinds to net sales, we remain confident in the strength of our business strategy and expect to sustain our investments to drive long-term profitable growth. We plan to continue to invest in the areas of advertising, innovation, production capacity, consumer engagement as well as new consumer reach and continued strategic entry into new countries for some of our brands. For the second half, we anticipate trends to improve sequentially as restrictions are lifted, travel throughout Greater China, including Hainan, progressively resumes and the tightening of inventory subsides in Asia travel retail and in the U.S. We expect continued recovery in various markets in EMEA and Asia/Pacific for the balance of the year. Currency is also projected to be a significant drag on our reported results in the second quarter and for the full year as the U.S. dollar has continued to rapidly strengthen against key currencies. As we entered fiscal 2023, we took strategic pricing to mitigate higher-than-normal inflation. Both the magnitude and speed of currency movements experienced thus far, combined with inflation, have further suppressed our expectations for the balance of the year. Specifically, based on mid-October spot rates of 0.978 for the euro, 1.122 for the pound, 7.29 for the Chinese yuan and 14.36 for the Korean won, currency translation is anticipated to continue to negatively impact reported sales and diluted EPS growth for the second quarter and for the full year. We expect organic sales for our second quarter to fall 11% to 9%, primarily reflecting the continued risk of disruption in Hainan, leading to further tightening of inventory and continued tightening of inventory by certain retailers in the U.S. Currency translation is expected to be dilutive to reported net sales by 7 points with an additional 2 points due to the impact of certain foreign currency transactions in key international travel locations. The impact of sales from certain designer license exits are expected to dilute reported growth by approximately 1 point. We expect second quarter adjusted EPS of $1.19 to $1.29 forward, a decline between 60% to 57%. Currency translation is expected to be dilutive to EPS by $0.20 such that constant currency adjusted EPS is expected to decline between 54% and 50%. This includes the negative impact from certain foreign currency transactions in key international travel retail locations of approximately 7 percentage points. For the full year, we expect organic sales growth to range from flat to up 2%. Currency translation is expected to dilute reported sales growth for the full fiscal year by 6 percentage points, and we expect an additional 2 points of dilution from the impact of certain foreign currency transactions in key international travel retail locations. The impacts of returns associated with restructuring and other activities and sales from certain designer license exits are each expected to dilute reported growth by approximately 1 point. We expect full year operating margin to be approximately 16.1%, up 360 basis point contraction from the prior year period, primarily due to the geographical mix of sales, foreign currency impacts and the strategic investments I previously mentioned. We now expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 25%, reflecting the change in our estimated geographical mix of earnings and less benefit from excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $5.25 and $5.40 before restructuring and other charges. This includes approximately $0.44 of dilution from currency translation. In constant currency, we expect EPS to fall between 21% to 19%, which includes a negative impact from foreign currency transactions and key international travel retail locations of approximately 10 percentage points. In closing, we remain confident about the long-term prospects for global prestige beauty and in our multiple engines of growth strategy. Despite the temporary external challenges, we plan to continue to invest selectively in strategic priority areas to support the ongoing growth of our amazing brands now and into the future and to gain profitable share globally. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will be happy to take your questions at this time. Yes. And so Dara, obviously, what's impacting us at the beginning of this year are significant unanticipated impacts to the business starting in the third and fourth quarter of last year and continuing into the first quarter with disruptions as it relates to some of the lockdowns and key parts of our business. As we think forward and for the outlook that we've provided today, we are expecting some easing, as Fabrizio said, in the second half of the year. And in the fourth quarter, we are expecting further easing. As we think about the construct of the business heading forward and assuming more stabilization of some of these matters, our business is intact in terms of the leverage that we can get, the margin expansion that we can get and the growth that we can get as well. As Fabrizio said, consumer demand is strong. It has been disrupted. We are mindful, as everyone else of, is \u2013 that there could be recessionary pressures in some of our key markets, and we are taking that into account. But the flexibility that we've created in our cost structure over the last few years remains intact and certainly positions us well in the future once there is more stabilization in the macro environment for continued strong top line growth and also continued strong margin expansion and EPS growth. Good morning. So, let me start on retail. It's hard to do an average retail across all of our markets, as you might well imagine. I would tell you that in all of our markets, as we look at the projection for the year, retail is positive. It varies by market, but obviously, given some of the disruptions and slowness in certain markets, but it's positive in every market. In some markets, it's actually double digit positive. And so again, the gap between retail and net in many of our markets, certainly in our recovery markets, is not very big at all. In markets where we have had more disruption or we have the anticipation of a slowdown, that's where we are seeing some more of the disconnect between retail and net. So, I will start with the pricing. We are looking at \u2013 so there is no change in terms of the pricing that we took at the beginning of the year. We talked about pricing at about 5.5% on average across our markets, and that was taken in the July-August timeframe. We also anticipated in the prior guidance a secondary price increase, and we are looking at that in light of some of the inflation pressures and looking at taking slightly more pricing in certain markets, not across all markets. And that would be in the January-February timeframe. As it relates to our channels, channels that have had lower traffic are the ones that we are most focused on in terms of, obviously, slowing our shipments to those channels, so they don't end up over stock, so we can bring down some of the stock levels in those channels. So, we talked about if you just think about the first quarter, we called out the channels that performed strongly for us in the first quarter. So, our specialty-multi channel performed strongly in our first quarter. Online in China performed strongly in our first quarter. So, those are the channels that continue to perform strongly for us. Other channels, we are a bit more cautious. Freestanding stores performed strongly for us in the first quarter. And we expect in recovery markets that freestanding stores will continue to perform well. So, we will continue, obviously, to supply our freestanding store network. Where both ourselves as well as our retailers are a little bit more cautious on some of the traffic trends that are being anticipated, we are being a bit more cautious in terms of how we supply those retailers. Yes. I think we certainly have seen quite a bit of inflation in our supply chain, particularly as it relates to transport. We do see that continuing in parts of our supply chain. In other parts, we actually see it moderating. We have seen wage inflation as well. And again, that has been incorporated in some of the pricing that we have anticipated this year. We have seen advertising rates stabilize a bit. And so we are not seeing as much media inflation as we were seeing previously. So, those are, I would say, the biggest areas of inflation that we are watching. But the supply chain area is one that is a particular focus for us going forward. And again, we \u2013 one of the great things about our category, we do have pricing power, and so we have certainly exercised that where we see the inflationary impacts. So, let me start, Jason. In terms of Hainan, no, we don't anticipate that Hainan will be fully back to normal in Q4. Much improved, but not fully back to normal. And so we are now looking at fiscal \u201824 for traffic to recover. And again, it's a guesstimate at this point in time. So, the recovery, obviously, has been slower than I think all of us have anticipated, but we do know that there is a commitment by the retailers in Hainan and certainly the area in general to get back to fantastic growth. They just opened a new mall. So, it is still an exciting travel destination, and we look forward to the recovery. But it is not fully recovered in our Q4 thoughts right now, more fiscal \u201824. In terms of Europe, Europe, as we said in our prepared remarks, is recovering. And so we have seen strong growth in Europe, particularly in emerging markets in Europe. We are seeing makeup recover. We are seeing strong fragrance growth. And the one category that has been a bit slower really in all of our markets has been skin care, but we have got strong innovation in the second half of the year and certainly into fiscal \u201824 that we believe will accelerate our skin care growth. But right now, we do not believe that there are any reasons to be concerned about Europe. Obviously, everyone has been talking about a European recession. But I think as many have talked about, and we would say the same, we are not seeing it yet. So, that's Europe. As it relates to fiscal \u201824, when you think about this year, really the biggest \u2013 one of the biggest impacts we have had outside of the disruptions in terms of travel retail has been currency. And so our fiscal \u201824 is dependent on in terms of what we thought before will be impacted by what happens with currency. And one of the things that we talked about as well in the prepared remarks, some of our currency impact is adjusted out in our constant currency results and guidance. And some of it is not as it relates to travel retail in particular. And that's a big amount. So, as you are looking at our margins and the significant impact on our margins, currency is an impact on our margins. So, depending on what happens with currency rates, that influences our outlook for fiscal \u201824. But most importantly, Jason, as it relates to the fundamental health of our business, once these disruptions are behind us, we still are \u2013 feel very strong about, obviously, the strategies that we executed throughout the last couple of years, this temporary impact, and how we have prepared the business for future growth. We are opening new production and R&D facility in Asia that will reduce some of the transport issues, or by the way, it will reduce some of the currency issues as well. And so there are many things that we have done over the last few years that have really strengthened our business once we emerge from the disruption that has been extended unfortunately this year, and our teams are managing through with fantastic resiliency. And we are, as Fabrizio indicated, incredibly proud of all of them and what they have been doing to support the business."

For opening remarks and introductions, I\u2019d like to turn the floor over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Rainey Mancini. Ma'am, you may begin.\nRainey Mancini: Hello. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our report filed with the SEC where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges and adjustments disclosed in our press release. Unless otherwise stated, all organic net sales growth also excludes the non-comparable impacts of acquisitions, divestitures, brand closures, and the impact of foreign currency translation. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures on our press release and on the investors section of our website. As a reminder, references to online sales include sales we make directly to our consumers through our brand.com sites and through third-party platforms. It also includes estimated sales of our products through our retailers' websites. Throughout our discussion, our Profit Recovery and Growth Plan will be referred to as our PRGP. During the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question, so we can respond to all of you within the time scheduled for this call. And now, I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio.\nFabrizio Freda: Thank you, Rain, and hello to everyone. Today, we will review our results for fiscal year 2024, which represented a difficult year for the company and discuss the implementation of our strategy reset to drive improving performance in fiscal year 2025 and beyond. After a challenging first half, we returned to top line growth in the second half of fiscal year 2024 with organic sales growth accelerating from 6% in the third quarter to 8% in the fourth quarter. And we delivered an adjusted operating margin of 11.6%. This level of profitability was higher than the first half and expanded from the second half of fiscal year 2023. All told, for fiscal year 2024, our organic sales declined 2%, we achieved modest gross margin expansion and adjusted operating margin contracted 120 basis points to 10.2%. These results were in line with the revised outlook we offered in May for sales and better than expected for operating profitability despite the further softening of the prestige beauty industry in China and Asia travel retail. That said, we remain unsatisfied with this performance. Looking ahead, our fiscal year 2025 outlook reflects continued declines in the prestige beauty industry in China and Asia travel retail. While the PRGP, which remains on track relatively to our previously stated goals, enable us to offset the pressure to profitability from declines in areas of our business that have high penetration of skin care, it yields a slower pace of operating margin expansions for fiscal year 2025 than we had previously expected when we expanded the PRGP in February. For fiscal year 2025, in the rest of our global business, we are planning to deliver improved performance across both developed and emerging markets. To fuel this, our strategic priorities are reigniting skin care, capitalizing on the multiple growth drivers of high-end fragrance, moving faster in leveraging winning channels, launching accretive innovation inclusive of new, big opportunities and enhancing our precision marketing capabilities for increased effectiveness and efficiency of our consumer facing investments. The PRGP enables and accelerates these strategy priorities and is the foundation to restore sustainable long-term organic sales growth and to rebuild our operating profitability. We are also creating a faster and leaner organization that will more quickly adapt to market dynamics and be better able to leverage future growth. While our sales and profit outlook for fiscal year 2025 is disappointing, this year we will make important strides as we implement our strategy reset to continue rebalancing regional growth, deliver improved annual profitability, strengthen go-to-market and innovation capabilities to elevate our execution in response to a more competitive market. These efforts will position us to both outperform the prestige beauty industry in fiscal year 2026 and accelerate profitability expansion. Let me now describe the drivers of our fiscal year 2025 outlook before discussing our strategic priorities in greater detail. The prestige beauty industry reported retail sales trends in mainland China, further weakening sequentially in the fourth quarter from a decline of mid-single-digit in the third quarter to a decrease of low double-digits. As the consumer confidence remains subdued, importantly, we gained share in the prestige beauty industry in mainland China in the fourth quarter, driven by La Mer and Estee Lauder progress in the market's far largest category of skin care. Retail sales trend for the prestige beauty industry in Asia travel retail also did not improve during the fourth quarter. This was most notable in Hainan, where retail sales in the beauty market declined over 40% despite a more favorable comparison to the previous period as the quarter unfolded. For Hainan and Asia travel retail overall, as traffic returns, conversion levels remained subdued and significantly lower than pre-pandemic levels owing to weak consumer sentiment reducing basket sizes, and to an extent, consumer diversity spending to experiences. The US prestige beauty industry retail sales growth accelerated each month throughout the fourth quarter, albeit with growth at a still compelling pace of mid-to-high single digits. Encouragingly, our company retail sales returned to growth. While we continue to see the prestige beauty share driven by the extent of our exposure to slower growth channels, our share loss was reduced in the fourth quarter. This reflects gains from gradually increasing our exposure to high growth channels like Amazon and specialty-multi. And this trend was further reinforced in July when our company retail sales growth accelerated to mid-single-digits driven by double digit growth in fragrance and hair care. Moreover, the company retail sales improved to mid-single-digit growth in skin care and we gained share in the category in July. For fiscal year 2025, we forecast the global prestige beauty industry to grow 2% to 3%, reflecting ongoing strengths in many developed and emerging markets globally. The market in the west, which collectively exited fiscal year 2024 relatively strongly, are primed to drive the industry performance. The markets in the east in total are expected to be tempered as strengths in Japan and Southeast Asia is offset by ongoing declines in mainland China and Asia travel retail. We expect the global prestige beauty industry to reaccelerate to historical mid-single-digit growth in fiscal year 2026, assuming China progressively stabilizes and then returns to growth. With this industry landscape and given the size of our business in some areas most challenged, our fiscal year 2025 organic sales growth outlook range is in a decline of 1% to an increase of 2%. Our organic sales growth outlook reflects an acceleration in several areas of business, partially offset by declines in mainland China and Asia travel detail. For our first quarter, the pressure is more acute, such that our organic sales outlook calls for a decline which Tracey will describe in further detail. For fiscal year 2025, we are refocusing consumer facing investment on the biggest opportunity, streamlining our organization to be faster and more agile in order to fuel the organic sales growth momentum we have in many areas of our business across developed and emerging markets. We also intend to better leverage the strengths of our brands in North America where we are leaders in prestige makeup, which is the region's biggest category and where we hold the top two ranked brands. And in prestige skincare, adding four of the top five ranked brands. Moreover, in North America, we also intend to leverage the market strengths across generations as we focus a balanced contribution to industry growth by age. Looking at our strategic priorities for fiscal year 2025, let me begin with skin care, which represents over 50% of our sales and is our most profitable product category. Our initiatives are designed to enable us to even better leverage our top ranked global prestige skin care portfolio to welcome new consumers and further engage our loyal consumers through elevated precision marketing, a robust accretive innovation pipeline and expanded reach in high growth channels. This starts with The Ordinary, which entered fiscal year 2025 with momentum, having growth in its organic sales by more than 20% in fiscal year 2024. The Ordinary is leading the way among our brands in capitalizing on white spaces opportunity in products, channels, and geographies. In the fourth quarter, The Ordinary launched its first product in lip care, executed a hugely successful TikTok Shop Super Brand Day campaign in the US and established its footprint in Japan. For fiscal year 2025, The Ordinary has already newly entered the body care subcategory and is preparing to expand into more emerging markets given its proven successful launches in India, the Middle East and South Africa over the last two years. Among the brands we are incubating, a star in fiscal year 2024 was NIOD in skincare. The brand has a promising future. Clinique is making great strides, executing its strategy to double down on its authentic dermatologist heritage. Clinique begun this work in the US and UK this past spring and has been expanding its global rollout. This includes its successful launch on the US Amazon Premium Beauty store in March. Impressively, Clinique has returned to share growth in the US prestige skincare with three consecutive months of gains through July. Clinique performance in US retail in July was particularly impressive, with the brand\u2019s skincare brand and makeup outperforming across subcategories and Clinique retaking the number one rank in overall prestige beauty. La Mer, along with Estee Lauder and Re-Nutriv franchise, [indiscernible] our luxury skincare strategy. With both brands poised to build on their successful in -- of fiscal year 2024 during which La Mer exceptional growth made it our best performing brand. For Re-Nutriv, we plan to build upon this fiscal year 2024 the launches of the new moisturizer and serum foundation this year through an expanded product portfolio focused on the science of skin longevity and visible age reversal. With The Ordinary, Clinique, Estee Lauder and La Mer, we are bringing to market in fiscal year 2025 a rich innovation pipeline focused on the benefits of nighttime skincare ritual, which is an incremental use education. Our brand portfolio strategically addresses various skin concerns and types with targeted ingredients and claims designed to appeal to a diverse range of consumer segments because of price and product position. Let me now turn to our next strategic priority, capitalizing on the multiple growth drivers of high-end fragrances where our luxury and artisanal portfolio of Jo Malone London, TOM FORD, Le Labo, KILIAN PARIS, Frederic Malle and AERIN Beauty collectively rose mid-single-digit organically in fiscal year 2024. The luxury tier of the fragrance category where we are number one ranked was the best performing tier in retail sales in fiscal year 2024 and we expect this to be the case again in fiscal year 2025. We are focused on further realizing the growth potential of high-end fragrances, given its broad based trends around the world to drive greater scale for the company. From Le Labo\u2019s outstanding performance in fiscal year 2024 led by Asia Pacific where its organic sales nearly doubled, to Jo Malone London's disruptive campaign with Tom Hardy to drive its men's business and we are well positioned to build on our momentum. Our brands have distribution expansion and compelling newness slated not only in the scent but also in the form and size to trade consumer into the luxury tier and we are thrilled to be expanding our luxury portfolio with the September launch of the Balmain Beauty brand which chose the fragrance category to begin its journey. We are also focused on driving accelerated sales growth in the prestige tier of the fragrance category with our Estee Lauder and Clinique brands with broad rich go-to-market activation slated for this and upcoming quarters. Let me turn our strategic priority of winning in fast growing channels globally. To do so, our mindset has shifted to more boldly merchandising our brands where consumers are increasingly discovering the shopping for beauty while executing with excellence and staying true to our high touch approach. While this encompasses both brick-and-mortar and online, today I will share with you examples from online. In the US, our launches of Clinique, Too Faced, and Bumble and bumble, on the Amazon Premium Beauty store in the second house epitomized this philosophy. Clinique launched with a skin analysis tool in March, and by June, had expanded to offer live chat with the Clinique ambassador while Bumble and bumble launched with extensive hair education from the brand\u2019s expert stylists. All three brands are off to a very strong start on the US Amazon Premium Beauty store. Clinique and, Bumble and bumble, are seeing promising uptake also with male consumers. And for Clinique, where we now have a full quarter of performance, we are encouraged by the extent of consumers subscribing for future purchases as well as the strong level of repeat purchases in the quarter. So far, in fiscal year 2025, Dr.Jart+, Smashbox and Lab Series have already opened storefronts in the US, and we have more launches on the horizon. Around the world, we are building growth momentum with social commerce, driving new consumer acquisition by engaging consumers where they're spending their time, leveraging a content-focused approach with live streaming and short-form videos and activating full funnel integration of social media and commerce. In China, we have scaled and sustained strong growth on the win with more brand launches later for fiscal year '25. Looking at Japan and Korea, we are further unlocking platform opportunities for our brand with [Line and Rakuten] (ph), and accelerating social commerce on Kakao with focus on gifting. Our final strategic initiative is enhancing our precision marketing capabilities, enabling us to be more focused on new consumer acquisition. From brand equity to product assortment, distribution and media, we are better able to target new consumers and also to accelerate the effectiveness of acquisition and efficiency spend. This capability has been designed to leverage data, including over 200 million consumers profiles we have built over the years and exclusive partnerships with AI leaders. Precision marketing is also allowing us to be far more nimble with trend to action. During fiscal year 2024, we began pilot studying in market around the world to marry trends with our rich portfolio of existing products and innovation to activate against trends with speed. We realized promising results, including successes with the peach makeup and bronzing trends. We have now formalized this process and developed the trend AI tool to enable our brand teams around the world to quickly drive trends to action. In closing, we have designed our strategy reset to position the company for a stronger future. We are wholly focused on executing with excellence across these strategic initiatives and our PRGP to again realize the proven performance of our company. To our employees, I extend my deep gratitude for your commitment amid a challenging time for our company. And now, I will turn the call over to Tracey.\nTracey Travis: Thank you, Fabrizio, and hello, everyone. We navigated through another challenging year across several areas of our business and took specific actions to more sustainably improve our sales and profit results as it became apparent that the recovery that was anticipated to occur throughout the year in some of our markets was impacted by far more volatility. And while we returned to growth in the second half, primarily driven by resumed shipments in Asia travel retail, we are certainly not pleased with our overall full year results, and on top of global prestige volatility, the execution of our strategy has not met our expectations in some key areas of our business. During the year, we also largely completed the basic design and began the implementation of our multiyear PRGP to deliver stronger results against our expectation or a more gradual rebuilding of sales growth along with an acceleration in profitability. Before I discuss our fiscal 2025 outlook, let me first share with you the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter and full year results. Our fourth quarter organic net sales increased by 8% compared to last year, meeting our expectations, albeit with a different geographical mix than we anticipated, which reflected lower results in mainland China and North America due notably to further softening in overall prestige beauty in both of these markets. A combination of tentative consumer sentiment in China and consumer inflationary pressures in North America are believed to have contributed to the deceleration in both markets. Diluted EPS rose to $0.64 from $0.07 last year, exceeding our expectations, largely due to our operating performance and the reduction in our full year effective tax rate. From a geographic standpoint, organic net sales rose 32% in EMEA, primarily driven by the increase in our Asia travel retail business, given the favorable comparison to the prior year period as shipments increased over last year's extremely low level. In addition, organic net sales increased in both our developed European and priority emerging markets. Organic net sales in Asia Pacific decreased 4%, primarily driven by the ongoing softness in overall prestige beauty in mainland China as well as lower shipments in Hong Kong SAR as we anniversaried the initial surge in sales with the border reopening in the prior year period. Outside of these markets, net sales rose strong double-digits in Japan as a favorable currency, coupled with strong in-market activation and expanded consumer reach attracted both domestic and traveling consumers and bolstered growth across all product categories in nearly all channels of distribution. In the Americas, organic net sales decreased 5% driven by the decline in North America, reflecting the ongoing intensely competitive environment as well as an overall slowdown in growth in prestige beauty, especially in brick-and-mortar channels, which particularly impacted our skin care makeup categories. Online sales grew mid-single-digits in the region, benefiting from both retailer.com growth and the launch of select brands, specialty Clinique on the US Amazon Premium Beauty store. From a product category perspective, skincare organic net sales increased 15%, primarily due to the increased shipments within the Asia travel retail business referenced earlier, which drove net sales growth from both La Mer and Estee Lauder. Organic net sales from The Ordinary also increased across all geographic regions. Makeup organic net sales increased 1%. Net sales increased from Estee Lauder, benefiting from the resumption of shipments in our Asia travel retail business and the continued global success of the Double Wear product franchise. Clinique net sales rose strong double-digits, fueled by the Almost lipstick product franchise. Partially offsetting these increases were declines from M\u00b7A\u00b7C and TOM FORD. Organic net sales increased 2% in hair care and 1% in fragrance. Regarding fragrance, net sales growth was driven by the ongoing consumer appeal of Le Labo's unique product offerings and targeted expanded consumer reach and Jo Malone, partially offset by declines in Estee Lauder and Clinique. Our gross margin expanded 380 basis points to 71.8% compared to last year. This increase primarily reflected lower obsolescence and overhead charges as well as higher skincare sales. Operating expenses decreased 340 basis points as a percent of sales to 62.7%, driven largely by the increase in net sales, improved gross margin and lower general and administrative expenses. During the quarter, we recorded $471 million of impairment charges related to Dr.Jart+ given the continued lower-than-expected growth and profitability of the brand. We made the decision to exit the brand from its heavily discounted travel retail channel and prioritize direct investments in other more profitable areas of the business, including in mainland China and Western markets where a broader assortment of the brand has been resonating well with consumers. Operating income increased to $349 million and our operating margin expanded 700 basis points to 9% in the quarter. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.8% compared to a negative 17.9% last year, the latter having had a larger year-end true-up to reflect our final effective tax rate for the fiscal year of 2023. Our rate was better than anticipated this year, primarily due to the shift in our geographical mix of earnings. Diluted EPS increased to $0.64 from $0.07 last year due largely to the improvement in our operating results, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from the increase in our effective tax rate. Foreign currency translation was $0.03 dilutive to EPS in the quarter and the impact from the business disruptions in Israel and other parts of the Middle East was $0.02 dilutive. Turning now to our full year results. Although we saw growth in the second half, our full year results highlight both volatility and the impact of our own challenges in some key areas of our business. Collectively, the pressure in Mainland China from the ongoing softness in overall prestige beauty, the necessary actions we took in Asia travel retail during the first half of the year to reduce high trade inventory levels in a prolonged soft retail environment, and continued pressure from the competitive environment, particularly in North America, outweighed the solid growth we saw during the year in our EMEA and LatAm markets. Organic net sales decreased 2%, primarily due to the ongoing softness in overall prestige beauty in mainland China, leading to a 3% decline in Asia Pacific. The challenges in Asia travel retail also pressured sales, resulting in a 2% decline in EMEA as our return to growth in Asia travel retail in the second half was not enough to offset the first half decline due in part to retail trends decelerating throughout the second half in China. Net sales in the Americas was overall flat compared to last year. From a category perspective, skincare net sales declined 3%, largely due to the declines in mainland China and Asia travel retail and makeup decreased 1%, also reflecting these challenges as well as a prior year benefit from changes made to M\u00b7A\u00b7C's take-back loyalty program. Net sales fell 4% in hair care and rose 2% in fragrance. Confronted with the volatility throughout the year, just discussed, our teams attempted to balance cost efficiency actions with consumer-facing investments to support growth. Net sales with our specialty multi-retailers and in our freestanding stores, each grew double digits. Global travel retail represented 19% of our reported sales in fiscal 2024 and online net sales represented 28%. Our gross margin improved 30 basis points to 71.7% compared to 71.4% last year, reflecting the initiatives we took throughout the year to reduce excess and obsolete inventory as well as changes in brand mix. Partially offsetting this progress was an unfavorable impact from foreign currency and the impact from the under-absorption of overhead in our plants due to the necessary pull down of production earlier in the year. Operating expenses increased 160 basis points to 61.5% of sales, reflecting deleverage from the sales decline, including our investments to support targeted expanded consumer reach globally and to support growth where we had momentum. Operating income declined 13% to $1.6 billion from $1.8 billion last year, and our operating margin contracted 120 basis points to 10.2% for the full year. Our effective tax rate for the year was 31% compared to 26.5% last year, reflecting a higher effective tax rate on our foreign operations due to the geographical mix of our earnings and the unfavorable impact associated with previously issued stock-based compensation. Net earnings was $935 million and diluted EPS was $2.59, both declining 25% compared to last year. Foreign currency translation was $0.10 dilutive to EPS and the impact from the business disruptions in Israel and other parts of the Middle East was $0.06 dilutive. We generated $2.4 billion in net cash flows from operating activities compared to $1.7 billion last year. The increase reflects improvements in working capital, which was largely due to the actions we took to reduce in-house inventory levels. We utilized $919 million for capital investments and returned $947 million in cash to stockholders through dividends. After our initial minority investment in DECIEM in 2017 and then increasing our investment to become a majority owner in 2021, we are pleased to have completed, subject to finalization of the purchase price, our acquisition of the remaining equity interest in DECIEM this past May for $859 million, of which $829 million was paid as of June 30, 2024. Looking ahead now to our outlook for fiscal 2025. While acknowledging some initial bright spots related to pivots in our strategy, we are cognizant that overall global prestige beauty growth has tempered in recent months as reflected in the current declines in mainland China and Asia travel retail, particularly Hainan. Prestige beauty has also moderated in some of our major markets like North America. And while we believe we have the right priorities for growth, we are also mindful of the level of variability that continues to exist in many of our markets. Accordingly, we are reflecting a more subdued recovery of growth in fiscal 2025, which you have seen in this morning's press release. The PRGP remains a critical element in our ability to deliver margin expansion and ultimately is designed to put in place the cost structure necessary for the company to drive stronger leverage in its business on lower than our normal growth expectations this year. This should also yield even greater flow-through of benefits to profit as net sales progressively return to higher growth in future years. In fiscal 2024, we had already approved actions to begin addressing overcapacity in parts of our supply chain, inclusive of streamlining manufacturing and distribution costs where we could react more quickly and to simplify certain areas of our overhead structure. Our PRGP initiatives are focused on three primary benefit areas for the company, first, accelerating margin expansion through both gross margin recovery and additional expense leverage while also enabling additional cash generation for the company. Second, creating additional fuel for growth with targeted investments in consumer-facing activities. And third, simplifying our processes and creating more agility and speed in execution. We have begun executing against many initiatives within these three areas of benefit for the company. Regarding margin expansion, the significant pull down of production we did at the beginning of last year to bring manufacturing levels well below our shipment trends in order to reduce our inventory level has already yielded cash benefits in fiscal 2024. This has also resulted in additional benefits from reduced discounts and obsolescence costs and lower levels of expenses are expected to continue into fiscal 2025. Additionally, this year, we are planning to realize greater net benefits from our strategic pricing actions through less discounts and promotions with our enhanced focus on precision marketing. These actions, along with the benefits of more accretive innovation, particularly in skincare, support the gross margin expansion we expect this year. Additionally, regarding expense leverage, with our expectation of a slower return to growth, there is increased leverage pressure from our fixed costs. We are executing against our restructuring program and have already approved initiatives to reduce spans and layers in certain parts of our business. Furthermore, we are expanding our existing shared services capabilities to support the simplification and standardization of key processes and scale capabilities faster, as well as rationalizing the breadth of distribution choices across our existing portfolio of brands. We have also negotiated savings across many of our spending areas and are already realizing savings in areas like transportation. Lastly, we are taking this opportunity of the PRGP to address some of the ways we work to simplify decision-making and enhance our agility and go-to-market execution to be faster in this ever-changing dynamic global prestige beauty environment. More to come on this in a future earnings call. Also, we anticipate at this point that approximately 80% of the net benefits realized from the PRGP in fiscal 2025 are targeted to improve gross profit, with the remaining 20% targeted to reduce certain operating expenses. This mix is likely to shift in fiscal 2026 as more of our expense actions contribute favorably to our overall expense structure, given the expected cadence of initiatives. We also expect to take restructuring and other charges of at least approximately $100 million to $120 million in fiscal 2025 from approved initiatives with additional charges expected during the course of the year as more initiatives are finalized and approved. However, with modest sales growth expected in fiscal 2025, as I indicated before, we will unfortunately also experience a greater amount of fixed expense de-leverage in addition to the unfavorable mix pressure from softer sales performance in some of our higher-margin categories and regions. And as we communicated, we are protecting a portion of the savings we generate from the PRGP to reinvest selectively in advertising and store activation to fuel growth with the brands and regions where we have momentum, and support the growth we are currently experiencing with active derm, luxury fragrance and distribution expansion in faster growth channels. We began this fiscal year with our team fully immersed and committed to executing initiatives across all pillars of the PRGP now that we are post the completion of our design phase. We continue to expect to deliver approximately $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion of incremental operating profit from the full PRGP. And while we are focused on realizing slightly more than half of the net benefits in 2025, additional savings initiatives may be required as lower sales volumes are realized. Overall, we expect to progress margin expansion at an accelerated pace as a result of the plan by delivering annual margin expansion greater than our pre-pandemic historical average, inclusive of creating additional fuel to accelerate sales growth at a faster pace as well. Accordingly, fiscal 2025 is projected to be a year of transition for the company, navigating continued macroeconomic softness and challenges in a few key areas of our business, while accelerating growth where we have momentum and executing against our real -- and realizing anticipated benefits from the PRGP. Our strategic imperatives for the year, as mentioned by Fabrizio, are focused on leveraging the inherent strengths we have across our brands, categories, regions and talented employees. Over the next few years, Western markets, along with Asia Pacific markets outside of China, are expected to drive a greater portion of our long-term profitable growth as we deepen our focus on fast-growing channels in these markets. We have the opportunity to leverage our skincare brands with strong lux and active derm appeal, expand the consumer reach of our luxury fragrance portfolio, capture more relevant trends with our makeup brands and reenergize our hair care brands, all with an eye towards capturing additional consumers while retaining loyal ones. We also plan to begin leveraging our regional lines manufacturing and distribution network in Asia to create greater inventory agility as demand dictates. With that backdrop in mind and using August 12 spot rates of 1.092 for the euro, 1.276 for the pound, 7.167 for the Chinese yuan, and [1,364] (ph) for the Korean won and full fiscal year organic net sales are forecasted to range between a decrease of 1% and an increase of 2%. Throughout this past fiscal year, to mitigate the expected pressures to our business, we accelerated the implementation of initiatives under our PRGP as I previously mentioned, which we expect, combined with our sales growth range to result in most of our margin expansion for the full year to be realized in gross margin. We expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 32%. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $2.75 and $2.95 before restructuring and other charges. This includes approximately $0.03 of dilution from currency translation. In constant currency, we expect EPS to grow by approximately 7% to 15%. Net cash flows from operating activities are forecasted between $1.8 billion and $2 billion. Capital expenditures are planned at approximately 5% to 5.5% of forecasted net sales. We expect our first quarter results to be pressured by the ongoing challenges in mainland China and Asia travel retail we experienced as we exited fiscal 2024, mainly as subdued consumer sentiment, more experiential spending and lower conversion rates continue. We are, however, seeing some early signs of progress, particularly in North America, as Fabrizio mentioned, with our strategic pivots and assuming the progressive return of prestige beauty sales growth in mainland China and Asia travel retail, we anticipate overall improvement over the course of the year. With that backdrop for our first quarter, we currently expect organic net sales to fall 3% to 5%. At this time, we expect first quarter diluted EPS of $0.02 to $0.10 before restructuring and other charges. This includes approximately $0.01 of accretion from currency translation. In constant currency, we expect EPS of $0.01 to $0.09. Assuming a full year global prestige beauty performance in fiscal year 2025 of 2% to 3%, our remaining three quarters are anticipated to meet or slightly exceed this growth which is in line with our previous sales performance objective of exceeding the overall average of global prestige beauty growth by at least 1 point. With the implementation of our PRGP initiatives and if global prestige beauty accelerates further in fiscal 2026, the combination of additional sales momentum and margin accretion leverage from our PRGP should provide further progress toward returning to a more sustainable sales and profit growth algorithm. In closing, while our fiscal 2024 performance was disappointing. We remain focused on navigating the current volatile global prestige beauty dynamics, while leveraging the long-term strengths of our brands, and we maintain confidence in our strategic pivots and the execution of our PRGP to drive profitable growth in fiscal 2025 and beyond. I want to personally thank our teams globally for their resilience, commitment and dedication to the company through another difficult year. Before I turn the call back over to Fabrizio for a few final comments, as most of you know, I announced my planned retirement at the end of this fiscal year. Accordingly, I want to congratulate Akhil Srivastava on his appointment as CFO effective November 1. I look forward to working with him over this transition period and appreciate his commitment to the company and its ongoing success. And now, I'll turn it back to Fabrizio.\nFabrizio Freda: Thank you, Tracey. And I want to make a final comment before we turn to Q&A. Today, I announced my intention to retire from Estee Lauder companies. It has been a privilege, a great honor to lead the company for 16 years, I have been deeply enriched by exceptional colleagues around the world, and I take this decision to retire with gratitude for all we have accomplished. I have two primary objectives ahead of my retirement. First, I intend to execute with excellent strategy reset that the Tracey and I described today, inclusive of our profit recovery and growth plan. It is important to me that our next leader inherits a business with momentum. Second, I plan to work closely with our Board of Directors and my successor, once named, to ensure a smooth transition. My passion for our beautiful company is as strong as ever, and I'm confident in its bright future. Throughout the years, I've deeply enjoyed representing the company with analysts and investors. I look forward to our continued engagement until I retire. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.\nSteve Powers: Great. Thank you so much. There's a lot to cover. But, Fabrizio, maybe we can pick up where you left off, as you -- both you and Tracey both outlined a very challenging and transformational time for the company. As you personally look ahead at the priorities facing Estee Lauder, how are you thinking about -- or how would you frame the most important attributes that you'd look for in your successor? And how closely will you be involved over the coming months and quarters finding that successor.\nFabrizio Freda: Sure. As I said in the prepared remarks, I will be very involved with the Board in working on the succession. And obviously, as you know, it's the Board responsibility to decide the successor, but we are working all together to get the best output out of the work done for some time. This is a long-term process. It's not something that we are just starting working now, obviously. And in terms of the characteristic of the successor, I think the successor has to be obviously a great leader and understand the key elements of our company. And one of the key elements is being brand builders and people that can develop growth. We are a growth company, and we are a global company. And so obviously, being able to drive growth globally and being able to continue reshaping the cost structure of the company in the proper way that will become even more leverageable with future growth, are going to be essential characteristics. But I would just want to reassure you that the options that the Board has developed, they all have these characteristics. So as I said, the Board is pretty well advanced in the work needed to determine the future.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.\nBryan Spillane: Hi, thanks, operator. And good morning, everyone. So maybe just to kind of try to put this year, fiscal '25, into a little bit of a perspective, maybe Tracey, can you give us a sense of if China hadn't decelerated like it has since you last reported, what would earnings power have been this year? Or maybe to put it a different way, how much -- in terms of your forecast this year and the change in trend in China, like, how much do you think that actually affected earnings power in fiscal '25?\nTracey Travis: Yeah. No, thanks, Bryan, for the question. So clearly, China and travel retail are important growth drivers for the company, have been historically and they're also high-margin areas of the company as well. So, when we see pressure in those areas as we saw in fiscal 2024, you can see what the impact on the company is. So if, right now, in our guidance, Mainland China is expected to be anywhere between flat to down high single-digits and travel retail Asia is expected to be down double-digit, that puts quite a bit of pressure on our earnings results and our EPS. The fact that this year, with those two pressures, we actually will have EPS up is really because of the contribution of the profit and recovery growth plan, the PRGP, which we will refer to it from now on, as we said in the prepared remarks. So that is delivering -- if you think about delivering around 51% at the low end of the range given the fact that we're relatively flat if you take the midpoint of our range in terms of our growth this year what we're expecting. So that means other markets like the Americas, APAC outside of China and EMEA outside of travel retail are expected to grow. But if you take that contribution, it is being offset by some expense deleverage. It's also in looking at your models, you need to add back some of the interest expense from our debt that we took out for the acquisition of TOM FORD in DECIEM and bonus as well back at target levels. So those are some of the differences. And then obviously, you heard our estimates for currency, which will be slightly dilutive for the year. So all of that puts pressure on our overall EPS. But still on a year that is close to what it was last year from a sales performance perspective, we are demonstrating improved margins and improved EPS. And that is because of -- and with a negative mix impact related to travel retail in China and that is because of both the PRGP as well as other actions the company has taken to really halt a lot of activities that we would normally do in the course of the year. We are also, importantly, as I said in our prepared remarks, protecting some investment for the momentum that we spoke about in the prepared remarks, in categories like fragrance, the active derm category and where we're seeing momentum. That will be important for us when we think forward to fiscal '26 and beyond and have more market growth, hopefully, but also those brands continuing to become a greater proportion of the business.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.\nLauren Lieberman: Great, thanks. Good morning. I\u2019m pausing, I had to frame my seven questions. So I wanted to just follow on, Tracey, maybe on the -- what you've just shared and the driver, the fact that there will be earnings growth even with sales flat to down. And you called out halting some activities, protecting some investment, noting all the expense deleverage that there will be, how should I -- why shouldn't I be concerned that there's going to be constraining investments this year because the market doesn't stand still, right? You mentioned North America more competitive. I'm going to guess other companies, whether they are global or local across China, are not going to be pulling back on investment. Everyone is going to want to be gaining share in a market that's down. So how do we know that there isn't too little investment being put back in '25 in the name of putting up some earnings growth? And then frankly, when we get to this time next year and there's new leadership in place or has been named and you have the strategic reset but there isn't another strategic reset. So I threw a lot in there, but those are the things that are in my mind that I'd love to hear both of you comment on. Thanks.\nTracey Travis: No. Of course, Lauren. So, if you think about when we first described the PRGP, we said we have gross savings, and we are investing some of those gross savings in order to fund the program as well as fuel some of -- create fuel for some of our consumer-facing investments. And so when you think about the cadence of results and savings that we expect from the program, obviously, first quarter, there is some benefit, but that will progressively improve through the course of the year as our actions materialize. So, we are funding some of the consumer-facing investments out of the gross investments in our -- out of our PRGP. I also mentioned that even in fiscal '24, where we had green shoots, you heard, I mean, many of those strategies were put in place before, obviously, some of the innovation that we came out with and some of the plans that we had to expand in faster-growing channels. So we have tried to, in a very difficult year, even in fiscal '24, protect some of the consumer-facing investments. And as we see growth happening in certain areas, we will certainly fund more of it in some of the savings generated throughout the course of this year in the PRGP.\nFabrizio Freda: And also, Lauren, I wanted to add a concept here, which is, my intention also announcing the retirement at the end of the fiscal year is also to work together with the Board, together with the team and when announced together with my successor on making sure that we put in 2025, the company in a condition to leverage growth momentum in general, in all the areas where the opportunity will be in the China market where today we see declines to continue to grow market share, and that's the focus. And in terms of the [PRT] (ph) to make sure that we have sufficient investments in all the key areas of the business where this momentum has to be preserved in the future. Those are internally key goals that we are going to pursue. And I hope that the strategic reset that I explained in my prepared remarks, somehow indicate also not only the numbers but the content on which we want to invest the numbers because it's clear that we have extraordinary strengths in our brands and brand equity and in our portfolio. It's clear that we continue to have great, high repeat rates because our products are outstanding [in light of] (ph) the consumer. I hope it's clear that our innovation is getting much stronger in many areas. And in clear that we have two big strategy reset areas. One is the lowering the exposure to declining market and declining channels and substitute this with high-growth market, high-growth channels, the best we can. And the second is actually improving the effectiveness of our marketing plan of our recruitment plans. And so we will get better support to our business, not only spending more money, but all what I said about precision marketing, is all about increasing the power of our recruitment. And finally, you heard me saying that our recruitment is being -- going to be focused more than ever on new consumers. And that, I believe, will make a big difference. And so all what I just said is really the purpose of the transition. And so the transition is going to be tailored to that.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Filippo Falorni from Citi. Please go ahead with your question.\nFilippo Falorni: Hi, good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask a few questions on the travel retail business, given we have a bit less visibility on the inventory levels. So can you -- it seems like the last two quarters, the industry decelerated in terms of sell-through, but you were up double-digit in terms of sell-in. Can you give us a sense of the inventory levels exiting the year? And Tracey, you mentioned you expect double-digit decline in fiscal '25. Can you give us any sense of the cadence of that decline? Is it more concentrated in the first half and then an improvement in the second half? Any color there would be helpful. Thank you.\nTracey Travis: Sure. So you're right. As we said, and certainly, as you mentioned, others have said also there was a decline in Asia\u2019s travel retail, particularly in China travel retail in the last few months of our fiscal 2024, and that certainly did impact us. The reason we were up, we were anniversarying very low shipments from the prior year. And so we had in certain parts of China travel retail, specifically Hainan, very low shipments in our fourth quarter last year. And so even with decelerating sales, we were replenishing relative to what we had experienced in the prior year. But because of the acceleration from Q3 to Q4, the deceleration from Q3 to Q4, we did end with inventory levels higher than what we would have liked. And so part of what you see in our first quarter results is making sure that we keep inventory levels at the level that we and our customers want in that region even managing, obviously, the volatility from month-to-month that we and our retailers are experiencing.\nFabrizio Freda: Yeah. And I just want to add the perspective that this is actually a big priority for us, is really manage much better stock normalization in TR in the future. And so the -- what you said, which is obviously the retail in quarter four went down much more than expected. So by definition, created higher temporary stocks. We are already reacting in quarter one, readjusting it. That should be seen as a better activity and better management of this in the future. And as I said in previous calls, we are also preparing to build a distribution center in Hainan that will further shorten the time between orders in travel retail and delivery that will make this process better and better over time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dana Telsey from Telsey Group. Please go ahead with your question.\nDana Telsey: Hi, good morning, everyone. As you think about the distribution channel shifts and the margin impacts, whether going on to Amazon specialty-multi, what does that mean for the business in terms of how you're seeing in North America, in particular, department stores and Amazon specialty-multi? And then with travel retail being 19% of sales, how do you see that in fiscal '25 and the progression as we move forward? Thank you.\nTracey Travis: So, I'll start with the second one, Dana. Travel retail will be lower than it was in fiscal '24 because we're expecting it to be negative all year. So it will be a lower percent of our mix. And as Fabrizio mentioned, part of what obviously is happening is we're seeing channel shifts. We're seeing some of the travel retail business go to other regions whether it's remaining within mainland China or traveling to back to international travel in certain parts of the world, including, obviously, markets in addition to within the travel retail channel. So we expect that it will continue to shrink as a percent of our mix, at least in fiscal 2025 and hopefully see some stabilization after that. In terms of the faster growth channels that we are pivoting to, I mean, obviously they represent growth. Different channels had different margins. As you know, we don't give specific channel margin information. But to the extent that those channels are allowing us to recruit new consumers, it is certainly margin accretive for the company overall when we see the kind of reversal that we saw even in the last few months, launching on Amazon with Clinique. And so I think that's something that we are focused on. Fabrizio spoke about other platforms, online being a big focus for us as well from a strategic standpoint, platforms in other parts of the world that also represent growth and the recruitment of new consumers. So that is a big area of strategic pivot for us that we expect will be margin accretive for the company overall.\nFabrizio Freda: And I\u2019d just want to add that as you have heard from our example today, a lot of these channel rebalancing is also between online and brick-and-mortar. And the online is very efficient for many reasons. On top of that, we\u2019ve used the last few years to develop online platforms that now we are in a condition to scale and to leverage in our activations of the various online channels. And finally, when you invest in a high-growth channel where the consumers are particularly active, particularly the young consumer, the return on the investment in advertising and the ability to recruit the right cost of recruitment actually increase while the cost of recruitment tends to be higher in declining channels. So the overall move for us will be actually positive in the long term. And we are managing this with the profitability mix in mind, one of the key things that we need to achieve.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Peter Grom from UBS. Please go ahead with your question.\nPeter Grom: Thanks, operator, and good morning, everyone. Hope you are doing well. I was hoping to ask, maybe, a bigger picture question here, just given all the commentary in the release on the path forward and what has been slower progress in China and Asia travel retail. When you speak to category growth returning to mid-single-digits in fiscal '25, assuming China progressively recovered, what do you think is a realistic category growth expectation in China and maybe Asia travel retail as well as we look out longer term. Specifically, just trying to understand or be curious how you think about the ability to return to 6% to 8% organic sales growth if performance in these regions and channels doesn't necessarily return to growth rates we saw prior to the recent challenges? Thanks.\nFabrizio Freda: Yeah, I'll start and then Tracey will have to speak. I assume when you say category growth, you define the category as the prestige global market in total. That's what I understood for your question. And so the overall category growth of the luxury prestige part of the beauty business historically has been growing in the mid-single-digit range. And I think the factor today with China and travel retail Asia declining double digits in this moment in those markets, you see that we are forecasting 2%, 3%. And this forecasting 2%, 3% of the category growth is the reflection that we are not assuming in our guidance for fiscal year 2025, a stabilization of that. And basically, this is our attempt, try not to guess the future that is in this moment is very difficult to predict because of the volatility that Tracey spoke about. So with that context, you see immediately that the difference between stabilized Chinese consumers. So China stabilized and the market is [indiscernible] because the market with a stable growth in China was single digit -- sorry, was mid-single-digit. And so that's the difference between the 2% and the 5%. Now if in the future, we do expect the overall global category, as you define it, to benefit of the stabilization of the China TR consumption and market, and that will make the category stronger. So assuming the category will go back to a 5% global growth also because to be clear, except now the Chinese reset in this period, the demographic fundamentals, the reason of long-term development of this category are intact globally. In fact, you see still pretty strong development in Asia ex China, in Europe, in America, as we said before, despite a gradual reduction of the growth, the growth is still mid-single-digit and plus. So the market has strong fundamentals and the market will go back as it happened in the past. In the past, during, I don't know, the recession of 2008, 2009, the market went down in the 2% and then bounced back to the normal the year after. So we have seen this many other times in the history of the market. And we as a company believe that the strategy reset that we are discussing and the ability of our Profit Recovery and Growth Plan to put us back on track for leverage-ability will put all of us in a condition to grow at least 1 point ahead of the market in the long term and to reestablish our -- the way we think of long-term algorithm as growing ahead of the market.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, our final question today comes from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question.\nRupesh Parikh: Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. So just going back to the commentary on North America market, you guys called out a strong competitive environment in the Americas. So just hoping to get more color on what you're seeing there? And as you look forward for your planning assumptions, are you expecting a further moderation in the US prestige market?\nFabrizio Freda: So in our guidance, we are reflecting the current moderation of the growth because again, in this guidance, we are not guessing the future. We are reflecting what we see currently. And this moderation of the growth, however, brings the market still in the mid-single-digit growth. So it's not -- it\u2019s not a bad market. I mean, US has been weaker than that in the past. So it's still a relatively solid market growth that is happening today. And in this relatively solid market, we are working for dramatic improvements. I think it's important to understand that we have seen progress in quarter four. Because we grew retail even if the net was difficult, but we grew retail. And again, the net was reflecting also some issues happening in many of the retailers in our less fast-growing part of the business. But the retail was growing in July as we revealed the retail has further accelerated -- our retail has further accelerated. Some of our brands like Clinique is showing very exciting progress which is super encouraging. Actually, I would say that all the brands where we have started implementing a new strategy, we see that there is extraordinary interesting progress, which is validating that once we'll be able to implement across the portfolio, all the improvements that we are trying to do, we could achieve the stabilization, which is the first goal that we have in mind, the stabilization. So, stop the decline of market share, stabilize and align with the market growth in the US. So we are -- in summary, we are cautious of the overall market in the US in this moment, but we are positive on our progress in executing an improvement strategy in America.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll conclude today's question-and-answer session.

            "name": "Fabrizio Freda",
            "content": "Thank you, Rain, and hello to everyone. Today, we will review our results for fiscal year 2024, which represented a difficult year for the company and discuss the implementation of our strategy reset to drive improving performance in fiscal year 2025 and beyond. After a challenging first half, we returned to top line growth in the second half of fiscal year 2024 with organic sales growth accelerating from 6% in the third quarter to 8% in the fourth quarter. And we delivered an adjusted operating margin of 11.6%. This level of profitability was higher than the first half and expanded from the second half of fiscal year 2023. All told, for fiscal year 2024, our organic sales declined 2%, we achieved modest gross margin expansion and adjusted operating margin contracted 120 basis points to 10.2%. These results were in line with the revised outlook we offered in May for sales and better than expected for operating profitability despite the further softening of the prestige beauty industry in China and Asia travel retail. That said, we remain unsatisfied with this performance. Looking ahead, our fiscal year 2025 outlook reflects continued declines in the prestige beauty industry in China and Asia travel retail. While the PRGP, which remains on track relatively to our previously stated goals, enable us to offset the pressure to profitability from declines in areas of our business that have high penetration of skin care, it yields a slower pace of operating margin expansions for fiscal year 2025 than we had previously expected when we expanded the PRGP in February. For fiscal year 2025, in the rest of our global business, we are planning to deliver improved performance across both developed and emerging markets. To fuel this, our strategic priorities are reigniting skin care, capitalizing on the multiple growth drivers of high-end fragrance, moving faster in leveraging winning channels, launching accretive innovation inclusive of new, big opportunities and enhancing our precision marketing capabilities for increased effectiveness and efficiency of our consumer facing investments. The PRGP enables and accelerates these strategy priorities and is the foundation to restore sustainable long-term organic sales growth and to rebuild our operating profitability. We are also creating a faster and leaner organization that will more quickly adapt to market dynamics and be better able to leverage future growth. While our sales and profit outlook for fiscal year 2025 is disappointing, this year we will make important strides as we implement our strategy reset to continue rebalancing regional growth, deliver improved annual profitability, strengthen go-to-market and innovation capabilities to elevate our execution in response to a more competitive market. These efforts will position us to both outperform the prestige beauty industry in fiscal year 2026 and accelerate profitability expansion. Let me now describe the drivers of our fiscal year 2025 outlook before discussing our strategic priorities in greater detail. The prestige beauty industry reported retail sales trends in mainland China, further weakening sequentially in the fourth quarter from a decline of mid-single-digit in the third quarter to a decrease of low double-digits. As the consumer confidence remains subdued, importantly, we gained share in the prestige beauty industry in mainland China in the fourth quarter, driven by La Mer and Estee Lauder progress in the market's far largest category of skin care. Retail sales trend for the prestige beauty industry in Asia travel retail also did not improve during the fourth quarter. This was most notable in Hainan, where retail sales in the beauty market declined over 40% despite a more favorable comparison to the previous period as the quarter unfolded. For Hainan and Asia travel retail overall, as traffic returns, conversion levels remained subdued and significantly lower than pre-pandemic levels owing to weak consumer sentiment reducing basket sizes, and to an extent, consumer diversity spending to experiences. The US prestige beauty industry retail sales growth accelerated each month throughout the fourth quarter, albeit with growth at a still compelling pace of mid-to-high single digits. Encouragingly, our company retail sales returned to growth. While we continue to see the prestige beauty share driven by the extent of our exposure to slower growth channels, our share loss was reduced in the fourth quarter. This reflects gains from gradually increasing our exposure to high growth channels like Amazon and specialty-multi. And this trend was further reinforced in July when our company retail sales growth accelerated to mid-single-digits driven by double digit growth in fragrance and hair care. Moreover, the company retail sales improved to mid-single-digit growth in skin care and we gained share in the category in July. For fiscal year 2025, we forecast the global prestige beauty industry to grow 2% to 3%, reflecting ongoing strengths in many developed and emerging markets globally. The market in the west, which collectively exited fiscal year 2024 relatively strongly, are primed to drive the industry performance. The markets in the east in total are expected to be tempered as strengths in Japan and Southeast Asia is offset by ongoing declines in mainland China and Asia travel retail. We expect the global prestige beauty industry to reaccelerate to historical mid-single-digit growth in fiscal year 2026, assuming China progressively stabilizes and then returns to growth. With this industry landscape and given the size of our business in some areas most challenged, our fiscal year 2025 organic sales growth outlook range is in a decline of 1% to an increase of 2%. Our organic sales growth outlook reflects an acceleration in several areas of business, partially offset by declines in mainland China and Asia travel detail. For our first quarter, the pressure is more acute, such that our organic sales outlook calls for a decline which Tracey will describe in further detail. For fiscal year 2025, we are refocusing consumer facing investment on the biggest opportunity, streamlining our organization to be faster and more agile in order to fuel the organic sales growth momentum we have in many areas of our business across developed and emerging markets. We also intend to better leverage the strengths of our brands in North America where we are leaders in prestige makeup, which is the region's biggest category and where we hold the top two ranked brands. And in prestige skincare, adding four of the top five ranked brands. Moreover, in North America, we also intend to leverage the market strengths across generations as we focus a balanced contribution to industry growth by age. Looking at our strategic priorities for fiscal year 2025, let me begin with skin care, which represents over 50% of our sales and is our most profitable product category. Our initiatives are designed to enable us to even better leverage our top ranked global prestige skin care portfolio to welcome new consumers and further engage our loyal consumers through elevated precision marketing, a robust accretive innovation pipeline and expanded reach in high growth channels. This starts with The Ordinary, which entered fiscal year 2025 with momentum, having growth in its organic sales by more than 20% in fiscal year 2024. The Ordinary is leading the way among our brands in capitalizing on white spaces opportunity in products, channels, and geographies. In the fourth quarter, The Ordinary launched its first product in lip care, executed a hugely successful TikTok Shop Super Brand Day campaign in the US and established its footprint in Japan. For fiscal year 2025, The Ordinary has already newly entered the body care subcategory and is preparing to expand into more emerging markets given its proven successful launches in India, the Middle East and South Africa over the last two years. Among the brands we are incubating, a star in fiscal year 2024 was NIOD in skincare. The brand has a promising future. Clinique is making great strides, executing its strategy to double down on its authentic dermatologist heritage. Clinique begun this work in the US and UK this past spring and has been expanding its global rollout. This includes its successful launch on the US Amazon Premium Beauty store in March. Impressively, Clinique has returned to share growth in the US prestige skincare with three consecutive months of gains through July. Clinique performance in US retail in July was particularly impressive, with the brand's skincare brand and makeup outperforming across subcategories and Clinique retaking the number one rank in overall prestige beauty. La Mer, along with Estee Lauder and Re-Nutriv franchise, [indiscernible] our luxury skincare strategy. With both brands poised to build on their successful in -- of fiscal year 2024 during which La Mer exceptional growth made it our best performing brand. For Re-Nutriv, we plan to build upon this fiscal year 2024 the launches of the new moisturizer and serum foundation this year through an expanded product portfolio focused on the science of skin longevity and visible age reversal. With The Ordinary, Clinique, Estee Lauder and La Mer, we are bringing to market in fiscal year 2025 a rich innovation pipeline focused on the benefits of nighttime skincare ritual, which is an incremental use education. Our brand portfolio strategically addresses various skin concerns and types with targeted ingredients and claims designed to appeal to a diverse range of consumer segments because of price and product position. Let me now turn to our next strategic priority, capitalizing on the multiple growth drivers of high-end fragrances where our luxury and artisanal portfolio of Jo Malone London, TOM FORD, Le Labo, KILIAN PARIS, Frederic Malle and AERIN Beauty collectively rose mid-single-digit organically in fiscal year 2024. The luxury tier of the fragrance category where we are number one ranked was the best performing tier in retail sales in fiscal year 2024 and we expect this to be the case again in fiscal year 2025. We are focused on further realizing the growth potential of high-end fragrances, given its broad based trends around the world to drive greater scale for the company. From Le Labo's outstanding performance in fiscal year 2024 led by Asia Pacific where its organic sales nearly doubled, to Jo Malone London's disruptive campaign with Tom Hardy to drive its men's business and we are well positioned to build on our momentum. Our brands have distribution expansion and compelling newness slated not only in the scent but also in the form and size to trade consumer into the luxury tier and we are thrilled to be expanding our luxury portfolio with the September launch of the Balmain Beauty brand which chose the fragrance category to begin its journey. We are also focused on driving accelerated sales growth in the prestige tier of the fragrance category with our Estee Lauder and Clinique brands with broad rich go-to-market activation slated for this and upcoming quarters. Let me turn our strategic priority of winning in fast growing channels globally. To do so, our mindset has shifted to more boldly merchandising our brands where consumers are increasingly discovering the shopping for beauty while executing with excellence and staying true to our high touch approach. While this encompasses both brick-and-mortar and online, today I will share with you examples from online. In the US, our launches of Clinique, Too Faced, and Bumble and bumble, on the Amazon Premium Beauty store in the second house epitomized this philosophy. Clinique launched with a skin analysis tool in March, and by June, had expanded to offer live chat with the Clinique ambassador while Bumble and bumble launched with extensive hair education from the brand's expert stylists. All three brands are off to a very strong start on the US Amazon Premium Beauty store. Clinique and, Bumble and bumble, are seeing promising uptake also with male consumers. And for Clinique, where we now have a full quarter of performance, we are encouraged by the extent of consumers subscribing for future purchases as well as the strong level of repeat purchases in the quarter. So far, in fiscal year 2025, Dr.Jart+, Smashbox and Lab Series have already opened storefronts in the US, and we have more launches on the horizon. Around the world, we are building growth momentum with social commerce, driving new consumer acquisition by engaging consumers where they're spending their time, leveraging a content-focused approach with live streaming and short-form videos and activating full funnel integration of social media and commerce. In China, we have scaled and sustained strong growth on the win with more brand launches later for fiscal year '25. Looking at Japan and Korea, we are further unlocking platform opportunities for our brand with [Line and Rakuten] (ph), and accelerating social commerce on Kakao with focus on gifting. Our final strategic initiative is enhancing our precision marketing capabilities, enabling us to be more focused on new consumer acquisition. From brand equity to product assortment, distribution and media, we are better able to target new consumers and also to accelerate the effectiveness of acquisition and efficiency spend. This capability has been designed to leverage data, including over 200 million consumers profiles we have built over the years and exclusive partnerships with AI leaders. Precision marketing is also allowing us to be far more nimble with trend to action. During fiscal year 2024, we began pilot studying in market around the world to marry trends with our rich portfolio of existing products and innovation to activate against trends with speed. We realized promising results, including successes with the peach makeup and bronzing trends. We have now formalized this process and developed the trend AI tool to enable our brand teams around the world to quickly drive trends to action. In closing, we have designed our strategy reset to position the company for a stronger future. We are wholly focused on executing with excellence across these strategic initiatives and our PRGP to again realize the proven performance of our company. To our employees, I extend my deep gratitude for your commitment amid a challenging time for our company. And now, I will turn the call over to Tracey. Thank you, Tracey. And I want to make a final comment before we turn to Q&A. Today, I announced my intention to retire from Estee Lauder companies. It has been a privilege, a great honor to lead the company for 16 years, I have been deeply enriched by exceptional colleagues around the world, and I take this decision to retire with gratitude for all we have accomplished. I have two primary objectives ahead of my retirement. First, I intend to execute with excellent strategy reset that the Tracey and I described today, inclusive of our profit recovery and growth plan. It is important to me that our next leader inherits a business with momentum. Second, I plan to work closely with our Board of Directors and my successor, once named, to ensure a smooth transition. My passion for our beautiful company is as strong as ever, and I'm confident in its bright future. Throughout the years, I've deeply enjoyed representing the company with analysts and investors. I look forward to our continued engagement until I retire. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time. Sure. As I said in the prepared remarks, I will be very involved with the Board in working on the succession. And obviously, as you know, it's the Board responsibility to decide the successor, but we are working all together to get the best output out of the work done for some time. This is a long-term process. It's not something that we are just starting working now, obviously. And in terms of the characteristic of the successor, I think the successor has to be obviously a great leader and understand the key elements of our company. And one of the key elements is being brand builders and people that can develop growth. We are a growth company, and we are a global company. And so obviously, being able to drive growth globally and being able to continue reshaping the cost structure of the company in the proper way that will become even more leverageable with future growth, are going to be essential characteristics. But I would just want to reassure you that the options that the Board has developed, they all have these characteristics. So as I said, the Board is pretty well advanced in the work needed to determine the future. And also, Lauren, I wanted to add a concept here, which is, my intention also announcing the retirement at the end of the fiscal year is also to work together with the Board, together with the team and when announced together with my successor on making sure that we put in 2025, the company in a condition to leverage growth momentum in general, in all the areas where the opportunity will be in the China market where today we see declines to continue to grow market share, and that's the focus. And in terms of the [PRT] (ph) to make sure that we have sufficient investments in all the key areas of the business where this momentum has to be preserved in the future. Those are internally key goals that we are going to pursue. And I hope that the strategic reset that I explained in my prepared remarks, somehow indicate also not only the numbers but the content on which we want to invest the numbers because it's clear that we have extraordinary strengths in our brands and brand equity and in our portfolio. It's clear that we continue to have great, high repeat rates because our products are outstanding [in light of] (ph) the consumer. I hope it's clear that our innovation is getting much stronger in many areas. And in clear that we have two big strategy reset areas. One is the lowering the exposure to declining market and declining channels and substitute this with high-growth market, high-growth channels, the best we can. And the second is actually improving the effectiveness of our marketing plan of our recruitment plans. And so we will get better support to our business, not only spending more money, but all what I said about precision marketing, is all about increasing the power of our recruitment. And finally, you heard me saying that our recruitment is being -- going to be focused more than ever on new consumers. And that, I believe, will make a big difference. And so all what I just said is really the purpose of the transition. And so the transition is going to be tailored to that. Yeah. And I just want to add the perspective that this is actually a big priority for us, is really manage much better stock normalization in TR in the future. And so the -- what you said, which is obviously the retail in quarter four went down much more than expected. So by definition, created higher temporary stocks. We are already reacting in quarter one, readjusting it. That should be seen as a better activity and better management of this in the future. And as I said in previous calls, we are also preparing to build a distribution center in Hainan that will further shorten the time between orders in travel retail and delivery that will make this process better and better over time. And I'd just want to add that as you have heard from our example today, a lot of these channel rebalancing is also between online and brick-and-mortar. And the online is very efficient for many reasons. On top of that, we've used the last few years to develop online platforms that now we are in a condition to scale and to leverage in our activations of the various online channels. And finally, when you invest in a high-growth channel where the consumers are particularly active, particularly the young consumer, the return on the investment in advertising and the ability to recruit the right cost of recruitment actually increase while the cost of recruitment tends to be higher in declining channels. So the overall move for us will be actually positive in the long term. And we are managing this with the profitability mix in mind, one of the key things that we need to achieve. Yeah, I'll start and then Tracey will have to speak. I assume when you say category growth, you define the category as the prestige global market in total. That's what I understood for your question. And so the overall category growth of the luxury prestige part of the beauty business historically has been growing in the mid-single-digit range. And I think the factor today with China and travel retail Asia declining double digits in this moment in those markets, you see that we are forecasting 2%, 3%. And this forecasting 2%, 3% of the category growth is the reflection that we are not assuming in our guidance for fiscal year 2025, a stabilization of that. And basically, this is our attempt, try not to guess the future that is in this moment is very difficult to predict because of the volatility that Tracey spoke about. So with that context, you see immediately that the difference between stabilized Chinese consumers. So China stabilized and the market is [indiscernible] because the market with a stable growth in China was single digit -- sorry, was mid-single-digit. And so that's the difference between the 2% and the 5%. Now if in the future, we do expect the overall global category, as you define it, to benefit of the stabilization of the China TR consumption and market, and that will make the category stronger. So assuming the category will go back to a 5% global growth also because to be clear, except now the Chinese reset in this period, the demographic fundamentals, the reason of long-term development of this category are intact globally. In fact, you see still pretty strong development in Asia ex China, in Europe, in America, as we said before, despite a gradual reduction of the growth, the growth is still mid-single-digit and plus. So the market has strong fundamentals and the market will go back as it happened in the past. In the past, during, I don't know, the recession of 2008, 2009, the market went down in the 2% and then bounced back to the normal the year after. So we have seen this many other times in the history of the market. And we as a company believe that the strategy reset that we are discussing and the ability of our Profit Recovery and Growth Plan to put us back on track for leverage-ability will put all of us in a condition to grow at least 1 point ahead of the market in the long term and to reestablish our -- the way we think of long-term algorithm as growing ahead of the market. So in our guidance, we are reflecting the current moderation of the growth because again, in this guidance, we are not guessing the future. We are reflecting what we see currently. And this moderation of the growth, however, brings the market still in the mid-single-digit growth. So it's not -- it's not a bad market. I mean, US has been weaker than that in the past. So it's still a relatively solid market growth that is happening today. And in this relatively solid market, we are working for dramatic improvements. I think it's important to understand that we have seen progress in quarter four. Because we grew retail even if the net was difficult, but we grew retail. And again, the net was reflecting also some issues happening in many of the retailers in our less fast-growing part of the business. But the retail was growing in July as we revealed the retail has further accelerated -- our retail has further accelerated. Some of our brands like Clinique is showing very exciting progress which is super encouraging. Actually, I would say that all the brands where we have started implementing a new strategy, we see that there is extraordinary interesting progress, which is validating that once we'll be able to implement across the portfolio, all the improvements that we are trying to do, we could achieve the stabilization, which is the first goal that we have in mind, the stabilization. So, stop the decline of market share, stabilize and align with the market growth in the US. So we are -- in summary, we are cautious of the overall market in the US in this moment, but we are positive on our progress in executing an improvement strategy in America."

            "content": "Thank you, Fabrizio, and hello, everyone. We navigated through another challenging year across several areas of our business and took specific actions to more sustainably improve our sales and profit results as it became apparent that the recovery that was anticipated to occur throughout the year in some of our markets was impacted by far more volatility. And while we returned to growth in the second half, primarily driven by resumed shipments in Asia travel retail, we are certainly not pleased with our overall full year results, and on top of global prestige volatility, the execution of our strategy has not met our expectations in some key areas of our business. During the year, we also largely completed the basic design and began the implementation of our multiyear PRGP to deliver stronger results against our expectation or a more gradual rebuilding of sales growth along with an acceleration in profitability. Before I discuss our fiscal 2025 outlook, let me first share with you the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter and full year results. Our fourth quarter organic net sales increased by 8% compared to last year, meeting our expectations, albeit with a different geographical mix than we anticipated, which reflected lower results in mainland China and North America due notably to further softening in overall prestige beauty in both of these markets. A combination of tentative consumer sentiment in China and consumer inflationary pressures in North America are believed to have contributed to the deceleration in both markets. Diluted EPS rose to $0.64 from $0.07 last year, exceeding our expectations, largely due to our operating performance and the reduction in our full year effective tax rate. From a geographic standpoint, organic net sales rose 32% in EMEA, primarily driven by the increase in our Asia travel retail business, given the favorable comparison to the prior year period as shipments increased over last year's extremely low level. In addition, organic net sales increased in both our developed European and priority emerging markets. Organic net sales in Asia Pacific decreased 4%, primarily driven by the ongoing softness in overall prestige beauty in mainland China as well as lower shipments in Hong Kong SAR as we anniversaried the initial surge in sales with the border reopening in the prior year period. Outside of these markets, net sales rose strong double-digits in Japan as a favorable currency, coupled with strong in-market activation and expanded consumer reach attracted both domestic and traveling consumers and bolstered growth across all product categories in nearly all channels of distribution. In the Americas, organic net sales decreased 5% driven by the decline in North America, reflecting the ongoing intensely competitive environment as well as an overall slowdown in growth in prestige beauty, especially in brick-and-mortar channels, which particularly impacted our skin care makeup categories. Online sales grew mid-single-digits in the region, benefiting from both retailer.com growth and the launch of select brands, specialty Clinique on the US Amazon Premium Beauty store. From a product category perspective, skincare organic net sales increased 15%, primarily due to the increased shipments within the Asia travel retail business referenced earlier, which drove net sales growth from both La Mer and Estee Lauder. Organic net sales from The Ordinary also increased across all geographic regions. Makeup organic net sales increased 1%. Net sales increased from Estee Lauder, benefiting from the resumption of shipments in our Asia travel retail business and the continued global success of the Double Wear product franchise. Clinique net sales rose strong double-digits, fueled by the Almost lipstick product franchise. Partially offsetting these increases were declines from M\u00b7A\u00b7C and TOM FORD. Organic net sales increased 2% in hair care and 1% in fragrance. Regarding fragrance, net sales growth was driven by the ongoing consumer appeal of Le Labo's unique product offerings and targeted expanded consumer reach and Jo Malone, partially offset by declines in Estee Lauder and Clinique. Our gross margin expanded 380 basis points to 71.8% compared to last year. This increase primarily reflected lower obsolescence and overhead charges as well as higher skincare sales. Operating expenses decreased 340 basis points as a percent of sales to 62.7%, driven largely by the increase in net sales, improved gross margin and lower general and administrative expenses. During the quarter, we recorded $471 million of impairment charges related to Dr.Jart+ given the continued lower-than-expected growth and profitability of the brand. We made the decision to exit the brand from its heavily discounted travel retail channel and prioritize direct investments in other more profitable areas of the business, including in mainland China and Western markets where a broader assortment of the brand has been resonating well with consumers. Operating income increased to $349 million and our operating margin expanded 700 basis points to 9% in the quarter. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.8% compared to a negative 17.9% last year, the latter having had a larger year-end true-up to reflect our final effective tax rate for the fiscal year of 2023. Our rate was better than anticipated this year, primarily due to the shift in our geographical mix of earnings. Diluted EPS increased to $0.64 from $0.07 last year due largely to the improvement in our operating results, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from the increase in our effective tax rate. Foreign currency translation was $0.03 dilutive to EPS in the quarter and the impact from the business disruptions in Israel and other parts of the Middle East was $0.02 dilutive. Turning now to our full year results. Although we saw growth in the second half, our full year results highlight both volatility and the impact of our own challenges in some key areas of our business. Collectively, the pressure in Mainland China from the ongoing softness in overall prestige beauty, the necessary actions we took in Asia travel retail during the first half of the year to reduce high trade inventory levels in a prolonged soft retail environment, and continued pressure from the competitive environment, particularly in North America, outweighed the solid growth we saw during the year in our EMEA and LatAm markets. Organic net sales decreased 2%, primarily due to the ongoing softness in overall prestige beauty in mainland China, leading to a 3% decline in Asia Pacific. The challenges in Asia travel retail also pressured sales, resulting in a 2% decline in EMEA as our return to growth in Asia travel retail in the second half was not enough to offset the first half decline due in part to retail trends decelerating throughout the second half in China. Net sales in the Americas was overall flat compared to last year. From a category perspective, skincare net sales declined 3%, largely due to the declines in mainland China and Asia travel retail and makeup decreased 1%, also reflecting these challenges as well as a prior year benefit from changes made to M\u00b7A\u00b7C's take-back loyalty program. Net sales fell 4% in hair care and rose 2% in fragrance. Confronted with the volatility throughout the year, just discussed, our teams attempted to balance cost efficiency actions with consumer-facing investments to support growth. Net sales with our specialty multi-retailers and in our freestanding stores, each grew double digits. Global travel retail represented 19% of our reported sales in fiscal 2024 and online net sales represented 28%. Our gross margin improved 30 basis points to 71.7% compared to 71.4% last year, reflecting the initiatives we took throughout the year to reduce excess and obsolete inventory as well as changes in brand mix. Partially offsetting this progress was an unfavorable impact from foreign currency and the impact from the under-absorption of overhead in our plants due to the necessary pull down of production earlier in the year. Operating expenses increased 160 basis points to 61.5% of sales, reflecting deleverage from the sales decline, including our investments to support targeted expanded consumer reach globally and to support growth where we had momentum. Operating income declined 13% to $1.6 billion from $1.8 billion last year, and our operating margin contracted 120 basis points to 10.2% for the full year. Our effective tax rate for the year was 31% compared to 26.5% last year, reflecting a higher effective tax rate on our foreign operations due to the geographical mix of our earnings and the unfavorable impact associated with previously issued stock-based compensation. Net earnings was $935 million and diluted EPS was $2.59, both declining 25% compared to last year. Foreign currency translation was $0.10 dilutive to EPS and the impact from the business disruptions in Israel and other parts of the Middle East was $0.06 dilutive. We generated $2.4 billion in net cash flows from operating activities compared to $1.7 billion last year. The increase reflects improvements in working capital, which was largely due to the actions we took to reduce in-house inventory levels. We utilized $919 million for capital investments and returned $947 million in cash to stockholders through dividends. After our initial minority investment in DECIEM in 2017 and then increasing our investment to become a majority owner in 2021, we are pleased to have completed, subject to finalization of the purchase price, our acquisition of the remaining equity interest in DECIEM this past May for $859 million, of which $829 million was paid as of June 30, 2024. Looking ahead now to our outlook for fiscal 2025. While acknowledging some initial bright spots related to pivots in our strategy, we are cognizant that overall global prestige beauty growth has tempered in recent months as reflected in the current declines in mainland China and Asia travel retail, particularly Hainan. Prestige beauty has also moderated in some of our major markets like North America. And while we believe we have the right priorities for growth, we are also mindful of the level of variability that continues to exist in many of our markets. Accordingly, we are reflecting a more subdued recovery of growth in fiscal 2025, which you have seen in this morning's press release. The PRGP remains a critical element in our ability to deliver margin expansion and ultimately is designed to put in place the cost structure necessary for the company to drive stronger leverage in its business on lower than our normal growth expectations this year. This should also yield even greater flow-through of benefits to profit as net sales progressively return to higher growth in future years. In fiscal 2024, we had already approved actions to begin addressing overcapacity in parts of our supply chain, inclusive of streamlining manufacturing and distribution costs where we could react more quickly and to simplify certain areas of our overhead structure. Our PRGP initiatives are focused on three primary benefit areas for the company, first, accelerating margin expansion through both gross margin recovery and additional expense leverage while also enabling additional cash generation for the company. Second, creating additional fuel for growth with targeted investments in consumer-facing activities. And third, simplifying our processes and creating more agility and speed in execution. We have begun executing against many initiatives within these three areas of benefit for the company. Regarding margin expansion, the significant pull down of production we did at the beginning of last year to bring manufacturing levels well below our shipment trends in order to reduce our inventory level has already yielded cash benefits in fiscal 2024. This has also resulted in additional benefits from reduced discounts and obsolescence costs and lower levels of expenses are expected to continue into fiscal 2025. Additionally, this year, we are planning to realize greater net benefits from our strategic pricing actions through less discounts and promotions with our enhanced focus on precision marketing. These actions, along with the benefits of more accretive innovation, particularly in skincare, support the gross margin expansion we expect this year. Additionally, regarding expense leverage, with our expectation of a slower return to growth, there is increased leverage pressure from our fixed costs. We are executing against our restructuring program and have already approved initiatives to reduce spans and layers in certain parts of our business. Furthermore, we are expanding our existing shared services capabilities to support the simplification and standardization of key processes and scale capabilities faster, as well as rationalizing the breadth of distribution choices across our existing portfolio of brands. We have also negotiated savings across many of our spending areas and are already realizing savings in areas like transportation. Lastly, we are taking this opportunity of the PRGP to address some of the ways we work to simplify decision-making and enhance our agility and go-to-market execution to be faster in this ever-changing dynamic global prestige beauty environment. More to come on this in a future earnings call. Also, we anticipate at this point that approximately 80% of the net benefits realized from the PRGP in fiscal 2025 are targeted to improve gross profit, with the remaining 20% targeted to reduce certain operating expenses. This mix is likely to shift in fiscal 2026 as more of our expense actions contribute favorably to our overall expense structure, given the expected cadence of initiatives. We also expect to take restructuring and other charges of at least approximately $100 million to $120 million in fiscal 2025 from approved initiatives with additional charges expected during the course of the year as more initiatives are finalized and approved. However, with modest sales growth expected in fiscal 2025, as I indicated before, we will unfortunately also experience a greater amount of fixed expense de-leverage in addition to the unfavorable mix pressure from softer sales performance in some of our higher-margin categories and regions. And as we communicated, we are protecting a portion of the savings we generate from the PRGP to reinvest selectively in advertising and store activation to fuel growth with the brands and regions where we have momentum, and support the growth we are currently experiencing with active derm, luxury fragrance and distribution expansion in faster growth channels. We began this fiscal year with our team fully immersed and committed to executing initiatives across all pillars of the PRGP now that we are post the completion of our design phase. We continue to expect to deliver approximately $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion of incremental operating profit from the full PRGP. And while we are focused on realizing slightly more than half of the net benefits in 2025, additional savings initiatives may be required as lower sales volumes are realized. Overall, we expect to progress margin expansion at an accelerated pace as a result of the plan by delivering annual margin expansion greater than our pre-pandemic historical average, inclusive of creating additional fuel to accelerate sales growth at a faster pace as well. Accordingly, fiscal 2025 is projected to be a year of transition for the company, navigating continued macroeconomic softness and challenges in a few key areas of our business, while accelerating growth where we have momentum and executing against our real -- and realizing anticipated benefits from the PRGP. Our strategic imperatives for the year, as mentioned by Fabrizio, are focused on leveraging the inherent strengths we have across our brands, categories, regions and talented employees. Over the next few years, Western markets, along with Asia Pacific markets outside of China, are expected to drive a greater portion of our long-term profitable growth as we deepen our focus on fast-growing channels in these markets. We have the opportunity to leverage our skincare brands with strong lux and active derm appeal, expand the consumer reach of our luxury fragrance portfolio, capture more relevant trends with our makeup brands and reenergize our hair care brands, all with an eye towards capturing additional consumers while retaining loyal ones. We also plan to begin leveraging our regional lines manufacturing and distribution network in Asia to create greater inventory agility as demand dictates. With that backdrop in mind and using August 12 spot rates of 1.092 for the euro, 1.276 for the pound, 7.167 for the Chinese yuan, and [1,364] (ph) for the Korean won and full fiscal year organic net sales are forecasted to range between a decrease of 1% and an increase of 2%. Throughout this past fiscal year, to mitigate the expected pressures to our business, we accelerated the implementation of initiatives under our PRGP as I previously mentioned, which we expect, combined with our sales growth range to result in most of our margin expansion for the full year to be realized in gross margin. We expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 32%. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $2.75 and $2.95 before restructuring and other charges. This includes approximately $0.03 of dilution from currency translation. In constant currency, we expect EPS to grow by approximately 7% to 15%. Net cash flows from operating activities are forecasted between $1.8 billion and $2 billion. Capital expenditures are planned at approximately 5% to 5.5% of forecasted net sales. We expect our first quarter results to be pressured by the ongoing challenges in mainland China and Asia travel retail we experienced as we exited fiscal 2024, mainly as subdued consumer sentiment, more experiential spending and lower conversion rates continue. We are, however, seeing some early signs of progress, particularly in North America, as Fabrizio mentioned, with our strategic pivots and assuming the progressive return of prestige beauty sales growth in mainland China and Asia travel retail, we anticipate overall improvement over the course of the year. With that backdrop for our first quarter, we currently expect organic net sales to fall 3% to 5%. At this time, we expect first quarter diluted EPS of $0.02 to $0.10 before restructuring and other charges. This includes approximately $0.01 of accretion from currency translation. In constant currency, we expect EPS of $0.01 to $0.09. Assuming a full year global prestige beauty performance in fiscal year 2025 of 2% to 3%, our remaining three quarters are anticipated to meet or slightly exceed this growth which is in line with our previous sales performance objective of exceeding the overall average of global prestige beauty growth by at least 1 point. With the implementation of our PRGP initiatives and if global prestige beauty accelerates further in fiscal 2026, the combination of additional sales momentum and margin accretion leverage from our PRGP should provide further progress toward returning to a more sustainable sales and profit growth algorithm. In closing, while our fiscal 2024 performance was disappointing. We remain focused on navigating the current volatile global prestige beauty dynamics, while leveraging the long-term strengths of our brands, and we maintain confidence in our strategic pivots and the execution of our PRGP to drive profitable growth in fiscal 2025 and beyond. I want to personally thank our teams globally for their resilience, commitment and dedication to the company through another difficult year. Before I turn the call back over to Fabrizio for a few final comments, as most of you know, I announced my planned retirement at the end of this fiscal year. Accordingly, I want to congratulate Akhil Srivastava on his appointment as CFO effective November 1. I look forward to working with him over this transition period and appreciate his commitment to the company and its ongoing success. And now, I'll turn it back to Fabrizio. Yeah. No, thanks, Bryan, for the question. So clearly, China and travel retail are important growth drivers for the company, have been historically and they're also high-margin areas of the company as well. So, when we see pressure in those areas as we saw in fiscal 2024, you can see what the impact on the company is. So if, right now, in our guidance, Mainland China is expected to be anywhere between flat to down high single-digits and travel retail Asia is expected to be down double-digit, that puts quite a bit of pressure on our earnings results and our EPS. The fact that this year, with those two pressures, we actually will have EPS up is really because of the contribution of the profit and recovery growth plan, the PRGP, which we will refer to it from now on, as we said in the prepared remarks. So that is delivering -- if you think about delivering around 51% at the low end of the range given the fact that we're relatively flat if you take the midpoint of our range in terms of our growth this year what we're expecting. So that means other markets like the Americas, APAC outside of China and EMEA outside of travel retail are expected to grow. But if you take that contribution, it is being offset by some expense deleverage. It's also in looking at your models, you need to add back some of the interest expense from our debt that we took out for the acquisition of TOM FORD in DECIEM and bonus as well back at target levels. So those are some of the differences. And then obviously, you heard our estimates for currency, which will be slightly dilutive for the year. So all of that puts pressure on our overall EPS. But still on a year that is close to what it was last year from a sales performance perspective, we are demonstrating improved margins and improved EPS. And that is because of -- and with a negative mix impact related to travel retail in China and that is because of both the PRGP as well as other actions the company has taken to really halt a lot of activities that we would normally do in the course of the year. We are also, importantly, as I said in our prepared remarks, protecting some investment for the momentum that we spoke about in the prepared remarks, in categories like fragrance, the active derm category and where we're seeing momentum. That will be important for us when we think forward to fiscal '26 and beyond and have more market growth, hopefully, but also those brands continuing to become a greater proportion of the business. No. Of course, Lauren. So, if you think about when we first described the PRGP, we said we have gross savings, and we are investing some of those gross savings in order to fund the program as well as fuel some of -- create fuel for some of our consumer-facing investments. And so when you think about the cadence of results and savings that we expect from the program, obviously, first quarter, there is some benefit, but that will progressively improve through the course of the year as our actions materialize. So, we are funding some of the consumer-facing investments out of the gross investments in our -- out of our PRGP. I also mentioned that even in fiscal '24, where we had green shoots, you heard, I mean, many of those strategies were put in place before, obviously, some of the innovation that we came out with and some of the plans that we had to expand in faster-growing channels. So we have tried to, in a very difficult year, even in fiscal '24, protect some of the consumer-facing investments. And as we see growth happening in certain areas, we will certainly fund more of it in some of the savings generated throughout the course of this year in the PRGP. Sure. So you're right. As we said, and certainly, as you mentioned, others have said also there was a decline in Asia's travel retail, particularly in China travel retail in the last few months of our fiscal 2024, and that certainly did impact us. The reason we were up, we were anniversarying very low shipments from the prior year. And so we had in certain parts of China travel retail, specifically Hainan, very low shipments in our fourth quarter last year. And so even with decelerating sales, we were replenishing relative to what we had experienced in the prior year. But because of the acceleration from Q3 to Q4, the deceleration from Q3 to Q4, we did end with inventory levels higher than what we would have liked. And so part of what you see in our first quarter results is making sure that we keep inventory levels at the level that we and our customers want in that region even managing, obviously, the volatility from month-to-month that we and our retailers are experiencing. So, I'll start with the second one, Dana. Travel retail will be lower than it was in fiscal '24 because we're expecting it to be negative all year. So it will be a lower percent of our mix. And as Fabrizio mentioned, part of what obviously is happening is we're seeing channel shifts. We're seeing some of the travel retail business go to other regions whether it's remaining within mainland China or traveling to back to international travel in certain parts of the world, including, obviously, markets in addition to within the travel retail channel. So we expect that it will continue to shrink as a percent of our mix, at least in fiscal 2025 and hopefully see some stabilization after that. In terms of the faster growth channels that we are pivoting to, I mean, obviously they represent growth. Different channels had different margins. As you know, we don't give specific channel margin information. But to the extent that those channels are allowing us to recruit new consumers, it is certainly margin accretive for the company overall when we see the kind of reversal that we saw even in the last few months, launching on Amazon with Clinique. And so I think that's something that we are focused on. Fabrizio spoke about other platforms, online being a big focus for us as well from a strategic standpoint, platforms in other parts of the world that also represent growth and the recruitment of new consumers. So that is a big area of strategic pivot for us that we expect will be margin accretive for the company overall."

[Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Rainey Mancini. Ma'am, you may begin.\nRainey Mancini: Hello. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Since many of our results today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges and adjustments disclosed in our press release. Unless otherwise stated, all organic net sales growth also excludes the non-comparable impacts of acquisitions, divestitures, brand closures and the impact of foreign currency translation. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our press release and on the Investors section of our website. As a reminder, reference to online sales, include sales that we make directly to our consumers through our brand.com sites and through third-party platforms. It also includes estimated sales of our products through our retailers' websites. [Operator Instructions] And now I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio.\nFabrizio Freda: Thank you, Rainey and hello to everyone. We are pleased to be with you today to review our third quarter results and discuss our strategic initiatives. For the third quarter, we delivered organic sales growth of 6% at the high end of our outlook, exceeded expectations for profitability and continued to significantly improve working capital. We achieved stronger-than-anticipated performance beginning with gross margin. Results benefited from a greater than expected mix of skin care. Moreover, we made great strides in reducing the pressure on excess and obsolescence, driven by our now lower inventory levels and in realizing strategic pricing. Further contributing to the outperformance, we manage expenses with discipline across multiple areas of the business and have shifted certain advertising spending to the fourth quarter to support our rich innovation pipeline and expanded consumer reach. Encouragingly, with our third quarter results and fourth quarter outlook, we are confident that the second half of fiscal year 2024 will indeed prove to be an inflection point for the company, representing a renewed sales and profit growth trajectory. First, momentum in organic sales growth is primed to accelerate in the fourth quarter for a strong second half. Second, we continue to expect operating margin in the second half of fiscal year 2024 to be higher than the first half and to expand from the year ago period. Third, with a profit recovery plan designed to deliver $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion of incremental operating profit in fiscal year 2025 and 2026, we are well positioned to rebuild our profitability. And with the profit recovery plan also expected to generate savings to reinvest in our brands and consumer-facing initiatives. We are well-positioned to accelerate sustainable sales and profit growth as a faster and leaner organization with stronger leverage from our future growth. During the third quarter, we accomplished much to solidify the inflection point of the second half. Indeed, we made progress in achieving targeted trade inventory levels in Asia travel retail. We are encouraged by the evolution of our Asia travel retail business this fiscal year as we execute our priority to reduce trade inventory in alignment with retailers and effort by various local authorities to contain a structured market activity. And retail sales growth in Asia travel retail significantly improved sequentially, returning to growth in the third quarter. This improving retail sales trend near travel retail complemented double-digit retail sales growth we continue to see in EMEA and the Americas travel retail. So far this fiscal year, we also invested in the long-term growth opportunities of traveling consumers evidenced by our brands having moved within Hainan and Sanya International Duty-Free shopping complex to the Galleria's new Global Beauty Plaza. The larger elegant new stores expands upon the high-touch services and experiences that we offered at the previous locations in the complex from Est\u00e9e Lauder announces its new Skin Longevity Institute to La Mer cabin offering bespoke spa services and KILIAN Paris Juice and cocktail bar featuring fragrance inspire cocktails. We also made great progress in advancing strategic initiatives and launching exciting innovation to fuel North America, reaccelerate growth in Mainland China and drive momentum in markets that are strong across developed and emerging markets in Asia Pacific, EMEA and Latin America. Let me begin with clinic where we had a robust quarter of progress as the brands double down on its authentic dermatologists brand heritage. Clinique deepened its relationship with the medical community returning to the American Academy of Dermatology Annual Meeting with high impact engagements. The brand also established the Clinique dermatologist Creator Council, a collection of doctors who are amplifying the sharing of science and dermatological insights on their own social channels, as well as informing Clinique narrative on its social platforms. Impressively, Clinique influence earned media value for skin care in the US showed 80% during the quarter, leaping 33 spots in rank. We believe this is just the beginning of the success Clinique will realized by communicating its dermatological education and clinically proven solution for skin care to make up. Moreover having started with Clinique in March, we are thrilled to be strategically expanding our consumer reach in the US as a select few brands will open dedicated storefronts in Amazon's fast-growing premium beauty store over the coming months. Clinique's launched capitalized on its renewed dermatologists guided branding with striking creative assets and elevated storytelling. Impressively, Clinique store has exceeded our retail sales expectations so far and already contributed in March to the brand's share gains in US prestige skin care biggest subcategory of moisturizers among others as well as in US prestige makeup. We also successfully accelerated our innovation in the quarter. For the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand, we brought to market breakthrough innovation across franchises. For its luxury renewed franchise, the brand was inspired by its over 15 years of skin longevity research, with its new Ultimate Diamond transformative brilliance of cream and serum cream foundation. The impact of these launches is powerful beyond contributing to the brand growth they firmly established [indiscernible] as a leader in the science of skin longevity, a visible age reversal. For Est\u00e9e Lauder Supreme franchise, the brand leveraged its decades of [indiscernible] repair expertise in collagen research with the new revitalizing Supreme night bounce cream first launched to rave reviews in Asia Pacific and expanding globally in the coming months. We believe this launch holds great promise, serving to strengthen the brand leadership in nighttime science and skin care across subcategories. La Mer extended its winning streak of innovation with the most rising fresh cream which along with its Icon Hero products drove the brand to be the strongest contribution to the company growth for the quarter. Beyond these strategic innovations and go-to-market activations across active derma, longevity, night skincare, M A C introduced newness in makeup to jump start our rich innovation pipeline in the category for the second half. M A C launched Macximal silky matte lipstick to greater claim successfully modernizing its Icon M\u00b7A\u00b7C lipstick with nourishing ingredients and bolder packaging. From Seoul to Berlin to New York City events Macximal pop up events drove strong engagement and earned media value. M\u00b7A\u00b7C remastered studio 6 fixed fluid foundation came to market in April delivering a new soft map finish enhanced with new skincare ingredients at even more shades. This high sought innovation and its icon prove the enduring love of M\u00b7A\u00b7C consumers and the capacities alike, as the brand celebrates its 40 years in 2024. Looking at fragrances. Over the last couple of months, we have expanded our consumer reach in the high-potential Asia Pacific region, opening spectacular flagship stores for Jo Malone London and [indiscernible], each unique with locally relevant features. And we are incredibly excited for the evolution in luxury and artisanal sciences as together with Valmond, we introduced Valmond Beauty this September. Across our brands and around the world, we are focused on leveraging technology, including AI in support of our enduring strengths and high-touch experiences and high-quality products. We continue to partner with leading technology companies from Microsoft with whom we are collaborating to embed AI to drive faster speed to market and local relevance to Google Cloud, as we strive to enhance customized targeting of media at scale. Turning to the regions. We have spoken about our focus on driving the momentum in markets which are strong. To that end, we have delivered terrific results across many markets, reflecting the desirability of our brands, a compelling innovation which I described and strong go-to-market execution. We see this across our developed and emerging markets around the world. Beginning in Asia Pacific, Hong Kong, SAR, Japan have prospered up double-digit organically in the quarter and year-to-date and we are excited about what's to come including the launch of the ordinary in Japan, during the fourth quarter. Moving to EMEA, Germany and Italy have consistently contributed to growth in the markets of the region each quarter. Mexico, Brazil and India, strong double-digit growth in the third quarter fueled excellent performance in our emerging markets year-to-date. For North America, we delivered sequentially improved organic sales trends in the third quarter, driven by the multi-facet strategic plan we first discussed with you in August. We are pleased with the results we are seeing in our areas of strategic focus. Skin Care grew organically in North America for the third consecutive quarter, driven by Est\u00e9e Lauder and the ordinary, health hero products, innovation and go-to-market activation excelled. Our luxury and our seasonal fragrances rose double-digits organically one more fueled by Jo Malone, London, KILIAN PARIS and TOM FORD. Across our brand portfolio in North America, we are realizing success, as we focus on deepening consumer engagement on social platforms, where so much discovery in beauty take place. The Ordinary has long been a pioneer with an outstanding social engine and more of our brands have enhanced their engagement with consumers this year. We are also successfully expanding our consumer reach to better serve new consumers from Clinique's new storefront in the US Amazon Premium Beauty store to expansions early this fiscal year as the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand entered into more Ultra Beauty stores and KILLIAN PARIS entered into additional Sephora stores. For Clinique as the number one dermatology beauty brand in the US Prestige, we are optimistic for the positive impact is launched on the US Amazon Premium Beauty store will have for the fourth quarter in the initial performance in March. For Mainland China, we returned to organic sales growth, albeit at a slower pace than expected amid an overall soft prestige beauty industry. Retail sales for prestige beauty were strong in January but moderated in February and March, due in part to the Chinese New Year considering the Valentine Day this year which limited gifts. This certainly impacted the industry but also many of our brands which have a strong presence in gifting. Our focus remains bringing irresistible newness to consumers to best create growth opportunities. Here our innovation in Est\u00e9e Lauder Nutriv and Supreme franchise as well as a La Mer and M\u00b7A\u00b7C were well received across the third quarter and we have more compelling launches in the fourth quarter. One in particular from Est\u00e9e Lauder Perfectionist Pro franchise is especially exciting as it is among the first product created in our China innovation labs and addresses local demand for SPF 50 plus UV protection that is suitable for sensitive and post derm procedures of the skin. With a four quarter innovation pipeline is standing upon the innovation pipeline is standing upon the innovation launch throughout the third quarter and the key shopping moments of 618 are coming we are increasing our investment in advertising a go-to-market activation to sustain retail. Since we spoke with you in February, we also made important progress in all work streams across the pillar of the profit recovery plan, of which I'm pleased to share a few examples with you today. For one our integrated business planning process which has now rolled out globally is contributing to operational inventory improvements. Our enterprise-wide integrated business planning will serve as the foundation to drive better demand planning and reduce excess enable obsolescence. It is complemented by advanced planning technologies including AI to statistically elevate forecast accuracy, a dynamically positioned and deploy inventories. We have refined and optimized our innovation pipeline for fiscal year 2025 and 2026 to best focus on accretive innovation, bringing to market products that both creates and drive trends locally and globally across categories. Innovation in fiscal year 2025 is still expected to be even bigger and stronger than in fiscal year 2024, with more breakthrough innovation and expansion into white space opportunities. We also announced plans to streamline manufacturing and distribution on a campus through realigning ship schedules consolidating operations into fewer buildings and shifting powder manufacturing to a trusted third-party partners. This strategic initiative accomplished multiple objectives. As in addition to consolidating capacity and optimizing costs, we also expect greater speed to market by leveraging more external innovation with a global leader in powder. Before I close, I want to speak to the exciting milestones in our brand portfolio during the fourth quarter. First, a few days ago marked a one-year anniversary of our Tom Ford acquisition, this transformational deal where we evolved from licensees of Tom Ford Beauty to the owner and licensor of Tom Ford solidified a coveted brand in the company luxury portfolio for the long-term and created a new royalty revenue stream. Moreover, it afforded us strategic synergies which we are now unlocking demonstrated by the recent launch of brand.com in the US and UK as just one example. And with the Ermenegildo Zegna Group and Marcolin, we are capitalizing on the power of the brand modern luxury glimmer across fashion, eyewear and beauty connecting these three verticals in compelling new ways to drive growth. Indeed in February, for Fashion Weeks from Milan to London, Paris and New York, we orchestrated the first-ever 360-degree cross-category campaign and secured a blockbuster fragrance launch. Later this months, we are thrilled to be further solidifying our brand portfolio in yet another way, as we acquired the remaining interest invasion, completing the deal we made three years ago when we became a majority owner. During these three years DECIEM Inc and its beloved brands The Ordinary, assured to new heights, ranking top five in prestige skin care in many markets including top two in its home markets of Canada and the US. Together, we have successfully invested to scale innovation for The Ordinary and have increased the ordinary innovation as a percentage of sales from 5% to over 25% expected this fiscal year, expanded the brand globally from India to the Middle East to South Africa and improved its profitability by driving operational efficiencies in the supply chain. With that said, we believe The Ordinary and DECIEM still have bigger opportunities in front of them and we are excited for what the future holds. Finally, we are pleased to see our initiatives and progress in sustainability recognized. And since we spoke with you in February, we were included in the CDP's Climate A list for 2023. Overall, we received our best-ever collective scores in 2023 from CDP as along with these excellent climate results we scored A- in each of the water security, forest timbers and forest palm oil. In closing, we are at an inflection point in our company performance, primed for a strong second half of organic sales growth and improved profitability. And with our profit recovery plan, we are well positioned to meaningful rebuild our profitability in fiscal year 2025 and '26, while also generating savings to reinvest in our brands and consumer-facing initiatives. We are confident in our strategy to realize the promising growth opportunities of global prestige beauty, leveraging the strengths of our diversified brand portfolio, rich innovation pipeline and the superior quality of our products. I extend my gratitude to our employees for the significant contribution you have made in bringing us to this inflection point of a renewed sales and profit growth trajectory. I will now turn the call over to Tracey.\nTracey Travis: Thank you, Fabrizio and hello everyone. Our third quarter organic net sales increased 6% at the higher end of our expectations. As Fabrizio mentioned, we are pleased with the progress we've made thus far in Asia travel retail, with reducing retailer inventory and the corresponding return to net sales growth. These achievements in the quarter were a bit earlier than expected and led to a partial shift in the expected timing of the resumption of replenishment orders from the fourth quarter to the third. Partially offsetting this growth was lower-than-expected net sales in Mainland China, reflecting the impact of ongoing softness in overall prestige beauty, in part due to subdued consumer confidence and softness during holiday and key shopping moments. Our earnings per share of $0.97 exceeded our outlook for the quarter, due to the acceleration of skin care, the return to net sales growth in our Asia travel retail business, tighter expense management and a lower tax rate. The reduction in our tax rate was largely driven by the shift in our geographical mix of business. Regarding our regions, organic net sales in our Europe, the Middle East and Africa region increased 12%, driven largely by the growth in our Travel Retail business. Our Travel Retail net sales increased strong double digits, returning to growth after seven consecutive quarters of decline given the sequential acceleration of retail sales and shipments, as well as the anniversary of lower shipments last year, which were pressured by transitory headwinds in Hainan in Korea, as well as limited international flights, visas and group tours from China to other markets last year. Elsewhere in EMEA, organic net sales in our priority emerging markets increased strong double digits where we drove growth from most brands and in most channels of distribution given our strategic initiative to expand consumer reach in particular for our fragrance and skincare brands. Our results in mature markets were mixed resulting in overall flat growth. Organic net sales in our Asia Pacific region increased 3% led by Hong Kong SAR, Mainland China and Japan reflecting mid-single-digit net sales growth in skin care and high single-digit growth in fragrance. Organic net sales in the Americas increased 1% largely due to Latin America where continued growth in Mexico and Brazil led by makeup drove double-digit increases in department stores and freestanding stores. Organic net sales in North America were flat in the quarter as growth in fragrance and skin care was offset by declines in makeup and hair care. The double-digit growth in specialty-multi driven by Est\u00e9e Lauder and M\u00b7A\u00b7C was offset by softer performance in department stores and direct-to-consumer channels. From a category standpoint, organic net sales in skin care rose 9% largely driven by our Asia travel retail business as well as from Hong Kong SAR and Mainland China. Organic net sales from La Mer and Est\u00e9e Lauder propelled the category's growth led by strong campaigns behind our hero product franchises with new product innovation and increased in-store activations. Organic net sales in makeup increased 4%, largely driven by our Asia travel retail business and by Latin America. Net sales from Est\u00e9e Lauder and Clinique led the category's growth fueled by ongoing activations behind our hero product franchises. This was partially offset by a prior year benefit from changes made to M\u00b7A\u00b7C's take-back loyalty program. Excluding the impact from the prior year benefit, M\u00b7A\u00b7C net sales increased mid-single digits with growth across all regions mainly driven by new product innovation. Organic net sales in fragrance increased 1% and in hair care declined 4%. In fragrance net sales growth was driven by our luxury and artisanal brands led by Jo Malone London and Le Labo. Jo Malone London grew double digits in travel retail and specialty-multi. Le Labo saw double-digit growth in our direct-to-consumer channels particularly in freestanding stores, driven by both same-door growth and targeted expanded consumer reach. Partially offsetting these increases was a decline from Est\u00e9e Lauder due to retail softness during holiday and key shopping moments. Our gross margin increased 280 basis points compared to last year. This reflects positive impacts from changes in category mix driven by the acceleration of skin care, lower obsolescence charges given the reduction in excess inventory compared to last year and stronger strategic price realization through lower levels of promotion. These improvements were partially offset as expected by the impact of the previous pull down of production that triggered a requirement to recognize the related manufacturing costs in the current period instead of when products are sold. This resulted in a 215 basis point headwind to gross margin. Foreign currency also pressured gross margin in the quarter. Operating expenses decreased 290 basis points as a percent of sales during the quarter, driven by the sales growth leverage and expense management including advertising and promotional expense, which decreased approximately 240 basis points compared to last year. This reduction reflects the anticipated shift in certain spending from the third quarter to the fourth to support innovation launches in key holiday moments in the fourth quarter. Operating income increased 75% to $554 million, and our operating margin expanded 570 basis points to 14.1%, compared to 8.4% last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.5%, compared to the elevated rate of 43.1% last year. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by a lower effective tax rate on our foreign operations due to the difference in timing of the estimated change in our full year geographical mix of earnings in the current and prior year periods. This was partially offset by the unfavorable impact associated with previously issued stock-based compensation. Diluted EPS was $0.97 compared to $0.47 last year largely due to the increase in sales improvement in gross profit margin and a lower tax rate. The impact from the business disruptions in Israel and other parts of the Middle East was $0.01 dilutive to EPS in the quarter. The acquisition of the Tom Ford brand was neutral to EPS as interest expense related to our debt financing was offset by the combined benefits derived as the licensor of the brand from royalty revenue this year and savings from no longer having to pay royalties on the beauty business. For the nine months, we generated $1.5 billion in net cash flows from operating activities compared to $1 billion last year. The increase from last year reflects lower working capital, which was largely due to the actions we have taken to reduce in-house inventory levels primarily finished goods and semi-finished goods that resulted in a significant improvement in our days to sell. We invested $702 million in capital expenditures and we returned $710 million in cash to stockholders through dividends. As Fabrizio mentioned, our plans under the profit recovery plan are progressing and are on track. This quarter we began taking charges under the restructuring program and expect approval to accelerate in the fourth quarter of this year and throughout fiscal 2025 with meaningful benefits beginning to flow into our fiscal year 2025 results. Turning now to our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2024. We are pleased with our progress thus far in reducing inventory levels, resuming replenishment shipments in Asia travel retail, accelerating innovation and selectively expanding our consumer reach. These efforts have led to sequential improvements in both net sales and operating margin from the first half of the year, culminating in our return to profitable net sales growth this quarter. With these results and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we continue to expect a stronger second half compared to last year, underscoring that we believe we are at a sales and profitability inflection point. While we delivered on the high end of our third quarter expectations, we are lowering our fiscal 2024 organic net sales outlook range to reflect continued risks from evolving macroeconomic volatility, including continued softness in Mainland China and geopolitical tensions in certain areas around the world. In Asia Travel Retail, we are also mindful of potential short-term volatility in retail sales related to actions certain retailers are taking to increase their profitability. With the recalibration between our third and fourth quarters, we discussed earlier we are maintaining our full year operating margin expectation and are increasing our EPS outlook slightly to reflect disciplined expense management year-to-date somewhat offset by our plans to strategically invest in key areas of our business in the fourth quarter to continue to drive profitable growth and reflecting incremental headwinds from foreign currency translation. The combination of our third quarter performance and outlook for the fourth quarter results in a strong second half compared to the first half with improvements in net sales and operating margin. Excluding the in-period charge we recognized in the third quarter, gross margin is also expected to improve in the second half. We believe our assumptions for the second half mark a meaningful turning point for the company, demonstrating the signs of our recovery and better position us along with our profit recovery plan initiatives to drive sales growth and profitability further in fiscal 2025 and beyond. Using March 29 spot rates of 1.079 for the euro, 1.262 for the pound, 7.227 for the Chinese Yuan; and 13.50 for the Korean won, currency translation is anticipated to negatively impact reported sales and diluted EPS for both the fourth quarter and the full year. We now expect organic net sales for our fourth quarter to increase 6% to 10% with increased consumer facing investments including shifts from the third quarter and aligned to support innovation in key shopping moments in the fourth quarter. This growth also reflects the anniversary of some business disruptions we experienced last year, primarily in Hainan. In Mainland China, we expect the ongoing softness of overall prestige beauty to continue to pressure net sales. Currency translation is expected to be dilutive to reported net sales by one point. We expect fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $0.18 to $0.28, an increase of over 100%. Currency translation is expected to dilute EPS by $0.01 and potential risks of business disruptions in the Middle East are expected to be dilutive by $0.03. Adjusted EPS in constant currency is expected to range between $0.19 to $0.29. For the full year, we expect organic net sales to range between a 1% to 2% decline. Currency translation is expected to be dilutive to reported net sales by one point. Our full year operating margin outlook remains unchanged and is expected to be between 9% and 9.5%, a contraction from 11.4% last year. We continue to expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 35% compared to 26.5% last year. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $2.14 and $2.24 before restructuring and other charges. Currency translation and potential risks of business disruptions in Israel and other parts of the Middle East are expected to dilute earnings per share by $0.09 and $0.06, respectively. In constant currency, we expect EPS to decrease between 33% to 36%. Our fiscal 2024 outlook also assumes the purchase of the remaining outstanding equity interest in DECIEM anticipated to be completed in May of 2024. In closing, our expected second half results starting with our strong third quarter performance demonstrate our progressive return to sales growth and profitability. We have navigated through numerous challenges over this past year with resilience and determination to take meaningful actions to begin to improve the trajectory of our business. Our results show we have made great strides and we have immense gratitude for the resolve and hard work of our teams globally. And while we are pleased with our progress and results this quarter, we remain keenly aware of the additional work that lies ahead to continue down the path of restoring stronger profit margins. We are intensely focused on doing the necessary work to return to long-term sustainable growth and profitability supported by the profit recovery plan initiatives and executed by our dedicated employees. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time.\nOperator: The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.\nBryan Spillane: Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. So Tracey, I just wanted to ask I guess a question about the 4Q guide and what's implied. So I guess, the implied margin in 4Q steps down from 3Q, yet the revenue will be roughly the same. It just implies maybe there's not as much leverage. But so if you can just give us some perspective on the margin step down quarter-to-quarter. And then as we think about the run rate into 2025 is there anything that we should read into the fourth quarter guide that would sort of inform exit rate for 2024 into 2025 both in terms of organic sales and margins. Thank you.\nTracey Travis: Thanks, Bryan. When you think about the fourth quarter and what I said in my prepared remarks, I talked about some shifts that are occurring in the fourth quarter. So we did shift some advertising expense out of the third quarter and into the fourth quarter and that was to support some of the timing of the activity that we had in the fourth quarter both innovation as well as some of the holidays in the fourth quarter. I also talked about the fact that Travel Retail \u2013 Asia Travel Retail, we resumed shipments earlier than what we had expected in the third quarter. So there are \u2013 it's hard to look at Q3, Q4, you really need to look at the second half together because of some of those shifts. What's impacting our fourth quarter performance is \u2013 and the change in our guidance is softer growth of prestige beauty in Mainland China. The continued macro uncertainty that retailers are cautious in many markets have. We also have higher currency than what we had expected. So that is pressuring our EPS a bit as well. But when you look at the second half compared to prior guidance, what you will see is some of the expense savings that we realized and that I again talked about in my prepared remarks, we are actually flowing through. So we are offsetting some of the currency downside that we had and we're also offsetting some of the sales softness that is embedded in our updated guidance range.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Olivia Tong from Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question.\nOlivia Tong: Great. Thank you. You mentioned several times that you've seen improvement towards targeted retail inventory levels in travel retail but not quite there yet. So can you talk about exit rate on the quarter more recent performance in Asia Travel Retail, particularly in Hainan and Korea and then also China both on and offline. And just what consumption looks like more recently your views on the 618 festival upcoming. It sounds like you're going to spend a bit more money on that than you had previously anticipated and just your outlook there. Thank you.\nFabrizio Freda: So, global trade retail return to growth also driven by frankly growth and retail growth across all the regions. So, the first important point is retail sales growth. And this was very, very strong in EMEA Americas in many parts of APAC and was single-digit in the China TR part. But this is a very important progress versus the past. And this is for Est\u00e9e companies brands is great news also for the future. The second thing that we are seeing is a very robust traffic recovery across the travel retail channel which is driving the sales to travelers there is work to be done still on conversion which is the areas of improvement that we are still working on, but we had a lot of work and progress in this by activations and retail division activating particularly in Hainan with a lot of activity and this activation are working. And so we see progress also in this area. And then as it was part of your question, because of all these elements strong improvement in the inventories in our retailers and so reaching the targets in several retailers and in several SKUs ahead of our original communicated target. So, at the end, this created a very good growth which is based on retail growth and sell into replenishment because of the decreased inventory levels versus the past. This combination is very solid. We expect this to continue and to progress in line with our goals.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lauren Lieberman from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.\nLauren Lieberman: Great. Thanks. I just had a question about spending levels. It was great. Tracey thanks for being so specific on the advertising and the reinvestment this quarter and then shipped into 4Q. But if I remember in 3Q, there was also some timing shift on spend. So, I wanted to talk a little bit about maybe the decision tree of like when to put that spending in? Is it -- because if it's shifting is it about pace of getting innovation ready and launched? Is it about the consumer environment, maybe avoid putting money in play that would be like pushing on a string if the consumer isn't there. But it does feel like some of those spending plans are shifting gently quarter-to-quarter. And so I was curious if you could just comment on that. Thanks.\nTracey Travis: Yes, well, you outlined a few of the reasons that we would make a decision to shift some of the spending. So, one of the things that we saw early in the quarter towards the middle of the quarter is that some of the holidays particularly in China were not performing as we had anticipated. I think we mentioned in our prepared remarks holidays that are important for us Chinese New Year and Valentine's Day. We're closer this year, actually overlapped a bit than in prior years. Valentine's Day is actually a pretty strong gifting moment for us in China. Our team does a fantastic job of supporting Valentine's Day -- both Chinese New Year and Valentine's Day are less promotional holidays than some of the other holidays. But we didn't see the lift that we would normally see out of those holidays and trending into other holidays in the quarter we made the decision or the China team made the decision that it was best to shift some of that advertising to the fourth quarter and support some of the holidays that are upcoming in May and then obviously the big 618 holiday in June. So one of the things that we've talked about for a long time is the agility that we have created particularly in our advertising spend that allows us to take some of those decisions so that we can better match our advertising spend and when we think consumers will be reacting and responding whether it's to our gifting programs or our innovation programs. So that is what you saw in Lauren in the Q3 Q4 shift.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\nDara Mohsenian : Hi, Tracey, I wanted to stick with that question, but perhaps look out more longer-term. Obviously, you mentioned higher investment in fiscal Q4 and the shift from Q3 and also you had better-than-expected expense management in Q3. So can you just take a step back and discuss the pace of reinvestment you expect behind the business over the next few years? How much of that is captured in the difference between gross and net savings and the profit recovery program? And then how the pace of that reinvestment fits with the savings from the profit recovery program and how you think about the savings. So, really the cadence annually looking at reinvestment versus savings as you look out over the next few years. And how they interrelate with each other?\nTracey Travis : Great. No, thank you for the question. So, yes, let me take the opportunity to talk as you asked about the profit recovery plan. We're always focused on profitable growth, let me start there. The actions that we're taking both within the profit recovery plan as well as outside of the profit recovery plan are focused on profitable growth. The profit recovery plan is an accelerator of our growth and in particular an accelerator of our margins. And let me just try to simplify it a bit. I know we've said that we will share which we will more with you in August once our plans are complete and we provide guidance for the next year, but the profit recovery plan is first and foremost focused on restoration of our gross margin. Now we're mindful of shifts in category mix and channel mix relative to history. Obviously, we had growth in fragrance in our artisanal and luxury fragrance portfolio and that's very important. We're also focused on restoration of our makeup growth. But certainly as you saw in this past quarter, we are also experiencing the acceleration of our very important skin care category, and we expect that that will continue. The biggest drain on our margin has been our gross margin. And it's in the aftermath of the pandemic. It has been the biggest focus of our recovery, and we are focused on price realization. Part of that will be driven by the actions that we are taking in terms of inventory management to control discounts in excess and obsolescence. You saw a bit of the results of that in Q3. And you will see certainly more of that in fiscal 2025. So that is a very big focus of our profit recovery plan, the focus on restoration of our gross margins. We're also focused on supply chain efficiencies that will help our gross margins and accretive innovation. And we talked about some of the processes in Fabrizio's prepared remarks that we are deploying and strengthening in order to be able to do that. The second area of focus is greater leverage of our expense base. We have efforts in indirect procurement in terms of accelerating some of the savings there. And we have -- are taking some difficult decisions as it relates to rightsizing and streamlining parts of our organization and that's the restructuring program that we spoke to you about before. That is really the combination of that should drive the $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion of incremental operating profit over two years. And again, we said that slightly more of that will happen in fiscal '25 then in '26. And again, in terms of the mix of where that recovery is expected more in gross profit margin, but also in our operating expenses. But I want to take the opportunity to talk about a couple of other benefits as it relates to the profit recovery plan. So in addition to the margin recovery, the program is expected to fund additional investment to your point for growth namely in consumer activation, more consumer activation for our brand. So the expectation is, we are going to save more than the $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion that we are committing to in terms of operating profit improvement in order to also increase some of our advertising spend retarget and selectively against the momentum that we see in our business. And last, but not least, we expect to streamline and reduce some of the complexity in the organization that is built up over time in our processes and that's expected to increase our speed, agility and effectiveness in our markets. And I know our organization in particular very much looks forward to this benefit. So, it's a powerful program. I'm glad you asked about it. When we deliver on all elements of it and we will share more in terms of helping with the modeling of it in August.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Filippo Falorni from Citi. Please go ahead with your question.\nFilippo Falorni: Hey good morning everyone. I had a question on the Mainland China business. You clearly mentioned strong start in January, but then a deceleration. You mentioned that the exit rate has been soft in the country. So maybe you can comment particularly like, what you've seen more recently from a category growth standpoint, promotional activity levels and maybe market share? And then maybe longer term, if you take a step back, based on your analysis on the market, what do you think has been the main driver of the weakness? Is it mainly macro related? Is it more trade down in the category? Or are competitors doing better? Any sense of what the drivers of this slowdown will be helpful. Thank you.\nFabrizio Freda: Yes, sure. On the -- in this moment, the slowdown, the softness is the overall prestige market. And that's what is softer than what we originally expected and that's what is stuck in Mainland China. What I want to clarify is that, we need to look at the -- we do look at the Chinese consumers in total and not only the segmentation the market does. So there is a Mainland China's consumers, there is Hong Kong SR. There is the TR China which includes Hainan for example in other parts and there are the international traveling people, which for tourism or business travel from China to Tokyo, Paris et cetera. So, we see actually progress in the total Chinese consumer consumption on our brands and they are very solid. And when you took Mainland plus the progress in Hong Kong SIL plus the TR China retail progress that I was speaking about in the previous question, plus the success we see of our brands internationally the Chinese travelers now are growing more for example in Japan, for example in Paris. And so when you put all these numbers and frankly, they are all solid numbers, except the international travelers in other cities, which is an estimate in our model, but we see clear progress and there is progress between quarter two and quarter three despite the softness in Mainland, and there is actually their turn positive, very interestingly positive in quarter four estimates for the future. So, the trends are also depend by channel. And the drivers, first of all, at different consumers, the consumers that travel both for vacation and internationally tend to have been the high end. In this moment, the softness is more in the middle in the consumer sentiment of the middle class. We tend to be shopping more in Mainland and these channels follow different trends and different -- depending on the moment, depending on the situation, but the equities of the brands are strong, as seen by the overall progress, particularly certain brands which are doing -- growing in the total already as we speak and continue to accelerate in our portfolio. And the future of the -- this is positive. There is a sense of recovery in the overall consumption, although via channel, there are different percentages, different evolution, and this can be different also by quarter, by semester, depending on the various trends that happen. So we look internally to the Chinese consumer as a whole and not only to the various parts. Then your question was what have been the key drivers behind this. Now, one of the key drivers, obviously is the skin care trend, and the fact that in the post-COVID, the consumers have been having -- are having a period where they're focusing more on experiences -- on overall experiences a consumption spending in their portfolio on overall experience like travel like other categories or like restaurants or like things like that. So this will evolve, is evolving in every single market after COVID and become more balanced over time. That's our experience, and that's visible already. So that's one of the drivers. It's the consumer priority by category and experiences versus goods. The second thing is the -- we are accelerating innovation in a big way. We have invested in a R&D center in China. We see the results of this innovation, but with the first innovation coming from the R&D center will be in quarter four, and we will see the impact of it, which is very dedicated to specific Chinese consumers, so part of the drivers has been the amount of innovation and the quality of innovation that can be deployed for quality, I mean, also local relevancy of the innovation and this is an improving trend. It is already enforcement trend, which gives very, very solid indications for the future. So the other driver has been promotionality. The market has been during COVID promotional, but in this moment, all the activities that the governments have decided to do on the structured market is reducing the level of structure market also the price increases that many of the retailers are taking also in travel retail are in the short-term are impacting the consumption ,particularly the middle class level in Mainland. But on the contrary in the long-term will further balance the proportion between a structure and structured market, which is obviously in line with our goals and is the objective. So it's a positive long-term trend, which is happening. But the market will remain promotional. And so that's why we have the activation of promotionality particularly in the area of sampling, gifting to the points that Tracey was making before is on an increase and the level of discounts is on a decreased trend and that's the change in the proportionality model. But all-in-all, I just want to make sure that we understand that despite the short-term softness of the market in Mainland China, the overall trend of Chinese consumers is positive and this trend is expected to accelerate in the future.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Powers from Deutsche. Please go ahead with your question.\nSteve Powers: Yes, hey good morning, Fabrizio and Tracey. Thanks for the question. So I wanted to clarify, I think Olivia had asked about it, but on the trade inventory in China, it sounds like on certain SKUs, certain parts of the portfolio you're ahead of schedule and clearing that inventory backlog. But the total portfolio seems like it didn't quite hit that April 1st target you had. So is that the right read and just your confidence in being able to ship to consumption across the total portfolio in the fourth quarter? Is that intact? Or is that part of the lower organic outlook for the fourth quarter versus what was implied back in December. The second question that I really want to\u2026\nTracey Travis: Yeah, no.\nSteve Powers: Sorry go ahead, Tracey. And I can follow-up if that's okay.\nTracey Travis: No, no, go ahead with your second question, Steve.\nSteve Powers: Well, that was a clarification. So I want to put Clinique on Amazon. Historically, you've cited for a long time hurdles launching on that platform that were at least to me a combination of questions around achievable unit economics on that platform, the brand experience for consumers and being able to curate that effectively. And then just your own visibility into the required consumer insights. So just to the extent that that's correct, how did you overcome those hurdles and get to a point where Clinique on Amazon in your mind is the right time for that? Thank you.\nTracey Travis: Okay, Steve. So I'll take the first part of that question on the inventory in Asia Travel Retail and Fabrizio will take the Amazon Clinique follow-up question. Regarding the inventory in trade in Asia Travel Retail, we did reach the objectives that we had in the third quarter actually before April. And so the reason that we ended up shifting a bit more from -- or doing a bit more from a replenishment standpoint in the third quarter is because we actually reached those levels a bit earlier than what we had anticipated. We anticipate reaching them by April, which is the beginning of the fourth quarter obviously, and we reached them within the third quarter. So that is the reason why some of the shipments were a bit higher in the third quarter and we will expect the retail sell-through in the fourth quarter. And so \u2013 and as Fabrizio mentioned, we are expecting as well an acceleration of retail in the fourth quarter. Just remember for the cadence of what we're anniversarying we actually had some disruption even in the fourth quarter as it related to Hainan last year. So we are going to see a bit of a disconnect between retail and net for a couple of quarters because of the significance of the interruptions that we had both at the beginning of the third quarter last year and the end of the fourth quarter last year, as well. And so we would expect that net will as we replenish relative to the comparison year-over-year to last year then that would be ahead of retail but we will be maintaining the inventory levels in the range that we and our retailers have agreed to.\nFabrizio Freda: Yes. And on Clinique-Amazon I want to say, one of the important progress we are making on Clinique is the initiative of building on Clinique heritage in active derma and relaunch the brands in North America and UK in this moment and globally soon on this overall platform. The Amazon introduction in the US is also right for Clinique in the context of this big launch because a lot of new consumers that are very high consumers of active derma are also in this chart. Amazon provides expanded consumer reach a lot of new consumers we expect to recruit, to engage and to educate new consumer by this new channel. Amazon in this moment is a fast-growing online platform in the US and the premium Beauty store has been clearly a contributor to the overall market growth and particularly has been an important brand discovery for some consumers and also consumers are new consumers to Clinique. And so the early results are very promising. And the first period has been extraordinarily positive frankly and we have expectation that this will continue and will accelerate over time. So part of your question why was the right moment now, I think because now the model of Amazon has evolved in a situation where there is a better fit between the Clinique brands and the Amazon model and the opportunity to communicate the heritage, the equity, the education and the various ideas behind the science of active derma of Clinique is now there. And so we believe the brand can express its fundamentals correctly on the platform and the work that the Clinique team has done in providing amazing asset quality of execution to achieve a very good quality expression of the brand on the platform also reassured us that is the right moment and is a very good fit. And as I said initial results are confirming that.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Andrea Teixeira from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.\nAndrea Teixeira: Thank you. Good morning. I have a question for Fabrizio and then one clarification for Tracy. Fabrizio, I have a question on the US sales. If you're seeing any acceleration in shipments as you exit the quarter, it seems that the third quarter was still negative excluding the strength in Brazil and Mexico. So, I wonder if you can comment on how this innovation that you're putting and more money behind M\u00b7A\u00b7C and Clinique has been handing out as you exit the quarter? And also a clarification for Tracey. I appreciate all the details of the profit recovery into fiscal 2025. By my math roughly the $700 million operating profit benefit at the midpoint. Should we be thinking of this benefit being mostly spread with seasonality and excluding the shorter quarters or mostly back half weighted as you do this plan? Thank you.\nTracey Travis: So, I'll take your last part of the question first. We'll give more guidance on the calendarization of the profit recovery plan in August. We're still -- we're well into the finalization of some of those plans and making taking some decisions within the next couple of months. So, we'll be able to provide you with much better guidance on calendarization in the August time frame.\nFabrizio Freda: Yes. On the U.S. -- no, I think -- actually U.S. in quarter three has been growing low single -- sorry North America in quarter three is growing low single-digit. And if you exclude the M\u00b7A\u00b7C loyalty program actually it's getting closer to mid-single-digits. So, is -- there is growth in North America in quarter three. Said this, there is softness in consumer sentiment in this moment and the market growth is moderating in North America. So, obviously, there is pressure in -- particularly in certain channels. There is pressure but the quarter three was in the right direction and it was in line with our goals. And for us the positive is that we had for example a positive impact on Clinique on the part of March. And in this part of March, already we saw the impact of that -- positive impact of that. If we -- you can assume that we will have in the full quarter four, the impact of Clinique on Amazon, this for example, will be a positive element in the mix. We assure that.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude today's question-and-answer session. If you were unable to join for the entire call, a playback will be available at 1:00 P.M.

            "name": "Fabrizio Freda",
            "content": "Thank you, Rainey and hello to everyone. We are pleased to be with you today to review our third quarter results and discuss our strategic initiatives. For the third quarter, we delivered organic sales growth of 6% at the high end of our outlook, exceeded expectations for profitability and continued to significantly improve working capital. We achieved stronger-than-anticipated performance beginning with gross margin. Results benefited from a greater than expected mix of skin care. Moreover, we made great strides in reducing the pressure on excess and obsolescence, driven by our now lower inventory levels and in realizing strategic pricing. Further contributing to the outperformance, we manage expenses with discipline across multiple areas of the business and have shifted certain advertising spending to the fourth quarter to support our rich innovation pipeline and expanded consumer reach. Encouragingly, with our third quarter results and fourth quarter outlook, we are confident that the second half of fiscal year 2024 will indeed prove to be an inflection point for the company, representing a renewed sales and profit growth trajectory. First, momentum in organic sales growth is primed to accelerate in the fourth quarter for a strong second half. Second, we continue to expect operating margin in the second half of fiscal year 2024 to be higher than the first half and to expand from the year ago period. Third, with a profit recovery plan designed to deliver $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion of incremental operating profit in fiscal year 2025 and 2026, we are well positioned to rebuild our profitability. And with the profit recovery plan also expected to generate savings to reinvest in our brands and consumer-facing initiatives. We are well-positioned to accelerate sustainable sales and profit growth as a faster and leaner organization with stronger leverage from our future growth. During the third quarter, we accomplished much to solidify the inflection point of the second half. Indeed, we made progress in achieving targeted trade inventory levels in Asia travel retail. We are encouraged by the evolution of our Asia travel retail business this fiscal year as we execute our priority to reduce trade inventory in alignment with retailers and effort by various local authorities to contain a structured market activity. And retail sales growth in Asia travel retail significantly improved sequentially, returning to growth in the third quarter. This improving retail sales trend near travel retail complemented double-digit retail sales growth we continue to see in EMEA and the Americas travel retail. So far this fiscal year, we also invested in the long-term growth opportunities of traveling consumers evidenced by our brands having moved within Hainan and Sanya International Duty-Free shopping complex to the Galleria's new Global Beauty Plaza. The larger elegant new stores expands upon the high-touch services and experiences that we offered at the previous locations in the complex from Este\u0301e Lauder announces its new Skin Longevity Institute to La Mer cabin offering bespoke spa services and KILIAN Paris Juice and cocktail bar featuring fragrance inspire cocktails. We also made great progress in advancing strategic initiatives and launching exciting innovation to fuel North America, reaccelerate growth in Mainland China and drive momentum in markets that are strong across developed and emerging markets in Asia Pacific, EMEA and Latin America. Let me begin with clinic where we had a robust quarter of progress as the brands double down on its authentic dermatologists brand heritage. Clinique deepened its relationship with the medical community returning to the American Academy of Dermatology Annual Meeting with high impact engagements. The brand also established the Clinique dermatologist Creator Council, a collection of doctors who are amplifying the sharing of science and dermatological insights on their own social channels, as well as informing Clinique narrative on its social platforms. Impressively, Clinique influence earned media value for skin care in the US showed 80% during the quarter, leaping 33 spots in rank. We believe this is just the beginning of the success Clinique will realized by communicating its dermatological education and clinically proven solution for skin care to make up. Moreover having started with Clinique in March, we are thrilled to be strategically expanding our consumer reach in the US as a select few brands will open dedicated storefronts in Amazon's fast-growing premium beauty store over the coming months. Clinique's launched capitalized on its renewed dermatologists guided branding with striking creative assets and elevated storytelling. Impressively, Clinique store has exceeded our retail sales expectations so far and already contributed in March to the brand's share gains in US prestige skin care biggest subcategory of moisturizers among others as well as in US prestige makeup. We also successfully accelerated our innovation in the quarter. For the Este\u0301e Lauder brand, we brought to market breakthrough innovation across franchises. For its luxury renewed franchise, the brand was inspired by its over 15 years of skin longevity research, with its new Ultimate Diamond transformative brilliance of cream and serum cream foundation. The impact of these launches is powerful beyond contributing to the brand growth they firmly established [indiscernible] as a leader in the science of skin longevity, a visible age reversal. For Este\u0301e Lauder Supreme franchise, the brand leveraged its decades of [indiscernible] repair expertise in collagen research with the new revitalizing Supreme night bounce cream first launched to rave reviews in Asia Pacific and expanding globally in the coming months. We believe this launch holds great promise, serving to strengthen the brand leadership in nighttime science and skin care across subcategories. La Mer extended its winning streak of innovation with the most rising fresh cream which along with its Icon Hero products drove the brand to be the strongest contribution to the company growth for the quarter. Beyond these strategic innovations and go-to-market activations across active derma, longevity, night skincare, M A C introduced newness in makeup to jump start our rich innovation pipeline in the category for the second half. M A C launched Macximal silky matte lipstick to greater claim successfully modernizing its Icon M\u00b7A\u00b7C lipstick with nourishing ingredients and bolder packaging. From Seoul to Berlin to New York City events Macximal pop up events drove strong engagement and earned media value. M\u00b7A\u00b7C remastered studio 6 fixed fluid foundation came to market in April delivering a new soft map finish enhanced with new skincare ingredients at even more shades. This high sought innovation and its icon prove the enduring love of M\u00b7A\u00b7C consumers and the capacities alike, as the brand celebrates its 40 years in 2024. Looking at fragrances. Over the last couple of months, we have expanded our consumer reach in the high-potential Asia Pacific region, opening spectacular flagship stores for Jo Malone London and [indiscernible], each unique with locally relevant features. And we are incredibly excited for the evolution in luxury and artisanal sciences as together with Valmond, we introduced Valmond Beauty this September. Across our brands and around the world, we are focused on leveraging technology, including AI in support of our enduring strengths and high-touch experiences and high-quality products. We continue to partner with leading technology companies from Microsoft with whom we are collaborating to embed AI to drive faster speed to market and local relevance to Google Cloud, as we strive to enhance customized targeting of media at scale. Turning to the regions. We have spoken about our focus on driving the momentum in markets which are strong. To that end, we have delivered terrific results across many markets, reflecting the desirability of our brands, a compelling innovation which I described and strong go-to-market execution. We see this across our developed and emerging markets around the world. Beginning in Asia Pacific, Hong Kong, SAR, Japan have prospered up double-digit organically in the quarter and year-to-date and we are excited about what's to come including the launch of the ordinary in Japan, during the fourth quarter. Moving to EMEA, Germany and Italy have consistently contributed to growth in the markets of the region each quarter. Mexico, Brazil and India, strong double-digit growth in the third quarter fueled excellent performance in our emerging markets year-to-date. For North America, we delivered sequentially improved organic sales trends in the third quarter, driven by the multi-facet strategic plan we first discussed with you in August. We are pleased with the results we are seeing in our areas of strategic focus. Skin Care grew organically in North America for the third consecutive quarter, driven by Este\u0301e Lauder and the ordinary, health hero products, innovation and go-to-market activation excelled. Our luxury and our seasonal fragrances rose double-digits organically one more fueled by Jo Malone, London, KILIAN PARIS and TOM FORD. Across our brand portfolio in North America, we are realizing success, as we focus on deepening consumer engagement on social platforms, where so much discovery in beauty take place. The Ordinary has long been a pioneer with an outstanding social engine and more of our brands have enhanced their engagement with consumers this year. We are also successfully expanding our consumer reach to better serve new consumers from Clinique's new storefront in the US Amazon Premium Beauty store to expansions early this fiscal year as the Este\u0301e Lauder brand entered into more Ultra Beauty stores and KILLIAN PARIS entered into additional Sephora stores. For Clinique as the number one dermatology beauty brand in the US Prestige, we are optimistic for the positive impact is launched on the US Amazon Premium Beauty store will have for the fourth quarter in the initial performance in March. For Mainland China, we returned to organic sales growth, albeit at a slower pace than expected amid an overall soft prestige beauty industry. Retail sales for prestige beauty were strong in January but moderated in February and March, due in part to the Chinese New Year considering the Valentine Day this year which limited gifts. This certainly impacted the industry but also many of our brands which have a strong presence in gifting. Our focus remains bringing irresistible newness to consumers to best create growth opportunities. Here our innovation in Este\u0301e Lauder Nutriv and Supreme franchise as well as a La Mer and M\u00b7A\u00b7C were well received across the third quarter and we have more compelling launches in the fourth quarter. One in particular from Este\u0301e Lauder Perfectionist Pro franchise is especially exciting as it is among the first product created in our China innovation labs and addresses local demand for SPF 50 plus UV protection that is suitable for sensitive and post derm procedures of the skin. With a four quarter innovation pipeline is standing upon the innovation pipeline is standing upon the innovation launch throughout the third quarter and the key shopping moments of 618 are coming we are increasing our investment in advertising a go-to-market activation to sustain retail. Since we spoke with you in February, we also made important progress in all work streams across the pillar of the profit recovery plan, of which I'm pleased to share a few examples with you today. For one our integrated business planning process which has now rolled out globally is contributing to operational inventory improvements. Our enterprise-wide integrated business planning will serve as the foundation to drive better demand planning and reduce excess enable obsolescence. It is complemented by advanced planning technologies including AI to statistically elevate forecast accuracy, a dynamically positioned and deploy inventories. We have refined and optimized our innovation pipeline for fiscal year 2025 and 2026 to best focus on accretive innovation, bringing to market products that both creates and drive trends locally and globally across categories. Innovation in fiscal year 2025 is still expected to be even bigger and stronger than in fiscal year 2024, with more breakthrough innovation and expansion into white space opportunities. We also announced plans to streamline manufacturing and distribution on a campus through realigning ship schedules consolidating operations into fewer buildings and shifting powder manufacturing to a trusted third-party partners. This strategic initiative accomplished multiple objectives. As in addition to consolidating capacity and optimizing costs, we also expect greater speed to market by leveraging more external innovation with a global leader in powder. Before I close, I want to speak to the exciting milestones in our brand portfolio during the fourth quarter. First, a few days ago marked a one-year anniversary of our Tom Ford acquisition, this transformational deal where we evolved from licensees of Tom Ford Beauty to the owner and licensor of Tom Ford solidified a coveted brand in the company luxury portfolio for the long-term and created a new royalty revenue stream. Moreover, it afforded us strategic synergies which we are now unlocking demonstrated by the recent launch of brand.com in the US and UK as just one example. And with the Ermenegildo Zegna Group and Marcolin, we are capitalizing on the power of the brand modern luxury glimmer across fashion, eyewear and beauty connecting these three verticals in compelling new ways to drive growth. Indeed in February, for Fashion Weeks from Milan to London, Paris and New York, we orchestrated the first-ever 360-degree cross-category campaign and secured a blockbuster fragrance launch. Later this months, we are thrilled to be further solidifying our brand portfolio in yet another way, as we acquired the remaining interest invasion, completing the deal we made three years ago when we became a majority owner. During these three years DECIEM Inc and its beloved brands The Ordinary, assured to new heights, ranking top five in prestige skin care in many markets including top two in its home markets of Canada and the US. Together, we have successfully invested to scale innovation for The Ordinary and have increased the ordinary innovation as a percentage of sales from 5% to over 25% expected this fiscal year, expanded the brand globally from India to the Middle East to South Africa and improved its profitability by driving operational efficiencies in the supply chain. With that said, we believe The Ordinary and DECIEM still have bigger opportunities in front of them and we are excited for what the future holds. Finally, we are pleased to see our initiatives and progress in sustainability recognized. And since we spoke with you in February, we were included in the CDP's Climate A list for 2023. Overall, we received our best-ever collective scores in 2023 from CDP as along with these excellent climate results we scored A- in each of the water security, forest timbers and forest palm oil. In closing, we are at an inflection point in our company performance, primed for a strong second half of organic sales growth and improved profitability. And with our profit recovery plan, we are well positioned to meaningful rebuild our profitability in fiscal year 2025 and '26, while also generating savings to reinvest in our brands and consumer-facing initiatives. We are confident in our strategy to realize the promising growth opportunities of global prestige beauty, leveraging the strengths of our diversified brand portfolio, rich innovation pipeline and the superior quality of our products. I extend my gratitude to our employees for the significant contribution you have made in bringing us to this inflection point of a renewed sales and profit growth trajectory. I will now turn the call over to Tracey. So, global trade retail return to growth also driven by frankly growth and retail growth across all the regions. So, the first important point is retail sales growth. And this was very, very strong in EMEA Americas in many parts of APAC and was single-digit in the China TR part. But this is a very important progress versus the past. And this is for Este\u0301e companies brands is great news also for the future. The second thing that we are seeing is a very robust traffic recovery across the travel retail channel which is driving the sales to travelers there is work to be done still on conversion which is the areas of improvement that we are still working on, but we had a lot of work and progress in this by activations and retail division activating particularly in Hainan with a lot of activity and this activation are working. And so we see progress also in this area. And then as it was part of your question, because of all these elements strong improvement in the inventories in our retailers and so reaching the targets in several retailers and in several SKUs ahead of our original communicated target. So, at the end, this created a very good growth which is based on retail growth and sell into replenishment because of the decreased inventory levels versus the past. This combination is very solid. We expect this to continue and to progress in line with our goals. Yes, sure. On the -- in this moment, the slowdown, the softness is the overall prestige market. And that's what is softer than what we originally expected and that's what is stuck in Mainland China. What I want to clarify is that, we need to look at the -- we do look at the Chinese consumers in total and not only the segmentation the market does. So there is a Mainland China's consumers, there is Hong Kong SR. There is the TR China which includes Hainan for example in other parts and there are the international traveling people, which for tourism or business travel from China to Tokyo, Paris et cetera. So, we see actually progress in the total Chinese consumer consumption on our brands and they are very solid. And when you took Mainland plus the progress in Hong Kong SIL plus the TR China retail progress that I was speaking about in the previous question, plus the success we see of our brands internationally the Chinese travelers now are growing more for example in Japan, for example in Paris. And so when you put all these numbers and frankly, they are all solid numbers, except the international travelers in other cities, which is an estimate in our model, but we see clear progress and there is progress between quarter two and quarter three despite the softness in Mainland, and there is actually their turn positive, very interestingly positive in quarter four estimates for the future. So, the trends are also depend by channel. And the drivers, first of all, at different consumers, the consumers that travel both for vacation and internationally tend to have been the high end. In this moment, the softness is more in the middle in the consumer sentiment of the middle class. We tend to be shopping more in Mainland and these channels follow different trends and different -- depending on the moment, depending on the situation, but the equities of the brands are strong, as seen by the overall progress, particularly certain brands which are doing -- growing in the total already as we speak and continue to accelerate in our portfolio. And the future of the -- this is positive. There is a sense of recovery in the overall consumption, although via channel, there are different percentages, different evolution, and this can be different also by quarter, by semester, depending on the various trends that happen. So we look internally to the Chinese consumer as a whole and not only to the various parts. Then your question was what have been the key drivers behind this. Now, one of the key drivers, obviously is the skin care trend, and the fact that in the post-COVID, the consumers have been having -- are having a period where they're focusing more on experiences -- on overall experiences a consumption spending in their portfolio on overall experience like travel like other categories or like restaurants or like things like that. So this will evolve, is evolving in every single market after COVID and become more balanced over time. That's our experience, and that's visible already. So that's one of the drivers. It's the consumer priority by category and experiences versus goods. The second thing is the -- we are accelerating innovation in a big way. We have invested in a R&D center in China. We see the results of this innovation, but with the first innovation coming from the R&D center will be in quarter four, and we will see the impact of it, which is very dedicated to specific Chinese consumers, so part of the drivers has been the amount of innovation and the quality of innovation that can be deployed for quality, I mean, also local relevancy of the innovation and this is an improving trend. It is already enforcement trend, which gives very, very solid indications for the future. So the other driver has been promotionality. The market has been during COVID promotional, but in this moment, all the activities that the governments have decided to do on the structured market is reducing the level of structure market also the price increases that many of the retailers are taking also in travel retail are in the short-term are impacting the consumption ,particularly the middle class level in Mainland. But on the contrary in the long-term will further balance the proportion between a structure and structured market, which is obviously in line with our goals and is the objective. So it's a positive long-term trend, which is happening. But the market will remain promotional. And so that's why we have the activation of promotionality particularly in the area of sampling, gifting to the points that Tracey was making before is on an increase and the level of discounts is on a decreased trend and that's the change in the proportionality model. But all-in-all, I just want to make sure that we understand that despite the short-term softness of the market in Mainland China, the overall trend of Chinese consumers is positive and this trend is expected to accelerate in the future. Yes. And on Clinique-Amazon I want to say, one of the important progress we are making on Clinique is the initiative of building on Clinique heritage in active derma and relaunch the brands in North America and UK in this moment and globally soon on this overall platform. The Amazon introduction in the US is also right for Clinique in the context of this big launch because a lot of new consumers that are very high consumers of active derma are also in this chart. Amazon provides expanded consumer reach a lot of new consumers we expect to recruit, to engage and to educate new consumer by this new channel. Amazon in this moment is a fast-growing online platform in the US and the premium Beauty store has been clearly a contributor to the overall market growth and particularly has been an important brand discovery for some consumers and also consumers are new consumers to Clinique. And so the early results are very promising. And the first period has been extraordinarily positive frankly and we have expectation that this will continue and will accelerate over time. So part of your question why was the right moment now, I think because now the model of Amazon has evolved in a situation where there is a better fit between the Clinique brands and the Amazon model and the opportunity to communicate the heritage, the equity, the education and the various ideas behind the science of active derma of Clinique is now there. And so we believe the brand can express its fundamentals correctly on the platform and the work that the Clinique team has done in providing amazing asset quality of execution to achieve a very good quality expression of the brand on the platform also reassured us that is the right moment and is a very good fit. And as I said initial results are confirming that. Yes. On the U.S. -- no, I think -- actually U.S. in quarter three has been growing low single -- sorry North America in quarter three is growing low single-digit. And if you exclude the M\u00b7A\u00b7C loyalty program actually it's getting closer to mid-single-digits. So, is -- there is growth in North America in quarter three. Said this, there is softness in consumer sentiment in this moment and the market growth is moderating in North America. So, obviously, there is pressure in -- particularly in certain channels. There is pressure but the quarter three was in the right direction and it was in line with our goals. And for us the positive is that we had for example a positive impact on Clinique on the part of March. And in this part of March, already we saw the impact of that -- positive impact of that. If we -- you can assume that we will have in the full quarter four, the impact of Clinique on Amazon, this for example, will be a positive element in the mix. We assure that."

            "name": "Tracey Travis",
            "content": "Thank you, Fabrizio and hello everyone. Our third quarter organic net sales increased 6% at the higher end of our expectations. As Fabrizio mentioned, we are pleased with the progress we've made thus far in Asia travel retail, with reducing retailer inventory and the corresponding return to net sales growth. These achievements in the quarter were a bit earlier than expected and led to a partial shift in the expected timing of the resumption of replenishment orders from the fourth quarter to the third. Partially offsetting this growth was lower-than-expected net sales in Mainland China, reflecting the impact of ongoing softness in overall prestige beauty, in part due to subdued consumer confidence and softness during holiday and key shopping moments. Our earnings per share of $0.97 exceeded our outlook for the quarter, due to the acceleration of skin care, the return to net sales growth in our Asia travel retail business, tighter expense management and a lower tax rate. The reduction in our tax rate was largely driven by the shift in our geographical mix of business. Regarding our regions, organic net sales in our Europe, the Middle East and Africa region increased 12%, driven largely by the growth in our Travel Retail business. Our Travel Retail net sales increased strong double digits, returning to growth after seven consecutive quarters of decline given the sequential acceleration of retail sales and shipments, as well as the anniversary of lower shipments last year, which were pressured by transitory headwinds in Hainan in Korea, as well as limited international flights, visas and group tours from China to other markets last year. Elsewhere in EMEA, organic net sales in our priority emerging markets increased strong double digits where we drove growth from most brands and in most channels of distribution given our strategic initiative to expand consumer reach in particular for our fragrance and skincare brands. Our results in mature markets were mixed resulting in overall flat growth. Organic net sales in our Asia Pacific region increased 3% led by Hong Kong SAR, Mainland China and Japan reflecting mid-single-digit net sales growth in skin care and high single-digit growth in fragrance. Organic net sales in the Americas increased 1% largely due to Latin America where continued growth in Mexico and Brazil led by makeup drove double-digit increases in department stores and freestanding stores. Organic net sales in North America were flat in the quarter as growth in fragrance and skin care was offset by declines in makeup and hair care. The double-digit growth in specialty-multi driven by Este\u0301e Lauder and M\u00b7A\u00b7C was offset by softer performance in department stores and direct-to-consumer channels. From a category standpoint, organic net sales in skin care rose 9% largely driven by our Asia travel retail business as well as from Hong Kong SAR and Mainland China. Organic net sales from La Mer and Este\u0301e Lauder propelled the category's growth led by strong campaigns behind our hero product franchises with new product innovation and increased in-store activations. Organic net sales in makeup increased 4%, largely driven by our Asia travel retail business and by Latin America. Net sales from Este\u0301e Lauder and Clinique led the category's growth fueled by ongoing activations behind our hero product franchises. This was partially offset by a prior year benefit from changes made to M\u00b7A\u00b7C's take-back loyalty program. Excluding the impact from the prior year benefit, M\u00b7A\u00b7C net sales increased mid-single digits with growth across all regions mainly driven by new product innovation. Organic net sales in fragrance increased 1% and in hair care declined 4%. In fragrance net sales growth was driven by our luxury and artisanal brands led by Jo Malone London and Le Labo. Jo Malone London grew double digits in travel retail and specialty-multi. Le Labo saw double-digit growth in our direct-to-consumer channels particularly in freestanding stores, driven by both same-door growth and targeted expanded consumer reach. Partially offsetting these increases was a decline from Este\u0301e Lauder due to retail softness during holiday and key shopping moments. Our gross margin increased 280 basis points compared to last year. This reflects positive impacts from changes in category mix driven by the acceleration of skin care, lower obsolescence charges given the reduction in excess inventory compared to last year and stronger strategic price realization through lower levels of promotion. These improvements were partially offset as expected by the impact of the previous pull down of production that triggered a requirement to recognize the related manufacturing costs in the current period instead of when products are sold. This resulted in a 215 basis point headwind to gross margin. Foreign currency also pressured gross margin in the quarter. Operating expenses decreased 290 basis points as a percent of sales during the quarter, driven by the sales growth leverage and expense management including advertising and promotional expense, which decreased approximately 240 basis points compared to last year. This reduction reflects the anticipated shift in certain spending from the third quarter to the fourth to support innovation launches in key holiday moments in the fourth quarter. Operating income increased 75% to $554 million, and our operating margin expanded 570 basis points to 14.1%, compared to 8.4% last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.5%, compared to the elevated rate of 43.1% last year. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by a lower effective tax rate on our foreign operations due to the difference in timing of the estimated change in our full year geographical mix of earnings in the current and prior year periods. This was partially offset by the unfavorable impact associated with previously issued stock-based compensation. Diluted EPS was $0.97 compared to $0.47 last year largely due to the increase in sales improvement in gross profit margin and a lower tax rate. The impact from the business disruptions in Israel and other parts of the Middle East was $0.01 dilutive to EPS in the quarter. The acquisition of the Tom Ford brand was neutral to EPS as interest expense related to our debt financing was offset by the combined benefits derived as the licensor of the brand from royalty revenue this year and savings from no longer having to pay royalties on the beauty business. For the nine months, we generated $1.5 billion in net cash flows from operating activities compared to $1 billion last year. The increase from last year reflects lower working capital, which was largely due to the actions we have taken to reduce in-house inventory levels primarily finished goods and semi-finished goods that resulted in a significant improvement in our days to sell. We invested $702 million in capital expenditures and we returned $710 million in cash to stockholders through dividends. As Fabrizio mentioned, our plans under the profit recovery plan are progressing and are on track. This quarter we began taking charges under the restructuring program and expect approval to accelerate in the fourth quarter of this year and throughout fiscal 2025 with meaningful benefits beginning to flow into our fiscal year 2025 results. Turning now to our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2024. We are pleased with our progress thus far in reducing inventory levels, resuming replenishment shipments in Asia travel retail, accelerating innovation and selectively expanding our consumer reach. These efforts have led to sequential improvements in both net sales and operating margin from the first half of the year, culminating in our return to profitable net sales growth this quarter. With these results and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we continue to expect a stronger second half compared to last year, underscoring that we believe we are at a sales and profitability inflection point. While we delivered on the high end of our third quarter expectations, we are lowering our fiscal 2024 organic net sales outlook range to reflect continued risks from evolving macroeconomic volatility, including continued softness in Mainland China and geopolitical tensions in certain areas around the world. In Asia Travel Retail, we are also mindful of potential short-term volatility in retail sales related to actions certain retailers are taking to increase their profitability. With the recalibration between our third and fourth quarters, we discussed earlier we are maintaining our full year operating margin expectation and are increasing our EPS outlook slightly to reflect disciplined expense management year-to-date somewhat offset by our plans to strategically invest in key areas of our business in the fourth quarter to continue to drive profitable growth and reflecting incremental headwinds from foreign currency translation. The combination of our third quarter performance and outlook for the fourth quarter results in a strong second half compared to the first half with improvements in net sales and operating margin. Excluding the in-period charge we recognized in the third quarter, gross margin is also expected to improve in the second half. We believe our assumptions for the second half mark a meaningful turning point for the company, demonstrating the signs of our recovery and better position us along with our profit recovery plan initiatives to drive sales growth and profitability further in fiscal 2025 and beyond. Using March 29 spot rates of 1.079 for the euro, 1.262 for the pound, 7.227 for the Chinese Yuan; and 13.50 for the Korean won, currency translation is anticipated to negatively impact reported sales and diluted EPS for both the fourth quarter and the full year. We now expect organic net sales for our fourth quarter to increase 6% to 10% with increased consumer facing investments including shifts from the third quarter and aligned to support innovation in key shopping moments in the fourth quarter. This growth also reflects the anniversary of some business disruptions we experienced last year, primarily in Hainan. In Mainland China, we expect the ongoing softness of overall prestige beauty to continue to pressure net sales. Currency translation is expected to be dilutive to reported net sales by one point. We expect fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $0.18 to $0.28, an increase of over 100%. Currency translation is expected to dilute EPS by $0.01 and potential risks of business disruptions in the Middle East are expected to be dilutive by $0.03. Adjusted EPS in constant currency is expected to range between $0.19 to $0.29. For the full year, we expect organic net sales to range between a 1% to 2% decline. Currency translation is expected to be dilutive to reported net sales by one point. Our full year operating margin outlook remains unchanged and is expected to be between 9% and 9.5%, a contraction from 11.4% last year. We continue to expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 35% compared to 26.5% last year. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $2.14 and $2.24 before restructuring and other charges. Currency translation and potential risks of business disruptions in Israel and other parts of the Middle East are expected to dilute earnings per share by $0.09 and $0.06, respectively. In constant currency, we expect EPS to decrease between 33% to 36%. Our fiscal 2024 outlook also assumes the purchase of the remaining outstanding equity interest in DECIEM anticipated to be completed in May of 2024. In closing, our expected second half results starting with our strong third quarter performance demonstrate our progressive return to sales growth and profitability. We have navigated through numerous challenges over this past year with resilience and determination to take meaningful actions to begin to improve the trajectory of our business. Our results show we have made great strides and we have immense gratitude for the resolve and hard work of our teams globally. And while we are pleased with our progress and results this quarter, we remain keenly aware of the additional work that lies ahead to continue down the path of restoring stronger profit margins. We are intensely focused on doing the necessary work to return to long-term sustainable growth and profitability supported by the profit recovery plan initiatives and executed by our dedicated employees. And that concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time. Thanks, Bryan. When you think about the fourth quarter and what I said in my prepared remarks, I talked about some shifts that are occurring in the fourth quarter. So we did shift some advertising expense out of the third quarter and into the fourth quarter and that was to support some of the timing of the activity that we had in the fourth quarter both innovation as well as some of the holidays in the fourth quarter. I also talked about the fact that Travel Retail \u2013 Asia Travel Retail, we resumed shipments earlier than what we had expected in the third quarter. So there are \u2013 it's hard to look at Q3, Q4, you really need to look at the second half together because of some of those shifts. What's impacting our fourth quarter performance is \u2013 and the change in our guidance is softer growth of prestige beauty in Mainland China. The continued macro uncertainty that retailers are cautious in many markets have. We also have higher currency than what we had expected. So that is pressuring our EPS a bit as well. But when you look at the second half compared to prior guidance, what you will see is some of the expense savings that we realized and that I again talked about in my prepared remarks, we are actually flowing through. So we are offsetting some of the currency downside that we had and we're also offsetting some of the sales softness that is embedded in our updated guidance range. Yes, well, you outlined a few of the reasons that we would make a decision to shift some of the spending. So, one of the things that we saw early in the quarter towards the middle of the quarter is that some of the holidays particularly in China were not performing as we had anticipated. I think we mentioned in our prepared remarks holidays that are important for us Chinese New Year and Valentine's Day. We're closer this year, actually overlapped a bit than in prior years. Valentine's Day is actually a pretty strong gifting moment for us in China. Our team does a fantastic job of supporting Valentine's Day -- both Chinese New Year and Valentine's Day are less promotional holidays than some of the other holidays. But we didn't see the lift that we would normally see out of those holidays and trending into other holidays in the quarter we made the decision or the China team made the decision that it was best to shift some of that advertising to the fourth quarter and support some of the holidays that are upcoming in May and then obviously the big 618 holiday in June. So one of the things that we've talked about for a long time is the agility that we have created particularly in our advertising spend that allows us to take some of those decisions so that we can better match our advertising spend and when we think consumers will be reacting and responding whether it's to our gifting programs or our innovation programs. So that is what you saw in Lauren in the Q3 Q4 shift. Great. No, thank you for the question. So, yes, let me take the opportunity to talk as you asked about the profit recovery plan. We're always focused on profitable growth, let me start there. The actions that we're taking both within the profit recovery plan as well as outside of the profit recovery plan are focused on profitable growth. The profit recovery plan is an accelerator of our growth and in particular an accelerator of our margins. And let me just try to simplify it a bit. I know we've said that we will share which we will more with you in August once our plans are complete and we provide guidance for the next year, but the profit recovery plan is first and foremost focused on restoration of our gross margin. Now we're mindful of shifts in category mix and channel mix relative to history. Obviously, we had growth in fragrance in our artisanal and luxury fragrance portfolio and that's very important. We're also focused on restoration of our makeup growth. But certainly as you saw in this past quarter, we are also experiencing the acceleration of our very important skin care category, and we expect that that will continue. The biggest drain on our margin has been our gross margin. And it's in the aftermath of the pandemic. It has been the biggest focus of our recovery, and we are focused on price realization. Part of that will be driven by the actions that we are taking in terms of inventory management to control discounts in excess and obsolescence. You saw a bit of the results of that in Q3. And you will see certainly more of that in fiscal 2025. So that is a very big focus of our profit recovery plan, the focus on restoration of our gross margins. We're also focused on supply chain efficiencies that will help our gross margins and accretive innovation. And we talked about some of the processes in Fabrizio's prepared remarks that we are deploying and strengthening in order to be able to do that. The second area of focus is greater leverage of our expense base. We have efforts in indirect procurement in terms of accelerating some of the savings there. And we have -- are taking some difficult decisions as it relates to rightsizing and streamlining parts of our organization and that's the restructuring program that we spoke to you about before. That is really the combination of that should drive the $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion of incremental operating profit over two years. And again, we said that slightly more of that will happen in fiscal '25 then in '26. And again, in terms of the mix of where that recovery is expected more in gross profit margin, but also in our operating expenses. But I want to take the opportunity to talk about a couple of other benefits as it relates to the profit recovery plan. So in addition to the margin recovery, the program is expected to fund additional investment to your point for growth namely in consumer activation, more consumer activation for our brand. So the expectation is, we are going to save more than the $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion that we are committing to in terms of operating profit improvement in order to also increase some of our advertising spend retarget and selectively against the momentum that we see in our business. And last, but not least, we expect to streamline and reduce some of the complexity in the organization that is built up over time in our processes and that's expected to increase our speed, agility and effectiveness in our markets. And I know our organization in particular very much looks forward to this benefit. So, it's a powerful program. I'm glad you asked about it. When we deliver on all elements of it and we will share more in terms of helping with the modeling of it in August. Yeah, no. No, no, go ahead with your second question, Steve. Okay, Steve. So I'll take the first part of that question on the inventory in Asia Travel Retail and Fabrizio will take the Amazon Clinique follow-up question. Regarding the inventory in trade in Asia Travel Retail, we did reach the objectives that we had in the third quarter actually before April. And so the reason that we ended up shifting a bit more from -- or doing a bit more from a replenishment standpoint in the third quarter is because we actually reached those levels a bit earlier than what we had anticipated. We anticipate reaching them by April, which is the beginning of the fourth quarter obviously, and we reached them within the third quarter. So that is the reason why some of the shipments were a bit higher in the third quarter and we will expect the retail sell-through in the fourth quarter. And so \u2013 and as Fabrizio mentioned, we are expecting as well an acceleration of retail in the fourth quarter. Just remember for the cadence of what we're anniversarying we actually had some disruption even in the fourth quarter as it related to Hainan last year. So we are going to see a bit of a disconnect between retail and net for a couple of quarters because of the significance of the interruptions that we had both at the beginning of the third quarter last year and the end of the fourth quarter last year, as well. And so we would expect that net will as we replenish relative to the comparison year-over-year to last year then that would be ahead of retail but we will be maintaining the inventory levels in the range that we and our retailers have agreed to. So, I'll take your last part of the question first. We'll give more guidance on the calendarization of the profit recovery plan in August. We're still -- we're well into the finalization of some of those plans and making taking some decisions within the next couple of months. So, we'll be able to provide you with much better guidance on calendarization in the August time frame."

        "content": "Operator: Good day everyone and welcome to the Est\u00e9e Lauder Company\u2019s fiscal 2024 second quarter conference call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded and webcast.  For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to the Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Rainey Mancini.\nRainey Mancini: Hello. On today\u2019s call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you\u2019ll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements.  To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges and adjustments disclosed in our press release. Unless otherwise stated, all organic net sales growth also excludes the non-comparable impacts of acquisitions, divestitures, brand closures, and the impact of foreign currency translation. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our press release and on the Investors section of our website. As a reminder, references to online sales include sales we make directly to our consumers through our brand.com sites and through third party platforms. It also includes estimated sales of our products through our retailers\u2019 websites. During the Q&A session, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question so we can respond to all of you within the time scheduled for this call. Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Fabrizio.\nFabrizio Freda: Thank you Rainey and hello to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. For the second quarter, we delivered our outlook for organic sales decline of 8% and exceeded expectations for adjusted diluted EPS. Organic sales in our global travel retail business decreased 28% with retail sales trends better than organic performance, reflecting both the execution of our priority to reduce trade inventory in alignment with retailers and efforts by various local authorities to contain structured market activity. We made meaningful progress with trade inventory levels in Asia travel retail and continue to expect to be a normalized trade inventory levels by the end of the third quarter of this fiscal year. The entire rest of our global business decreased 3% organically. This decline was primarily driven by the slow-down of overall prestige beauty in mainland China, although our retail sales trends were much better than our organic performance. Our global retail sales growth excluding travel retail in mainland China rose mid-single digits. The markets of EMEA delivered mid-single digit retail sales growth, and Asia-Pacific excluding mainland China rose double digits, as did Latin America, showcasing strong fundamentals for brand desirability and the success of our consumer engagement initiatives. Encouragingly, we made progress across several strategic priorities in the first half. Beyond reducing inventories of Asia travel retail, we improved working capital, realized higher levels of strategic pricing, and managed expenses with discipline. For the full year, we are revising our outlook as we have tightened the growth range for organic sales primarily to account for risk of macroeconomic volatility in some areas around the world and updated adjusted diluted EPS for an anticipated higher tax rate. In this revised outlook, we have maintained our prior outlook for full year operating profitability. Looking ahead, we are at an inflection point. First, we are positioned to return organic sales growth for the total company in the third quarter, and we expect organic sales growth to sequentially accelerate in the fourth quarter. Second, we are positioned for stronger profitability in the second half of this fiscal year compared to the first half. Third, we are preparing to meaningfully accelerate the rebuild of our profitability in fiscal years 2025 and 2026. Indeed, since we spoke with you in late November, our teams have been actively engaged to operationalize the profit recovery plan. In doing so, we have identified further opportunities to enhance profitability while also generating more resources to be invested in consumer-focused areas to drive long term growth. As a result, we are expanding the profit recovery plan to include a restructuring program. While this is a difficult decision, we believe this now larger plan will better position the company to restore stronger and more sustainable profitability while also supporting sales growth acceleration and increasing agility and speed to market.  For the consumer, we anticipate faster product and commercial innovation supported by strategic brand-building distribution and go-to-market advancement, where digital leadership is at the core. Moreover, we intend to increase our speed and agility as an organization, enabling quicker and more localized decision making to better create and respond to consumer trends.  The profit recovery plan is now expected to deliver incremental operating profit of $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion, up from $800 million to $1 billion previously. In terms of timing, this incremental profit is anticipated to be realized in fiscal year 2025 and \u201926, with more than half in fiscal year 2025. We are confident that our multiple engines of growth strategy will be enhanced by the profit recovery plan, enabling our company to more fully capture promising long term growth opportunities and remain a leader in global prestige beauty, and to reinforce our commitment to execute this larger plan with excellence, we have engaged global consulting firm, Alvarez & Marsal. They will provide strategic advisory services, partnering with us on our restructuring program as part of the profit recovery plan to drive the realization of a sustainable rebuild of profitability. For the second half of the fiscal year, we have strategic initiatives and exciting innovation to drive in North America, re-accelerate growth in mainland China, and drive momentum in markets that are thriving across developed and emerging markets in EMEA, Latin America and Asia-Pacific.  Let me begin with the Clinique brand. The brand will be doubling down on its authentic dermatologist brand heritage of over 55 years, deepening its relationship with the scientific community, strengthening its derma messaging and engaging new consumers. First, Clinique will be dialing up its derma education and consumer communications, including on social media, brand.com and in-store with new dermatologist partnerships and ingredient communication. Clinique has also announced the establishment of the new Mt. Sinai Clinique Healthy Skin Dermatology Center. The Center\u2019s research is expected to produce breakthrough advancement in the study of allergic skin and premature aging. Next month, Clinique will return to the American Academy of Dermatology annual meeting to showcase its derm level science formulations, as well as its unique eye safety promise. All of this is coupled with Clinique\u2019s continued innovation of allergy tested and 100% [indiscernible] products evidenced by Clinique\u2019s new post-procedure relevant claim on powerful products, including Smart Clinical Repair lifting face and neck cr\u00e8me.  Turning to the Est\u00e9e Lauder brand, for over 50 years it has been a pioneer in longevity age reversal research, a frontier of skin biology for its Re-Nutriv luxury franchise. Last August, I spoke with you about how Re-Nutriv should be standing upon its successful Ultimate Diamond Transformative Brilliant Serum with compelling innovation. The franchise breakthrough, Soft Clean with cutting edge patented SIRTIVITY-LP technology for visible age reversal is now launching globally.  In [indiscernible], there is a companion serum cr\u00e8me foundation amplifying the franchise skin longevity science across categories. We are encouraged by the global appeal of this innovation from China to Japan to the U.S. While early, the franchise is welcoming new consumers at compelling rates, and we look forward to all that is to come for Re-Nutriv as launch events continue around the world. Moreover, the brand is collaborating with the Stanford Center of Longevity as the inaugural sponsor of a new program of esthetics and culture.  Beyond Re-Nutriv\u2019s striking innovation, we have more standout launches across brands in the third quarter, led by MAC and Tom Ford. The new MACximal Silky Matte lipstick modernizes the MAC icon with a new silky matte finish, lip conditioning benefits, and elevated packaging. For Tom Ford, Oud Minerale is primed to carry forward the brand\u2019s winning streak of innovation from Caf\u00e9 Rose in the first half. In the second half, we expect these initiatives and new product launches to build upon the strong momentum of several brands. Indeed, The Ordinary, La Mer and Le Labo, among others achieved terrific performance in the second quarter.  The Ordinary delivered an excellent first half as the brand again realized double-digit organic sales growth in the quarter. Its new soothing and barrier support serum, which launched during the first quarter, is the brand\u2019s most successful launch ever and is already among the top 10 ranked products in the U.S. prestige serum category. The Ordinary continue to excel in specialty multi globally and is also realizing very promising uptake on the new Tiktok shop in the United States through engaging live streaming and creator content.  La Mer further contributed to our strong underlying fundamentals in skin care. The brand\u2019s luxurious high quality product from the iconic cr\u00e8me, De La Mer to the new lifting firming serum, along with its exceptional services proved highly sought after by discerning consumers around the world. In mainland China, La Mer grew double digits at retail to realize strong share gains in prestige skin care. Our luxury and our seasonal fragrances also performed quite well. Le Labo led the broad-based trends as Jo Malone London, Tom Ford, Kilian Paris, and Editions de Parfum Frederic Malle each rose organically, fueling double-digit organic sales growth in Asia Pacific and gains in the Americas. For the second half, we expect to return to organic sales growth in mainland China driven by a rich innovation pipeline for a greater contribution to sales from new products in the second half than the first half, and we are investing in exciting go-to-market initiatives across brick and mortar and online.  Impressively, we entered the third quarter in mainland China with momentum in brick and mortar, having expanded our prestige beauty share offline in the second quarter, driven by strong double-digit retail sales growth in each of department stores, specialty multi, and freestanding stores. For online, while the channel was especially pressured by softness in overall prestige beauty and the 11/11 global shopping festival, our brands performed strongly [indiscernible] rising triple digits organically to partially offset lower sales for the event. The Est\u00e9e Lauder brand ranked number one in prestige beauty [indiscernible], and it also ranked number one for store live streaming. For the fiscal year, we remain focused on North America returning to organic sales growth and are encouraged by the low single digit growth delivered in the first half. While makeup was pressured in the second quarter by the cadence of major new product launches, we are very excited by the innovation coming to market across the second half, beginning with MAC\u2019s MACximal Silky Matte lipstick we launched last week. Moreover, skin care grew for the second consecutive quarter in North America, driven by The Ordinary and Est\u00e9e Lauder. Our luxury [indiscernible] fragrances rose double digits in the quarter as our strategic initiative from expanded consumer reach with Kilian Paris to strong engagement on Tiktok by [indiscernible] are proving successful. In closing, we are at an inflection point, poised to return to organic sales growth in the second half and deliver sequentially stronger profitability than the first half, as well as expansion from the year ago. We are well positioned to deliver stronger profitability in fiscal year 2025 and \u201926, given the initial progress we have made from our profit recovery plan as well as its new restructuring program, and we are well positioned to invest in consumer-facing areas to capture exciting growth opportunities in global prestige beauty. I wish to extend my gratitude to our leaders and their amazing teams for the hard work and dedication which has taken us to this inflection point on a renewed sales and profit growth trajectory. I will now turn the call over to Tracey.\nTracey Travis: Thank you Fabrizio, and hello everyone. I\u2019ll start by reviewing our second quarter financial results, followed by a third quarter and full year outlook. I\u2019ll also provide details on our expanded profit recovery plan. As Fabrizio mentioned, our second quarter organic net sales decline of 8% met our expectations. Additionally, through tighter expense management and despite experiencing a higher tax rate due to the shift in our geographical mix of business, our earnings per share of $0.88 exceeded our initial outlook for the quarter.  From a geographic standpoint, organic net sales in our Europe, Middle East and Africa region declined 14%, mainly attributable to the persistent challenges in our Asia travel retail business. The impact from business disruptions in Israel and other parts of the Middle East accounted for a 2% reduction in the region\u2019s overall net sales growth. The markets in the region had mixed results, leading to overall flat growth across all markets. Organic net sales in our Asia-Pacific region fell 7%, reflecting continued challenges in mainland China. While our results on Douyin nearly doubled, our total online sales declined due to softer than expected performance on TMall during the 11.11 event. The overall online performance more than offset the increase in brick and mortar sales, which was led by double-digit growth in our freestanding stores. In the rest of the region, we saw strong organic net sales growth led by double-digit growth in Hong Kong SAR and Korea, as well as high single-digit growth in Japan. Our luxury fragrance brands Le Labo, Jo Malone London, and Tom Ford drove double-digit fragrance growth in the region, which was fueled by both effective commercial activations as well as compelling holiday product offerings.  Organic net sales in the Americas declined 1%, driven by a prior year benefit from changes made to MAC\u2019s take-back loyalty program in North America last year. Excluding this benefit, net sales were relatively flat in North America, reflecting growth in specialty multi and our freestanding stores and offset by softer performance experienced in department stores and online. In Latin America, organic net sales rose double digits, reflecting continued growth in nearly every market and strong performance during holiday and key shopping moments.  From a category standpoint, organic net sales fell 10% in skincare and 8% in makeup. In skincare, the ongoing challenges in Asia travel retail and mainland China drove the majority of the decrease. Organic net sales from The Ordinary and La Mer grew across every geographic region. The Ordinary saw double-digit growth in specialty multi, including ongoing expansion, and continued its focus on education-first content to drive successful social media activations. Net sales from La Mer increased both online and in brick and mortar, benefiting from captivating social media and holiday product activations. In makeup, the persistent challenges in Asia travel retail were compounded by the prior year benefit from MAC that I previously mentioned. Organic net sales fell 6% in hair care and were flat in fragrance. Net sales from La Labo grew double digits, fueled by both targeted expanded consumer reach and same store sales. The brand\u2019s ethos and high touch services persistently attract both new and loyal consumers, as evidenced by the double-digit net sales growth in our freestanding stores as well as strong performance during holiday and key shopping moments. For Jo Malone London, results from the brand\u2019s holiday collection were strong and net sales increased in nearly all channels of distribution. This growth was offset by a decline from Est\u00e9e Lauder due to the timing of holiday shipments compared to last year. Our gross margin decreased 60 basis points compared to last year. The positive impacts from brand mix and net strategic pricing actions were more than offset by higher costs due to promotional items and foreign currency.  Operating expenses increased 260 basis points as a percent of sales, driven largely by the reduction in sales. Selling, advertising and promotional activities and innovation collectively accounted for 160 basis points of the increase compared to last year as we supported retail growth while also continuing to destock certain accounts in Asia travel retail. Operating income declined 25% to $577 million, and our operating margin contracted to 13.5% from 16.6% in the prior year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 37.7% compared to 24.9% last year. The increase in rate was primarily due to a true-up in the quarter to reflect the now higher estimated tax rate on our foreign operations for fiscal 2024 as a result of the change in our geographical mix of earnings. This also reflects an unfavorable impact related to previously issued share-based compensation. Diluted EPS of $0.88 decreased 43% compared to last year, including a dilutive impact of $0.19 from the change in the effective tax rate. The impact from business disruptions in Israel and other parts of the Middle East was $0.02 dilutive to EPS in the quarter. The acquisition of the Tom Ford brand was neutral to EPS as interest expense related to our debt financing was offset by the combined benefits derived as the licensor of the brand from royalty revenue this year and savings from no longer having to pay licensee royalties.  During the quarter, we generated $937 million in net cash flow from operating activities compared to $751 million last year. The increase from last year reflects lower working capital partially offset by the decline in net earnings. The favorability from working capital was largely due to the actions we have taken to reduce inventory, primarily finished goods and semi-finished goods, that resulted in a significant improvement in our days to sell. We invested $527 million in capital expenditures and we returned $474 million in cash to stockholders through dividends. Turning now to our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2024, which excludes the impact from the remaining payment for the outstanding Decium equity anticipated to occur in May 2024 and includes Clinique\u2019s heightened focus in active derma, while we delivered on our Q2 expectations, we are lowering the high end of our fiscal \u201924 organic net sales outlook range to reflect continued risks from evolving macroeconomic volatility and geopolitical tensions in certain areas around the world. Despite this change to our sales outlook, we are maintaining our full year operating profitability expectation. Furthermore, we are updating our EPS outlook primarily to reflect the increase in our estimated full year effective tax rate, largely due to the anticipated geographical mix of our earnings. This is expected to more than offset the EPS benefit from foreign currency translation. Using December 29 spot rates of 1.107 for the euro, 1.273 for the pound, 7.109 for the Chinese yuan and 12.90 for the Korean yuan, currency translation is anticipated to negatively impact reported sales for the third quarter and diluted EPS for both the third quarter and the full year.  We expect organic net sales for our third quarter to increase 3% to 5% as both our businesses in Asia travel retail and in mainland China are expected to return to growth. In Asia travel retail, this growth assumes the continued reduction in retailer inventory as well as the anniversary of some business disruptions we experienced last year. Currency translation and the potential risks of further business disruptions in the Middle East are each expected to be dilutive to reported net sales by one point. We expect third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.36 to $0.46, for a decrease between 3% to 24%. Currency translation and the potential risk of further business disruptions in the Middle East are each expected to dilute EPS by $0.03. Adjusted EPS in constant currency is expected to range between an increase of 3% to a decline of 18%. For the full year, we expect reported and organic net sales to range between a decline of 1% and an increase of 1%.  Our plants have been running at reduced capacity, reflecting the pull-down of production in line with our lower shipments and to support the reduction of inventory levels both in-house and in the trade. This has resulted in inefficiencies in some of our manufacturing locations and may trigger a requirement to recognize the related manufacturing costs as in-period costs instead of when products are sold. We have reflected this potential expense and the corresponding pressure to gross margin in our outlook for the balance of the fiscal year, primarily in the third quarter. Our full year operating margin outlook remains unchanged and is expected to be between 9% and 9.5%, a contraction from 11.4% last year, and planned to partially offset the incremental pressure to gross margin through disciplined expense management. We now expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 35% compared to 26.5% last year. The increase reflects a larger mix of our expected fiscal 2024 earnings in higher tax jurisdictions as well as the unfavorable impact of previously issued share-based compensation.  Diluted EPS is expected to range between $2.08 and $2.23 before restructuring and other charges. The potential risks of further business disruptions in Israel and other parts of the Middle East and currency translation are expected to dilute earnings per share by $0.08 and $0.07 respectively. In constant currency, we expect EPS to fall between 34% to 38%. Given the progress we have made in strategic initiatives the first half of the year, we expect to return to organic net sales growth and stronger operating profitability in the second half.  In November, we announced a profit recovery plan to support the progressive rebuilding of our profit margins in fiscal years 2025 and 2026. Today with the announcement of a two-year restructuring program, we have further expanded this plan. As Fabrizio mentioned, we are focused on strategically leveraging our strengths to accelerate our return to more sustainable profitable growth while elevating our consumer activations and increasing our operating agility. The restructuring program is designed to right-size and streamline select areas within our organization, which unfortunately necessitates us making the difficult decision of an expected net reduction in positions globally of 3% to 5%.  The restructuring program is expected to begin in the third quarter and continue for the duration of the profit recovery plan. We expect to take charges of between $500 million and $700 million and generate annual gross savings of $350 million to $500 million before taxes. A portion of these savings is expected to be reinvested in consumer-facing activities to drive long term sustainable profitable growth. We now expect to drive incremental operating profit through all initiatives under the profit recovery plan of $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion, inclusive of net benefits from the restructuring program announced today. The plan is expected to yield almost all of the anticipated benefits by the end of fiscal year 2026, with slightly more than half of these benefits realized and contributing to operating profitability in fiscal 2025. In closing, we express our sincere gratitude to our teams around the world as they work tirelessly to execute against our priorities and drive our business forward. We believe that with the work that is being done to position us to return to growth in the second half of the fiscal year and beyond, and with the successful execution of our expanded profit recovery plan, we will be better positioned to return our company to long term sustainable growth and profitability. That concludes our prepared remarks. We\u2019ll be happy to take your questions at this time.\nOperator: The floor is now open for questions. [Operator instructions] Our first question today comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nDara Mohsenian: Hey, good morning guys. First, just a couple clarification questions under the restructuring and profit recovery program. Could you just give a little more detail on the structural changes in the program beyond the job cuts, and in the past, you\u2019ve done a pretty good job of delivering upside to savings goals, so how do you think about other savings areas that could potentially emerge over time and are you pushing beyond what\u2019s potentially announced? Then if you\u2019ll be generous enough to entertain a question on China, I think clearly there are some structural changes that have emerged in China beauty - the consumer perception of the category itself, willingness to be ostentatious, etc., changes in daigou selling, promotional impacts, mass brand performance. There have been impacts to Est\u00e9e brand share, so maybe Fabrizio, just take a step back and broad thoughts on the opportunity in China from here, but also specifically how do you adjust to these changes, what are your focus points from here in this new China reality? That\u2019d be helpful, thanks.\nTracey Travis: Dara, I\u2019ll start with your question on the profit recovery plan. What we shared in November was our primary focus of the plan is to rebuild our gross margin, which is where we\u2019ve lost, as you all know, quite a bit of margin. Some of the strategies that we spoke about at that time that we were putting in place is really to focus on more profitable channel mix, to get our inventories under control, which should improve our obsolescence as well as some of the discounting that has gone on over the last few years.  We are being more granular in terms of some of the strategic pricing initiatives that we have, and we also talked at that time about from an expense standpoint, implementing an incremental indirect procurement program to reduce some of our expense areas, so those were some of the initiatives that we spoke about that made up the $800 million to a billion in terms of the profit recovery plan at that time, and then obviously we\u2019ve announced an additional element to the program with the restructuring. On China?\nFabrizio Freda: Yes, so on the China question, first of all, we had some soft consumer sentiment in the recent period that drove this lower prestige sales growth. However, first of all, we remain very optimistic about the long term opportunity in China and continue to invest for growth. The second point is you asked about the brand health and what\u2019s changing. Our brands are really, really strong. The retail sales growth has been much better than the net growth, and have been extraordinary, double-digit growth on many of our brands, particularly in luxury, like La Mer, Tom Ford, Jo Malone, Bobbi Brown, Kilian, Frederic Malle and Aveda, also Le Labo continues to track. In terms of market share, importantly we gained market share over the fiscal year in quarter two, despite there was a small reduction from market share in quarter two, but we gained market share in skin care category 80 points, we gained in fragrances, we gained in healthcare, and there are several important of our--many of our brands, we had really top ranks in 11.11.  Another element to support the strength of our equity is the freestanding store double-digit growth both in total and in live doors in mainland China, and I should also mention the strength in Hong Kong, where we grew substantial market share, in part reflecting success with the Chinese consumers.  Where we go from here? As I said, we are going to continue to invest in China and we believe we have a great team there and determination to continue building market share, winning in the long term. The first step is building our distribution in winning online channels, that this will continue, particularly accelerating the win in the short term, and continue to build market share in new cities in brick and mortar, where I would like to underline is in quarter two, we grew substantial brick and mortar market share in China. We\u2019ll also continue to leverage our current trend where retail sales [indiscernible] and we will support very strong holiday plans, which as you know, there is a high concentration of sales in China during the various holiday plans in the course of a year.  We also believe that there is a particularly strong opportunity in the luxury area, around our luxury brands, which as I said are doing very well, and I\u2019m referring to Est\u00e9e Lauder Re-Nutriv launch that we mentioned in the prepared remarks. La Mer, Tom Ford, Le Labo, Bobbi Brown have extraordinary aggressive plans. Strong innovation plans in H2, by the way, will continue and will accelerate, leveraging the new laboratory in Shanghai, which is an important opportunity for us. It is important--you asked what is changing in the various other aspects, so in the relationship with travel retail and in the managing of the overall pricing and promotions across the China consumer framework, we have dramatically improved the model or the process between the China team and the PR team in making decisions about promotionality, pricing, channel prioritization, and this is working better and better for the future.  Also about the development of local brands, for the moment they are mainly in mass. We completely acknowledge there will be a continuous development of local brands, and the strength of our innovation and the differentiation of our brands is going to be key, and so we\u2019ll continue to invest in this [indiscernible] and in the strengths. The investment in our local lab, that will develop a lot of local innovation, is part of the answer to how to compete in this evolving environment as well. Last, we are shortening the supply chain with a factory in Asia Pacific and the ability to plan more accordingly to demand, and to be more agile in responding to demand is the added big capability that will increase the flexibility, the agility of our China team in following demand.  Net, we have a strong business in China, we have strong market share, and we are determined to continue to invest for the long term in China.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nBryan Spillane: Thank you Operator. Good morning Fabrizio and Tracey. My question is just related to maybe how you\u2019re going to measure yourself as an organization over the next two years, so the \u201925 to \u201926 time frame, and I guess I ask that in the context of stock clearly today reflecting an inflection, right - a positive inflection, but at the same time, there\u2019s a lot of mix things, right? China, slower than it was, but again optimistic for the long term. You\u2019ve got a lot of work to do underneath the hood, right, to execute on the restructuring program and improve margins. I guess I\u2019m just curious how you\u2019re thinking about how linear this improvement would be, and again, are you going to change the way you\u2019re going to maybe measure yourself in the near term, just given how much work you\u2019ve got to do and maybe how different it was versus business as normal over the last couple of years. Thanks.\nFabrizio Freda: Yes, absolutely. Your question gives me the opportunity to give an overview of what we are trying to do. I hope you realize that the work we have done in the last several months culminates today in what we define as an inflection point. It\u2019s first of all acknowledging the need of some important changes to align to the future opportunity to address our key pressure points developed in this post-COVID environment, so I\u2019d like to summarize first of all what we are doing, and then I will measure ourselves. The way we look at it is that, first of all, we are addressing the need to change and we are addressing the key pressure points. The first is the meaningful progress we have done on retail stocks in Asia, that as we said as of April, they should be aligned, and this will determine the ability to align in the future retail and net in this very important channel for us and for the industry in general. That\u2019s a big pressure point that we are addressing. The second, the part that was driving margin was obviously the need of gross margin, addressing our gross margin, addressing our cost structure, and right-size our organization, and so the profit recovery plan enlarged and the execution of it, which is strongly advanced, and the additional restructuring are addressing decisively our ability to recover profitability at an accelerated pace.  At the same time, this profit recovery plan is designed to resource our future growth plans more aggressively and to develop the right agility and speed to market in the organization, and we are going to measure this and to measures ourselves on that. For agility, I mean agility to allocate resources in this more volatile world more promptly and faster, as the one, for example, supply chain I just mentioned in the previous question, and the speed to market of innovation to better compete with local brands. The other important part of profitability and margin was skin care, and obviously we need to recover our skin care growth to address the profitability, as we discussed several times. I just want to clarify that the skin care growth during quarter two was very strong in the Americas, in EMEA, in APAC ex-China. In China, we didn\u2019t grow skin care during quarter two, but we grew market share of skin care, as I said before, in a very strong way.  We are addressing the skin care opportunity and the innovation of skin care that we are announcing, the one on Est\u00e9e Lauder, De La Mer Fresh, De La Mer future innovation, the Clinique repositioning, [indiscernible] leveraging its heavy touch position, the The Ordinary activation and future of The Ordinary globally, all these are engines that should continue to grow also in the long term our skin care, now that [indiscernible] the retail stocks in [indiscernible] will build. That\u2019s the first big pressure point that we address.  The second was the China growth and the China focus in the long term. I believe I addressed this in my previous answer. The third one is accelerating our plan to stabilize market share in the U.S., and we are addressing this, first of all, attacking very clearly our opportunity in active derm with the Clinique heritage position and with The Ordinary\u2019s extraordinary success. We will continue to address our distribution mix improvement needs toward the consumer growth segment and the channel segment. We are accelerating our fragrance sales growth, which is very important in the region, and also would like to remind that we have the top two brands in skin care and in makeup in the region, and in skin care with the arrival and the growth of The Ordinary, now we have four of the top five skincare brands in the market and The Ordinary gained 200 points of share in the prestige market just in quarter two. We are addressing very decisively the future opportunities of this in North America. So a second point is we want to continue building on our strengths, and we said that we have strengths clearly in APAC ex-China at this moment with the comeback of Hong Kong, with a very important improvement versus the COVID period. In EMEA, we continue to have strong growth, for example in skincare and in markets in Germany, Italy, Spain, Turkey. Our emerging markets grew mid-double digits, and we believe we have a strong opportunity in emerging markets, where we have very strong market share position in every one of the top ones for the future acceleration. Our direct-to-consumer business, our freestanding stores grew double digits, supporting also our brand strength in equity, so we will continue building on all these strengths and our plans focus on this. We remain confident in the future of the prestige beauty market, so there remains very attractive--we remain focused as a pure player on these very high growth [indiscernible] market in the consumer goods industry, and finally, as I said, the profit recovery plan and the restructuring will be a key enabler of all these strategies in our future. So yes, we see that we are at an inflection point and that we are going to measure ourselves on all these elements combined, meaning we are going to measure ourselves with the pace of recovery of our profitability, with going back to a growth--sustainable growth model and investing in our brands for the future, and re-addressing the needed changes in our organization to improve agility of resource allocation and speed to market. \nOperator: The next question comes from Olivia Tong with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nOlivia Tong: Great, thanks. I wanted to talk a little about, just first, a follow-up on your U.S. distribution comments in terms of stabilizing U.S. share. With Clinique and The Ordinary sort of towards the entry level price point in prestige, how do you think about further diversification in U.S. distribution, especially as department store exposure continues to come down? Thanks. \nFabrizio Freda: As you know, we are working on this for some time, and the way we address it is that we are going to continue to increase the focus on high growth channels. We have done some extraordinary improvement in the specialty channel in the last year, and that will continue to be our focus. We are also obviously focusing our support to our department store partners where we have high market share, and we are managing this business carefully, and we are continuing to accelerate online with various opportunities that we have in this world, and the consumer is shopping more and more omnichannel, and so we are going to continue to put focus on the opportunity of omnichannel growth that we have in the United States. That\u2019s what we are doing, and you will see this strategy to be implemented step by step in the next 12 months, accordingly, to these opportunities.\nOperator: The next question comes from Oliver Chen with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nOliver Chen: Hi Fabrizio and Tracey. You mentioned agility many times. What are your thoughts on the priorities in terms of what you\u2019ll do there, as well as direct-to-consumer and digital? Community engagement, as you know, is very important in terms of user-generated content and making sure to embrace a lot of new formats. A follow-up - as we model inventory in the back half, your inventories are in much better shape, but what gives you the conviction that the inventory levels related to Asia travel retail will be healthy in terms of the back half? Just some key aspects and being more confident there. Thanks a lot.\nTracey Travis: Thanks Oliver. I\u2019ll start with the inventory levels.  You know, we\u2019ve made significant progress, as we said in our prepared remarks, on inventory and bringing down the levels of inventory in the trade that were high in pockets of Asia travel retail. We are pretty comfortable that we will be able to bring those down to levels that are healthier, that are expected to drive regular replenishment levels and therefore be the net sales accelerator that we have embedded in our guidance for the second half of the year. In addition, what we spoke about is we\u2019ve also, at the same time of bringing down inventory levels in the trade, brought inventory levels down in-house, and that is part of the benefit that we saw in terms of the cash improvement in the quarter, and we expect with the tools that we\u2019ve invested in and having healthier levels of inventory overall, largely driven by the pull down in production that we did in the first quarter that we spoke about, that we are going to be in much better shape as we support some of the upcoming innovation that we have, as well as in the future in terms of bringing inventory levels into better control.  Obviously the investment that we\u2019ve done, as Fabrizio mentioned, in our Asia supply chain allows us to have shorter lead times in the region and be able to better manage any volatility that may occur in the future, now that we have a plant and an R&D center in the region, so all of those things help us in terms of creating better inventory agility, being able to produce faster to market demand than we have been in the past.\nFabrizio Freda: Then your question in agility, there are two measures of agility that we look at as very important. One is agility in responding to volatility faster in reallocating resources, so the action in this area has been the shortening of our supply chain in Asia, for example, and the various aspects--even the way we are repositioned. We are leveraging the historical heritage position of Clinique and doubling down on it in active derma, the way we are leveraging The Ordinary strength in active derma, so in other words how we are responding to the consumer trend of active derma now very decisively, so those are elements of agility. We want to improve our ability to do these things faster and more promptly in the future. The other aspect of the agility is the way we go to market, so reaction to, for example, the new platforms. We are learning how to operate with Tiktok globally; much more, we are focusing on earned media value much more our organization, including resource allocation but also the training and the development and the understanding of the various models. We are doing this is all markets for the world at the same time. We are modernizing our promotional models and making them more relevant to the current consumer trends, and importantly as an umbrella concept, we are becoming more and more able to react to trends. There are two kinds of trends we are working our organizational development on. The first is the long term trends, the fundamental changes in consumer preferences, where frankly we have been always pretty strong, and we are further refining these abilities. Then there are the short term trends, the trends that can change in a week, in a month of what\u2019s going to be popular online in a certain country, in a certain moment, where we have developed better and better models to react to short term trends with our brands, with our execution, with our resource allocation. And by the way, the work on organization of the profit recovery plan is also pillared to improve our ability in both these areas, meaning the agility in resource allocation and the agility in reacting to trends and to the new models of marketing around the world.\nOperator: The next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Please go ahead.\nDana Telsey: Hi, good morning Fabrizio and Tracey. As you think about pricing and the new launches that you have coming, how do you think about pricing both for existing hero and new products and how it\u2019s changing? Then as you continue to enhance the specialty multi distribution, how do you see engaging with the department stores and what that relevance--how that relevance changes? Thank you.\nTracey Travis: We have a pretty sophisticated, Dana, pricing model for new product launches, and I think we had spoken about it even under the profit recovery plan, making sure that our new product launches actually are accretive to our overall margin, so we have actually cut some of our new product launches that were planned for fiscal \u201925 in order to do that, and re-looked at our innovation pipeline to make sure that what we are launching is in fact accretive. But the sophistication that goes into our new product pricing model in terms of looking at what the competitive benchmarks are relative to that particular launch, also from a market standpoint, making sure again that the new product is positioned appropriately, we look at if it\u2019s replacing an existing franchise, measure the product and pricing differentials related to added content, added benefits, added packaging, etc., so there are a number of things that factor into it.  I think that as we mentioned, we\u2019ve got some very exciting new product launches in the second half of this year. MAC is re-launching two of their largest franchises, Studio FX and the MAC lipstick. We\u2019ve got Est\u00e9e Lauder Re-Nutriv with SIRTIVITY that is quite exciting, really playing on the longevity focus that is accelerating in the market. Fabrizio just talked about trends - we\u2019ve got quite a bit of trend-based but highly efficacious from a quality standpoint, products launching in the second half of the year, all of which have been priced appropriately for the benefits that they are contributing.\nFabrizio Freda: Yes, and on the different retailers, the retail channels, we obviously support every one of the retail channels, so specialty multi, department store. Every retail channel is going to be supported more and more in a tailored way, meaning tailoring to their model, to their strategy, to their specific consumer profiles, and this will be very different country by country. There are countries where certain channels grow faster than others and maybe the opposite happens in other countries, so it\u2019s not about their preferences are changing, the strategy is about tailoring the strategy to each channel, supporting every one of our customers. At the end, the result of this is that the mix of our business in every country of the world will be focused on growth. It will be focused and leveraging the channels that the consumer is in that specific moment we choose, or the different target of consumer we choose in every channel, so it\u2019s about tailoring to all the opportunities wherever they are.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nSteve Powers: Hey, thank you and good morning. Back to the profit recovery plan, I think your outlook today at the midpoint implies roughly $1.5 billion or so of operating profit in fiscal \u201923, and you frame the recovery program as incremental profit from here, which assuming the benefits are all off a fiscal \u201924 base, that implies $2.5 billion to $3 billion or so of operating profit in fiscal \u201926, and I think that\u2019s before considering presumed underlying growth in the business over those next couple of years. \nTracey Travis: That\u2019s correct.\nSteve Powers: Okay, great. I guess the question is how do you protect--against that objective you\u2019re saying today, how do you protect against those incremental profits being essentially countered by incremental investments that emerge over that time, because you\u2019re seeing the expectation for investors today that the profit comes, it\u2019s a pretty firm objective, but how do you guard against other costs creeping into the model over the next couple of years?\nTracey Travis: It\u2019s a great question, Steve. Look - we are certainly realistic that with regulatory changes, with what happens with inflation, there are a lot of things that we, in the base business before the profit recovery plan, need to be able to manage, and one of the things that we are working through with our organization is how do you make those choices in terms of what to invest and dis-invest in, in terms of the base business, so those are areas that we are keenly focused on as we look at just what the base progression, which you\u2019re very familiar with what our normal progression is, outside of obviously this unusual period of post-pandemic disruption that we\u2019ve experienced, so. We certainly have in the past been able to do that and believe that we can do it in the future as well.  We\u2019ve also stood up a very disciplined and strong project management office in order to be able to track all of the savings that we are committing to, and also obviously with the base business, making sure that we\u2019re meeting our normal base expectations as it relates to regular growth and margin expansion.\nFabrizio Freda: I\u2019d just like to add one point, is that as you said, the $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion being defined as extra profitability, which means that the reinvestment part in building our brands and accelerating growth comes from more savings than what we define as extra profit, so to be fair, there will be more savings. Some of them will be reinvested in consumer-facing growth acceleration, and the $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion is our target for extra profitability, and that\u2019s why we have been very clear on that. The investment in growth that will be done, or the extra investment in growth for the future that we want to develop capabilities for, are for consumer-facing. We are not planning to invest in many new capabilities; rather, we want to leverage the capabilities we have built in the last period in a very efficient way, so that\u2019s the way to think, I believe, about the profit recovery plan.\nOperator: Our last question today comes from Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nLauren Lieberman: Great, thanks. Good morning. Two things I wanted to touch on. The first was just, I think during the prepared remarks, you commented that retail sales ex-China and travel retail are up mid-singles, but organic also excluding those things was down 3, so. I know you\u2019ve spoken very explicitly about the inventory dynamics in Asia travel retail, but I was just curious about inventory dynamics outside of those markets and why that disconnect was that large. That was question one. Then question two is just on the go-forward plan around unstructured markets across Asia. Of course we all know there\u2019s been regulatory change in China and Hainan, but you\u2019ve spoken many times in the past, Fabrizio, about how that market tends to shift and move with the travelers and currency and all sorts of things that can impact where it\u2019s taking place, so was curious on your thoughts about that unstructured market going forward, what you are or aren\u2019t going to do in terms of regulating the degree of participation, because I think it has a lot to do with how we should be thinking about and modeling the absolute size of the travel retail business in dollar terms as we look out over the next several years. Thanks. \nTracey Travis: Thanks Lauren, I\u2019ll start with the retail and organic. You know, when we have--especially in the second quarter, obviously when we have big events like 11.11, and you have holiday and in the case--you know, for us, when those events don\u2019t go as well as expected, obviously retailers pull back on and we pull back on some of the shipments that we have to those retailers, in order to bring things back in line, so you will see from a quarter to quarter standpoint, there may be some disconnects related to that, but it averages out over the course of a year, so we don\u2019t have any issues in any other markets like what we have been experiencing in Asia travel retail for you all to be concerned about.\nFabrizio Freda: On the unstructured market, our focus is on travelers and travelers converting, and that is getting better and better around the world, just to be clear, apart from the China situation that we have discussed many times. In the rest of the world, there is extraordinary progress in this area, double digits, in some cases triple digits in every market of the world, so this will happen more and more, also in China, also in Korea, and also in the part which has been the slowest to recover in that direction. So first part of the answer is the focus to continue growing in travelers and continuously improving the travelers\u2019 conversion. As we are seeing from the data of the market, the travelers has been improving very, very nicely, but the conversion of the travelers for the moment is below expectations. The unstructured market as such is reducing, and I want to say it\u2019s reducing also for regulations for the intentions of the government, so the retailers, so there is a trend to reduce the amount, and obviously this is also what we are doing, and so the way you should expect is that the unstructured market will be reduced, in my opinion will reduce also as a market, but will be reducing for us. It will be reducing in a gradual way as the travelers improve and increase over time. \nOperator: That concludes today\u2019s question and answer session.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Fabrizio Freda",
            "content": "Thank you Rainey and hello to everyone. We appreciate you joining us today. For the second quarter, we delivered our outlook for organic sales decline of 8% and exceeded expectations for adjusted diluted EPS. Organic sales in our global travel retail business decreased 28% with retail sales trends better than organic performance, reflecting both the execution of our priority to reduce trade inventory in alignment with retailers and efforts by various local authorities to contain structured market activity. We made meaningful progress with trade inventory levels in Asia travel retail and continue to expect to be a normalized trade inventory levels by the end of the third quarter of this fiscal year. The entire rest of our global business decreased 3% organically. This decline was primarily driven by the slow-down of overall prestige beauty in mainland China, although our retail sales trends were much better than our organic performance. Our global retail sales growth excluding travel retail in mainland China rose mid-single digits. The markets of EMEA delivered mid-single digit retail sales growth, and Asia-Pacific excluding mainland China rose double digits, as did Latin America, showcasing strong fundamentals for brand desirability and the success of our consumer engagement initiatives. Encouragingly, we made progress across several strategic priorities in the first half. Beyond reducing inventories of Asia travel retail, we improved working capital, realized higher levels of strategic pricing, and managed expenses with discipline. For the full year, we are revising our outlook as we have tightened the growth range for organic sales primarily to account for risk of macroeconomic volatility in some areas around the world and updated adjusted diluted EPS for an anticipated higher tax rate. In this revised outlook, we have maintained our prior outlook for full year operating profitability. Looking ahead, we are at an inflection point. First, we are positioned to return organic sales growth for the total company in the third quarter, and we expect organic sales growth to sequentially accelerate in the fourth quarter. Second, we are positioned for stronger profitability in the second half of this fiscal year compared to the first half. Third, we are preparing to meaningfully accelerate the rebuild of our profitability in fiscal years 2025 and 2026. Indeed, since we spoke with you in late November, our teams have been actively engaged to operationalize the profit recovery plan. In doing so, we have identified further opportunities to enhance profitability while also generating more resources to be invested in consumer-focused areas to drive long term growth. As a result, we are expanding the profit recovery plan to include a restructuring program. While this is a difficult decision, we believe this now larger plan will better position the company to restore stronger and more sustainable profitability while also supporting sales growth acceleration and increasing agility and speed to market.  For the consumer, we anticipate faster product and commercial innovation supported by strategic brand-building distribution and go-to-market advancement, where digital leadership is at the core. Moreover, we intend to increase our speed and agility as an organization, enabling quicker and more localized decision making to better create and respond to consumer trends.  The profit recovery plan is now expected to deliver incremental operating profit of $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion, up from $800 million to $1 billion previously. In terms of timing, this incremental profit is anticipated to be realized in fiscal year 2025 and '26, with more than half in fiscal year 2025. We are confident that our multiple engines of growth strategy will be enhanced by the profit recovery plan, enabling our company to more fully capture promising long term growth opportunities and remain a leader in global prestige beauty, and to reinforce our commitment to execute this larger plan with excellence, we have engaged global consulting firm, Alvarez & Marsal. They will provide strategic advisory services, partnering with us on our restructuring program as part of the profit recovery plan to drive the realization of a sustainable rebuild of profitability. For the second half of the fiscal year, we have strategic initiatives and exciting innovation to drive in North America, re-accelerate growth in mainland China, and drive momentum in markets that are thriving across developed and emerging markets in EMEA, Latin America and Asia-Pacific.  Let me begin with the Clinique brand. The brand will be doubling down on its authentic dermatologist brand heritage of over 55 years, deepening its relationship with the scientific community, strengthening its derma messaging and engaging new consumers. First, Clinique will be dialing up its derma education and consumer communications, including on social media, brand.com and in-store with new dermatologist partnerships and ingredient communication. Clinique has also announced the establishment of the new Mt. Sinai Clinique Healthy Skin Dermatology Center. The Center's research is expected to produce breakthrough advancement in the study of allergic skin and premature aging. Next month, Clinique will return to the American Academy of Dermatology annual meeting to showcase its derm level science formulations, as well as its unique eye safety promise. All of this is coupled with Clinique's continued innovation of allergy tested and 100% [indiscernible] products evidenced by Clinique's new post-procedure relevant claim on powerful products, including Smart Clinical Repair lifting face and neck cre\u0300me.  Turning to the Este\u0301e Lauder brand, for over 50 years it has been a pioneer in longevity age reversal research, a frontier of skin biology for its Re-Nutriv luxury franchise. Last August, I spoke with you about how Re-Nutriv should be standing upon its successful Ultimate Diamond Transformative Brilliant Serum with compelling innovation. The franchise breakthrough, Soft Clean with cutting edge patented SIRTIVITY-LP technology for visible age reversal is now launching globally.  In [indiscernible], there is a companion serum cre\u0300me foundation amplifying the franchise skin longevity science across categories. We are encouraged by the global appeal of this innovation from China to Japan to the U.S. While early, the franchise is welcoming new consumers at compelling rates, and we look forward to all that is to come for Re-Nutriv as launch events continue around the world. Moreover, the brand is collaborating with the Stanford Center of Longevity as the inaugural sponsor of a new program of esthetics and culture.  Beyond Re-Nutriv's striking innovation, we have more standout launches across brands in the third quarter, led by MAC and Tom Ford. The new MACximal Silky Matte lipstick modernizes the MAC icon with a new silky matte finish, lip conditioning benefits, and elevated packaging. For Tom Ford, Oud Minerale is primed to carry forward the brand's winning streak of innovation from Cafe\u0301 Rose in the first half. In the second half, we expect these initiatives and new product launches to build upon the strong momentum of several brands. Indeed, The Ordinary, La Mer and Le Labo, among others achieved terrific performance in the second quarter.  The Ordinary delivered an excellent first half as the brand again realized double-digit organic sales growth in the quarter. Its new soothing and barrier support serum, which launched during the first quarter, is the brand's most successful launch ever and is already among the top 10 ranked products in the U.S. prestige serum category. The Ordinary continue to excel in specialty multi globally and is also realizing very promising uptake on the new Tiktok shop in the United States through engaging live streaming and creator content.  La Mer further contributed to our strong underlying fundamentals in skin care. The brand's luxurious high quality product from the iconic cre\u0300me, De La Mer to the new lifting firming serum, along with its exceptional services proved highly sought after by discerning consumers around the world. In mainland China, La Mer grew double digits at retail to realize strong share gains in prestige skin care. Our luxury and our seasonal fragrances also performed quite well. Le Labo led the broad-based trends as Jo Malone London, Tom Ford, Kilian Paris, and Editions de Parfum Frederic Malle each rose organically, fueling double-digit organic sales growth in Asia Pacific and gains in the Americas. For the second half, we expect to return to organic sales growth in mainland China driven by a rich innovation pipeline for a greater contribution to sales from new products in the second half than the first half, and we are investing in exciting go-to-market initiatives across brick and mortar and online.  Impressively, we entered the third quarter in mainland China with momentum in brick and mortar, having expanded our prestige beauty share offline in the second quarter, driven by strong double-digit retail sales growth in each of department stores, specialty multi, and freestanding stores. For online, while the channel was especially pressured by softness in overall prestige beauty and the 11/11 global shopping festival, our brands performed strongly [indiscernible] rising triple digits organically to partially offset lower sales for the event. The Este\u0301e Lauder brand ranked number one in prestige beauty [indiscernible], and it also ranked number one for store live streaming. For the fiscal year, we remain focused on North America returning to organic sales growth and are encouraged by the low single digit growth delivered in the first half. While makeup was pressured in the second quarter by the cadence of major new product launches, we are very excited by the innovation coming to market across the second half, beginning with MAC's MACximal Silky Matte lipstick we launched last week. Moreover, skin care grew for the second consecutive quarter in North America, driven by The Ordinary and Este\u0301e Lauder. Our luxury [indiscernible] fragrances rose double digits in the quarter as our strategic initiative from expanded consumer reach with Kilian Paris to strong engagement on Tiktok by [indiscernible] are proving successful. In closing, we are at an inflection point, poised to return to organic sales growth in the second half and deliver sequentially stronger profitability than the first half, as well as expansion from the year ago. We are well positioned to deliver stronger profitability in fiscal year 2025 and '26, given the initial progress we have made from our profit recovery plan as well as its new restructuring program, and we are well positioned to invest in consumer-facing areas to capture exciting growth opportunities in global prestige beauty. I wish to extend my gratitude to our leaders and their amazing teams for the hard work and dedication which has taken us to this inflection point on a renewed sales and profit growth trajectory. I will now turn the call over to Tracey. Yes, so on the China question, first of all, we had some soft consumer sentiment in the recent period that drove this lower prestige sales growth. However, first of all, we remain very optimistic about the long term opportunity in China and continue to invest for growth. The second point is you asked about the brand health and what's changing. Our brands are really, really strong. The retail sales growth has been much better than the net growth, and have been extraordinary, double-digit growth on many of our brands, particularly in luxury, like La Mer, Tom Ford, Jo Malone, Bobbi Brown, Kilian, Frederic Malle and Aveda, also Le Labo continues to track. In terms of market share, importantly we gained market share over the fiscal year in quarter two, despite there was a small reduction from market share in quarter two, but we gained market share in skin care category 80 points, we gained in fragrances, we gained in healthcare, and there are several important of our--many of our brands, we had really top ranks in 11.11.  Another element to support the strength of our equity is the freestanding store double-digit growth both in total and in live doors in mainland China, and I should also mention the strength in Hong Kong, where we grew substantial market share, in part reflecting success with the Chinese consumers.  Where we go from here? As I said, we are going to continue to invest in China and we believe we have a great team there and determination to continue building market share, winning in the long term. The first step is building our distribution in winning online channels, that this will continue, particularly accelerating the win in the short term, and continue to build market share in new cities in brick and mortar, where I would like to underline is in quarter two, we grew substantial brick and mortar market share in China. We'll also continue to leverage our current trend where retail sales [indiscernible] and we will support very strong holiday plans, which as you know, there is a high concentration of sales in China during the various holiday plans in the course of a year.  We also believe that there is a particularly strong opportunity in the luxury area, around our luxury brands, which as I said are doing very well, and I'm referring to Este\u0301e Lauder Re-Nutriv launch that we mentioned in the prepared remarks. La Mer, Tom Ford, Le Labo, Bobbi Brown have extraordinary aggressive plans. Strong innovation plans in H2, by the way, will continue and will accelerate, leveraging the new laboratory in Shanghai, which is an important opportunity for us. It is important--you asked what is changing in the various other aspects, so in the relationship with travel retail and in the managing of the overall pricing and promotions across the China consumer framework, we have dramatically improved the model or the process between the China team and the PR team in making decisions about promotionality, pricing, channel prioritization, and this is working better and better for the future.  Also about the development of local brands, for the moment they are mainly in mass. We completely acknowledge there will be a continuous development of local brands, and the strength of our innovation and the differentiation of our brands is going to be key, and so we'll continue to invest in this [indiscernible] and in the strengths. The investment in our local lab, that will develop a lot of local innovation, is part of the answer to how to compete in this evolving environment as well. Last, we are shortening the supply chain with a factory in Asia Pacific and the ability to plan more accordingly to demand, and to be more agile in responding to demand is the added big capability that will increase the flexibility, the agility of our China team in following demand.  Net, we have a strong business in China, we have strong market share, and we are determined to continue to invest for the long term in China. Yes, absolutely. Your question gives me the opportunity to give an overview of what we are trying to do. I hope you realize that the work we have done in the last several months culminates today in what we define as an inflection point. It's first of all acknowledging the need of some important changes to align to the future opportunity to address our key pressure points developed in this post-COVID environment, so I'd like to summarize first of all what we are doing, and then I will measure ourselves. The way we look at it is that, first of all, we are addressing the need to change and we are addressing the key pressure points. The first is the meaningful progress we have done on retail stocks in Asia, that as we said as of April, they should be aligned, and this will determine the ability to align in the future retail and net in this very important channel for us and for the industry in general. That's a big pressure point that we are addressing. The second, the part that was driving margin was obviously the need of gross margin, addressing our gross margin, addressing our cost structure, and right-size our organization, and so the profit recovery plan enlarged and the execution of it, which is strongly advanced, and the additional restructuring are addressing decisively our ability to recover profitability at an accelerated pace.  At the same time, this profit recovery plan is designed to resource our future growth plans more aggressively and to develop the right agility and speed to market in the organization, and we are going to measure this and to measures ourselves on that. For agility, I mean agility to allocate resources in this more volatile world more promptly and faster, as the one, for example, supply chain I just mentioned in the previous question, and the speed to market of innovation to better compete with local brands. The other important part of profitability and margin was skin care, and obviously we need to recover our skin care growth to address the profitability, as we discussed several times. I just want to clarify that the skin care growth during quarter two was very strong in the Americas, in EMEA, in APAC ex-China. In China, we didn't grow skin care during quarter two, but we grew market share of skin care, as I said before, in a very strong way.  We are addressing the skin care opportunity and the innovation of skin care that we are announcing, the one on Este\u0301e Lauder, De La Mer Fresh, De La Mer future innovation, the Clinique repositioning, [indiscernible] leveraging its heavy touch position, the The Ordinary activation and future of The Ordinary globally, all these are engines that should continue to grow also in the long term our skin care, now that [indiscernible] the retail stocks in [indiscernible] will build. That's the first big pressure point that we address.  The second was the China growth and the China focus in the long term. I believe I addressed this in my previous answer. The third one is accelerating our plan to stabilize market share in the U.S., and we are addressing this, first of all, attacking very clearly our opportunity in active derm with the Clinique heritage position and with The Ordinary's extraordinary success. We will continue to address our distribution mix improvement needs toward the consumer growth segment and the channel segment. We are accelerating our fragrance sales growth, which is very important in the region, and also would like to remind that we have the top two brands in skin care and in makeup in the region, and in skin care with the arrival and the growth of The Ordinary, now we have four of the top five skincare brands in the market and The Ordinary gained 200 points of share in the prestige market just in quarter two. We are addressing very decisively the future opportunities of this in North America. So a second point is we want to continue building on our strengths, and we said that we have strengths clearly in APAC ex-China at this moment with the comeback of Hong Kong, with a very important improvement versus the COVID period. In EMEA, we continue to have strong growth, for example in skincare and in markets in Germany, Italy, Spain, Turkey. Our emerging markets grew mid-double digits, and we believe we have a strong opportunity in emerging markets, where we have very strong market share position in every one of the top ones for the future acceleration. Our direct-to-consumer business, our freestanding stores grew double digits, supporting also our brand strength in equity, so we will continue building on all these strengths and our plans focus on this. We remain confident in the future of the prestige beauty market, so there remains very attractive--we remain focused as a pure player on these very high growth [indiscernible] market in the consumer goods industry, and finally, as I said, the profit recovery plan and the restructuring will be a key enabler of all these strategies in our future. So yes, we see that we are at an inflection point and that we are going to measure ourselves on all these elements combined, meaning we are going to measure ourselves with the pace of recovery of our profitability, with going back to a growth--sustainable growth model and investing in our brands for the future, and re-addressing the needed changes in our organization to improve agility of resource allocation and speed to market. As you know, we are working on this for some time, and the way we address it is that we are going to continue to increase the focus on high growth channels. We have done some extraordinary improvement in the specialty channel in the last year, and that will continue to be our focus. We are also obviously focusing our support to our department store partners where we have high market share, and we are managing this business carefully, and we are continuing to accelerate online with various opportunities that we have in this world, and the consumer is shopping more and more omnichannel, and so we are going to continue to put focus on the opportunity of omnichannel growth that we have in the United States. That's what we are doing, and you will see this strategy to be implemented step by step in the next 12 months, accordingly, to these opportunities. Then your question in agility, there are two measures of agility that we look at as very important. One is agility in responding to volatility faster in reallocating resources, so the action in this area has been the shortening of our supply chain in Asia, for example, and the various aspects--even the way we are repositioned. We are leveraging the historical heritage position of Clinique and doubling down on it in active derma, the way we are leveraging The Ordinary strength in active derma, so in other words how we are responding to the consumer trend of active derma now very decisively, so those are elements of agility. We want to improve our ability to do these things faster and more promptly in the future. The other aspect of the agility is the way we go to market, so reaction to, for example, the new platforms. We are learning how to operate with Tiktok globally; much more, we are focusing on earned media value much more our organization, including resource allocation but also the training and the development and the understanding of the various models. We are doing this is all markets for the world at the same time. We are modernizing our promotional models and making them more relevant to the current consumer trends, and importantly as an umbrella concept, we are becoming more and more able to react to trends. There are two kinds of trends we are working our organizational development on. The first is the long term trends, the fundamental changes in consumer preferences, where frankly we have been always pretty strong, and we are further refining these abilities. Then there are the short term trends, the trends that can change in a week, in a month of what's going to be popular online in a certain country, in a certain moment, where we have developed better and better models to react to short term trends with our brands, with our execution, with our resource allocation. And by the way, the work on organization of the profit recovery plan is also pillared to improve our ability in both these areas, meaning the agility in resource allocation and the agility in reacting to trends and to the new models of marketing around the world. Yes, and on the different retailers, the retail channels, we obviously support every one of the retail channels, so specialty multi, department store. Every retail channel is going to be supported more and more in a tailored way, meaning tailoring to their model, to their strategy, to their specific consumer profiles, and this will be very different country by country. There are countries where certain channels grow faster than others and maybe the opposite happens in other countries, so it's not about their preferences are changing, the strategy is about tailoring the strategy to each channel, supporting every one of our customers. At the end, the result of this is that the mix of our business in every country of the world will be focused on growth. It will be focused and leveraging the channels that the consumer is in that specific moment we choose, or the different target of consumer we choose in every channel, so it's about tailoring to all the opportunities wherever they are. I'd just like to add one point, is that as you said, the $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion being defined as extra profitability, which means that the reinvestment part in building our brands and accelerating growth comes from more savings than what we define as extra profit, so to be fair, there will be more savings. Some of them will be reinvested in consumer-facing growth acceleration, and the $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion is our target for extra profitability, and that's why we have been very clear on that. The investment in growth that will be done, or the extra investment in growth for the future that we want to develop capabilities for, are for consumer-facing. We are not planning to invest in many new capabilities; rather, we want to leverage the capabilities we have built in the last period in a very efficient way, so that's the way to think, I believe, about the profit recovery plan. On the unstructured market, our focus is on travelers and travelers converting, and that is getting better and better around the world, just to be clear, apart from the China situation that we have discussed many times. In the rest of the world, there is extraordinary progress in this area, double digits, in some cases triple digits in every market of the world, so this will happen more and more, also in China, also in Korea, and also in the part which has been the slowest to recover in that direction. So first part of the answer is the focus to continue growing in travelers and continuously improving the travelers' conversion. As we are seeing from the data of the market, the travelers has been improving very, very nicely, but the conversion of the travelers for the moment is below expectations. The unstructured market as such is reducing, and I want to say it's reducing also for regulations for the intentions of the government, so the retailers, so there is a trend to reduce the amount, and obviously this is also what we are doing, and so the way you should expect is that the unstructured market will be reduced, in my opinion will reduce also as a market, but will be reducing for us. It will be reducing in a gradual way as the travelers improve and increase over time."

            "name": "Tracey Travis",
            "content": "Thank you Fabrizio, and hello everyone. I'll start by reviewing our second quarter financial results, followed by a third quarter and full year outlook. I'll also provide details on our expanded profit recovery plan. As Fabrizio mentioned, our second quarter organic net sales decline of 8% met our expectations. Additionally, through tighter expense management and despite experiencing a higher tax rate due to the shift in our geographical mix of business, our earnings per share of $0.88 exceeded our initial outlook for the quarter.  From a geographic standpoint, organic net sales in our Europe, Middle East and Africa region declined 14%, mainly attributable to the persistent challenges in our Asia travel retail business. The impact from business disruptions in Israel and other parts of the Middle East accounted for a 2% reduction in the region's overall net sales growth. The markets in the region had mixed results, leading to overall flat growth across all markets. Organic net sales in our Asia-Pacific region fell 7%, reflecting continued challenges in mainland China. While our results on Douyin nearly doubled, our total online sales declined due to softer than expected performance on TMall during the 11.11 event. The overall online performance more than offset the increase in brick and mortar sales, which was led by double-digit growth in our freestanding stores. In the rest of the region, we saw strong organic net sales growth led by double-digit growth in Hong Kong SAR and Korea, as well as high single-digit growth in Japan. Our luxury fragrance brands Le Labo, Jo Malone London, and Tom Ford drove double-digit fragrance growth in the region, which was fueled by both effective commercial activations as well as compelling holiday product offerings.  Organic net sales in the Americas declined 1%, driven by a prior year benefit from changes made to MAC's take-back loyalty program in North America last year. Excluding this benefit, net sales were relatively flat in North America, reflecting growth in specialty multi and our freestanding stores and offset by softer performance experienced in department stores and online. In Latin America, organic net sales rose double digits, reflecting continued growth in nearly every market and strong performance during holiday and key shopping moments.  From a category standpoint, organic net sales fell 10% in skincare and 8% in makeup. In skincare, the ongoing challenges in Asia travel retail and mainland China drove the majority of the decrease. Organic net sales from The Ordinary and La Mer grew across every geographic region. The Ordinary saw double-digit growth in specialty multi, including ongoing expansion, and continued its focus on education-first content to drive successful social media activations. Net sales from La Mer increased both online and in brick and mortar, benefiting from captivating social media and holiday product activations. In makeup, the persistent challenges in Asia travel retail were compounded by the prior year benefit from MAC that I previously mentioned. Organic net sales fell 6% in hair care and were flat in fragrance. Net sales from La Labo grew double digits, fueled by both targeted expanded consumer reach and same store sales. The brand's ethos and high touch services persistently attract both new and loyal consumers, as evidenced by the double-digit net sales growth in our freestanding stores as well as strong performance during holiday and key shopping moments. For Jo Malone London, results from the brand's holiday collection were strong and net sales increased in nearly all channels of distribution. This growth was offset by a decline from Este\u0301e Lauder due to the timing of holiday shipments compared to last year. Our gross margin decreased 60 basis points compared to last year. The positive impacts from brand mix and net strategic pricing actions were more than offset by higher costs due to promotional items and foreign currency.  Operating expenses increased 260 basis points as a percent of sales, driven largely by the reduction in sales. Selling, advertising and promotional activities and innovation collectively accounted for 160 basis points of the increase compared to last year as we supported retail growth while also continuing to destock certain accounts in Asia travel retail. Operating income declined 25% to $577 million, and our operating margin contracted to 13.5% from 16.6% in the prior year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 37.7% compared to 24.9% last year. The increase in rate was primarily due to a true-up in the quarter to reflect the now higher estimated tax rate on our foreign operations for fiscal 2024 as a result of the change in our geographical mix of earnings. This also reflects an unfavorable impact related to previously issued share-based compensation. Diluted EPS of $0.88 decreased 43% compared to last year, including a dilutive impact of $0.19 from the change in the effective tax rate. The impact from business disruptions in Israel and other parts of the Middle East was $0.02 dilutive to EPS in the quarter. The acquisition of the Tom Ford brand was neutral to EPS as interest expense related to our debt financing was offset by the combined benefits derived as the licensor of the brand from royalty revenue this year and savings from no longer having to pay licensee royalties.  During the quarter, we generated $937 million in net cash flow from operating activities compared to $751 million last year. The increase from last year reflects lower working capital partially offset by the decline in net earnings. The favorability from working capital was largely due to the actions we have taken to reduce inventory, primarily finished goods and semi-finished goods, that resulted in a significant improvement in our days to sell. We invested $527 million in capital expenditures and we returned $474 million in cash to stockholders through dividends. Turning now to our outlook for the remainder of fiscal 2024, which excludes the impact from the remaining payment for the outstanding Decium equity anticipated to occur in May 2024 and includes Clinique's heightened focus in active derma, while we delivered on our Q2 expectations, we are lowering the high end of our fiscal '24 organic net sales outlook range to reflect continued risks from evolving macroeconomic volatility and geopolitical tensions in certain areas around the world. Despite this change to our sales outlook, we are maintaining our full year operating profitability expectation. Furthermore, we are updating our EPS outlook primarily to reflect the increase in our estimated full year effective tax rate, largely due to the anticipated geographical mix of our earnings. This is expected to more than offset the EPS benefit from foreign currency translation. Using December 29 spot rates of 1.107 for the euro, 1.273 for the pound, 7.109 for the Chinese yuan and 12.90 for the Korean yuan, currency translation is anticipated to negatively impact reported sales for the third quarter and diluted EPS for both the third quarter and the full year.  We expect organic net sales for our third quarter to increase 3% to 5% as both our businesses in Asia travel retail and in mainland China are expected to return to growth. In Asia travel retail, this growth assumes the continued reduction in retailer inventory as well as the anniversary of some business disruptions we experienced last year. Currency translation and the potential risks of further business disruptions in the Middle East are each expected to be dilutive to reported net sales by one point. We expect third quarter adjusted EPS of $0.36 to $0.46, for a decrease between 3% to 24%. Currency translation and the potential risk of further business disruptions in the Middle East are each expected to dilute EPS by $0.03. Adjusted EPS in constant currency is expected to range between an increase of 3% to a decline of 18%. For the full year, we expect reported and organic net sales to range between a decline of 1% and an increase of 1%.  Our plants have been running at reduced capacity, reflecting the pull-down of production in line with our lower shipments and to support the reduction of inventory levels both in-house and in the trade. This has resulted in inefficiencies in some of our manufacturing locations and may trigger a requirement to recognize the related manufacturing costs as in-period costs instead of when products are sold. We have reflected this potential expense and the corresponding pressure to gross margin in our outlook for the balance of the fiscal year, primarily in the third quarter. Our full year operating margin outlook remains unchanged and is expected to be between 9% and 9.5%, a contraction from 11.4% last year, and planned to partially offset the incremental pressure to gross margin through disciplined expense management. We now expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 35% compared to 26.5% last year. The increase reflects a larger mix of our expected fiscal 2024 earnings in higher tax jurisdictions as well as the unfavorable impact of previously issued share-based compensation.  Diluted EPS is expected to range between $2.08 and $2.23 before restructuring and other charges. The potential risks of further business disruptions in Israel and other parts of the Middle East and currency translation are expected to dilute earnings per share by $0.08 and $0.07 respectively. In constant currency, we expect EPS to fall between 34% to 38%. Given the progress we have made in strategic initiatives the first half of the year, we expect to return to organic net sales growth and stronger operating profitability in the second half.  In November, we announced a profit recovery plan to support the progressive rebuilding of our profit margins in fiscal years 2025 and 2026. Today with the announcement of a two-year restructuring program, we have further expanded this plan. As Fabrizio mentioned, we are focused on strategically leveraging our strengths to accelerate our return to more sustainable profitable growth while elevating our consumer activations and increasing our operating agility. The restructuring program is designed to right-size and streamline select areas within our organization, which unfortunately necessitates us making the difficult decision of an expected net reduction in positions globally of 3% to 5%.  The restructuring program is expected to begin in the third quarter and continue for the duration of the profit recovery plan. We expect to take charges of between $500 million and $700 million and generate annual gross savings of $350 million to $500 million before taxes. A portion of these savings is expected to be reinvested in consumer-facing activities to drive long term sustainable profitable growth. We now expect to drive incremental operating profit through all initiatives under the profit recovery plan of $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion, inclusive of net benefits from the restructuring program announced today. The plan is expected to yield almost all of the anticipated benefits by the end of fiscal year 2026, with slightly more than half of these benefits realized and contributing to operating profitability in fiscal 2025. In closing, we express our sincere gratitude to our teams around the world as they work tirelessly to execute against our priorities and drive our business forward. We believe that with the work that is being done to position us to return to growth in the second half of the fiscal year and beyond, and with the successful execution of our expanded profit recovery plan, we will be better positioned to return our company to long term sustainable growth and profitability. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time. Dara, I'll start with your question on the profit recovery plan. What we shared in November was our primary focus of the plan is to rebuild our gross margin, which is where we've lost, as you all know, quite a bit of margin. Some of the strategies that we spoke about at that time that we were putting in place is really to focus on more profitable channel mix, to get our inventories under control, which should improve our obsolescence as well as some of the discounting that has gone on over the last few years.  We are being more granular in terms of some of the strategic pricing initiatives that we have, and we also talked at that time about from an expense standpoint, implementing an incremental indirect procurement program to reduce some of our expense areas, so those were some of the initiatives that we spoke about that made up the $800 million to a billion in terms of the profit recovery plan at that time, and then obviously we've announced an additional element to the program with the restructuring. On China? Thanks Oliver. I'll start with the inventory levels.  You know, we've made significant progress, as we said in our prepared remarks, on inventory and bringing down the levels of inventory in the trade that were high in pockets of Asia travel retail. We are pretty comfortable that we will be able to bring those down to levels that are healthier, that are expected to drive regular replenishment levels and therefore be the net sales accelerator that we have embedded in our guidance for the second half of the year. In addition, what we spoke about is we've also, at the same time of bringing down inventory levels in the trade, brought inventory levels down in-house, and that is part of the benefit that we saw in terms of the cash improvement in the quarter, and we expect with the tools that we've invested in and having healthier levels of inventory overall, largely driven by the pull down in production that we did in the first quarter that we spoke about, that we are going to be in much better shape as we support some of the upcoming innovation that we have, as well as in the future in terms of bringing inventory levels into better control.  Obviously the investment that we've done, as Fabrizio mentioned, in our Asia supply chain allows us to have shorter lead times in the region and be able to better manage any volatility that may occur in the future, now that we have a plant and an R&D center in the region, so all of those things help us in terms of creating better inventory agility, being able to produce faster to market demand than we have been in the past. We have a pretty sophisticated, Dana, pricing model for new product launches, and I think we had spoken about it even under the profit recovery plan, making sure that our new product launches actually are accretive to our overall margin, so we have actually cut some of our new product launches that were planned for fiscal '25 in order to do that, and re-looked at our innovation pipeline to make sure that what we are launching is in fact accretive. But the sophistication that goes into our new product pricing model in terms of looking at what the competitive benchmarks are relative to that particular launch, also from a market standpoint, making sure again that the new product is positioned appropriately, we look at if it's replacing an existing franchise, measure the product and pricing differentials related to added content, added benefits, added packaging, etc., so there are a number of things that factor into it.  I think that as we mentioned, we've got some very exciting new product launches in the second half of this year. MAC is re-launching two of their largest franchises, Studio FX and the MAC lipstick. We've got Este\u0301e Lauder Re-Nutriv with SIRTIVITY that is quite exciting, really playing on the longevity focus that is accelerating in the market. Fabrizio just talked about trends - we've got quite a bit of trend-based but highly efficacious from a quality standpoint, products launching in the second half of the year, all of which have been priced appropriately for the benefits that they are contributing. That's correct. It's a great question, Steve. Look - we are certainly realistic that with regulatory changes, with what happens with inflation, there are a lot of things that we, in the base business before the profit recovery plan, need to be able to manage, and one of the things that we are working through with our organization is how do you make those choices in terms of what to invest and dis-invest in, in terms of the base business, so those are areas that we are keenly focused on as we look at just what the base progression, which you're very familiar with what our normal progression is, outside of obviously this unusual period of post-pandemic disruption that we've experienced, so. We certainly have in the past been able to do that and believe that we can do it in the future as well.  We've also stood up a very disciplined and strong project management office in order to be able to track all of the savings that we are committing to, and also obviously with the base business, making sure that we're meeting our normal base expectations as it relates to regular growth and margin expansion. Thanks Lauren, I'll start with the retail and organic. You know, when we have--especially in the second quarter, obviously when we have big events like 11.11, and you have holiday and in the case--you know, for us, when those events don't go as well as expected, obviously retailers pull back on and we pull back on some of the shipments that we have to those retailers, in order to bring things back in line, so you will see from a quarter to quarter standpoint, there may be some disconnects related to that, but it averages out over the course of a year, so we don't have any issues in any other markets like what we have been experiencing in Asia travel retail for you all to be concerned about."

For opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the floor over to Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms. Rainey Mancini. Ma'am, you may begin.\nLaraine Mancini: Hello. On today's call are Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tracey Travis, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  Since many of our remarks today contain forward-looking statements, let me refer you to our press release and our reports filed with the SEC, where you'll find factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. To facilitate the discussion of our underlying business, the commentary on our financial results and expectations is before restructuring and other charges and adjustments disclosed in our press release. Unless otherwise stated, all organic net sales growth also excludes the noncomparable impacts of acquisitions, divestitures, brand closures and the impact of foreign currency translation. You can find reconciliations between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in our press release and on the Investors section of our website.  As a reminder, references to online sales include sales that we make directly to our consumers through our brand.com sites and through third-party platforms. It also includes estimated sales of our products through our retailers' websites. [Operator Instructions]. And now I'll turn the call over to Fabrizio.\nFabrizio Freda: Thank you, Rainey, and hello to everyone. We appreciate you joining us to discuss our first quarter results, revised outlook for fiscal year 2024 and accelerated profit recovery plan to benefit fiscal year 2025 and 2026.  Before we begin, I want to start by expressing the tremendous grief and sadness we have for the victims and their families of the horrific terrorist attacks against Israel, the tragic loss of Palestinian lives and the growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Our hearts break for the profound suffering across the Middle East during this terrible time. We are committed to continuing to support the safety and well-being of all our employees in the affected areas and around the world.  Let me now turn to our first quarter results. We delivered our outlook for organic sales and exceeded the expectation for adjusted diluted EPS. Organic sales decreased 11%. Our global travel retail business drove the decline, as expected, with organic sales lower by 51% given the combination of trade inventory reduction and a structured market containment.  The entire rest of our global business rose 4% organically, led by mid- to high single-digit growth in the Americas and the markets of EMEA and double-digit growth in Asia Pacific, excluding Mainland China. The excellent performance in these regions enabled us to deliver our sales outlook despite a slower-than-expected recovery of overall prestige beauty in Mainland China.  Adjusted diluted EPS of $0.11 was ahead of the outlook as we achieved a better-than-expected adjusted operating margin. There were several drivers for this more favorable profitability, led by a greater contribution to sales from skin care than forecasted as well as disciplined expense management. Notably, we continued brand-building investments in the areas with the greatest growth opportunities with AP spending rising as a percentage of sales.  While we had a better-than-expected start of the fiscal year, we are lowering our fiscal year 2024 outlook given the further incremental external headwinds in 2 specific areas of our business. First, the expected growth rate of overall prestige beauty has slowed in Asia travel retail and Mainland China, which is currently also evidenced in the presale phase of the 11.11 Shopping Festival.  To reflect this impact as well as the ongoing policies and efforts to contain a structured market activity, we are moderating our expectation for fiscal year 2024 retail sales for Asia travel retail and Mainland China. As part of this, we continue to expect to reset retail inventory in Asia travel retail by the end of the third quarter.  Second, we are reflecting the risks of business disruption in Israel and other parts of the Middle East. For fiscal year 2024, our revised outlook continues to expect sequentially improving sales trend each quarter with double-digit organic sales growth in the second half. We also still expect sequentially stronger adjusted operating margin each quarter with continued consumer-facing investment in our growth engines.  Moreover, we are accelerating and expanding our profit recovery plan, which is designed to benefit fiscal year 2025 and 2026 for us to realize our ambitions to rebuild profitability despite the external headwinds' increased pressure on the business in fiscal year 2024.  On our earning call in August, I described our 4 strategic imperatives for fiscal year 2024, which are, drive momentum where our business is thriving, return to growth in the U.S., capture demand from the returning individual travelers in Asia travel retail, and begin to rebuild our profitability. Let me share with you our progress across these pillars as well as the framework of our accelerated and expanded profit recovery plan.  First, we are focused on extending the gains we achieved in fiscal year 2023 in the numerous developed and emerging markets around the world where we prospered. In the first quarter, we did just that. In the markets of EMEA, we achieved impressive results once more driven by the U.K. and Germany. Organic sales growth were balanced across brick-and-mortar and online as engaging activation in store and on social media resonated strongly with consumers across our brand portfolio.  We extended our prestige beauty share gains in Western Europe driven by our high-quality hero products and innovation. In EMEA's emerging market, India was a standout driven by stellar gains by The Ordinary and double-digit growth by M\u00b7A\u00b7C. In Latin America, prestige beauty remains vibrant, and we again achieved strong results. Mexico and Brazil excelled, each up double digits organically. Our localized go-to-market initiatives in these 2 dynamic emerging markets have succeeded in attracting new consumers.  We continued our winning ways in many markets across Asia Pacific. The evolution of Hong Kong's SAR is especially compelling. And we realized very strong prestige beauty share gains with our brands' strong desirability, high-touch services and innovation engaging consumer as retail traffic increasingly returns.  Our performance in Japan and Australia once again robust driven by our diversified brand portfolio catering to local desires. Around the world, our direct-to-consumer business performed especially well. Every region contributed, led by double-digit organic sales growth in freestanding stores in Asia Pacific.  On a global basis, we are thrilled that the makeup renaissance is infusing, and we have been ready to meet consumers as they again embrace their enthusiasm for the category. Makeup thrived in the quarter as the Americas, the markets in EMEA and Asia Pacific each contributed high single-digit organic sales growth to offset the pressure in the category from global travel retail.  We are successfully tapping into and creating trends with on-point innovation like M\u00b7A\u00b7C Studio Radiance Foundation and Est\u00e9e Lauder Futurist SkinTint Serum Foundation. During this exciting area for the category, our brands are leveraging their expert artists and social media know-how to engage with consumers and generate strong and expanding levels of earned media value.  Fragrance again prospered. We delivered our 11th consecutive quarter of organic sales growth led by outstanding performance in the Americas and Asia Pacific, strong share gains in prestige fragrance in Western Europe. We continue to believe that we are still in the beginning of a promising long-term phase of growth for fragrance in Asia Pacific as consumer increasingly embrace the category and penetration levels are low relatively to the West.  Indeed, in Asia Pacific, fragrance represent 8% of the prestige beauty industry, whereas in Western Europe, it is 40% of the industry. We are well positioned for this growth opportunity with our luxury and artisanal brands' alignment with the trends in the region as consumer gravitate to fragrance collections in addition to single use trends for multiple distinct scents of the highest quality.  Moving to our second pillar. We are focused on returning to growth in the U.S. for the full year and made strides in the first quarter when encouragingly, our organic sales growth improved strongly on a sequential basis and moved from a modest decline last quarter to mid-single-digit growth this quarter. Our multifaceted strategic plan included launching a robust innovation pipeline with increased focus on breakthrough ideas and leading trends, increasing engagement by brands on social media to realize greater earned media value, accentuating our strength in luxury and artisanal fragrance and in high-performance, ingredient-led and derma skin care and expanding brand reach in specialty-multi to attract new consumers.  During the first quarter, innovation proved to be a powerful catalyst for growth in the U.S. across every category. The contribution are many from Clinique, High Impact High-Fi Full Volume Mascara and M\u00b7A\u00b7C Studio Radiance Serum Powered Foundation in makeup to Est\u00e9e Lauder Advanced Night Repair Rescue Solution in skin care and more. Through these high-profile launches with sophisticated media strategies, our brands elevated their engagement on TikTok, Instagram and other platforms.  Impressively, M\u00b7A\u00b7C's earned media value in the U.S. Beauty improved several ranks to #2 in the month of September, further solidifying its #1 rank globally.  We also achieved strong progress in fragrance in the U.S. driven by our luxury and artisanal brands. Le Labo, Tom Ford and Jo Malone London each rose double digit driven by multiple growth engines from innovation to online, brick-and-mortar and expanded consumer reach.  Encouragingly, we returned to growth in skin care in the U.S. The Ordinary was a standout. Consumers continue to gravitate to the brands for its scientific, ingredient-led skin care, driving strong prestige beauty share gains. The brand launch of Soothing & Barrier Support Serum drove exceptional new consumers acquisition trends on brand.com and strategically expanded The Ordinary portfolio to include more multi-active products. Moreover, Est\u00e9e Lauder and La Mer further bolstered our improving performance in the category.  Let me now discuss the third pillar, to capture demand from the return individual travel in Asia travel retail. For the first quarter, retail sales in global travel retail were substantially ahead of our organic sales decline, which reflects the execution of our priority to reduce trade inventory in alignment with retailers. Indeed, we are making solid progress through exciting activation of our heroes, capitalizing on innovation and investing in beauty advisers.  Across these 3 pillars, one of our greatest strengths to leverage is our diverse brand portfolio, which was a fundamental driver of our progress during the first quarter. M\u00b7A\u00b7C's excellent performance showcased the strength of our portfolio among large brands, while The Ordinary drove double-digit organic sales growth among our scaling brands and Le Labo excelled, rising over 40% among the developing brands.  Let me now turn to our fourth pillar, rebuilding our profitability. We are accelerating and expanding upon our profit recovery plan. We expect to realize $800 million to $1 billion of incremental operating profit across fiscal years 2025 and 2026. The plan consists of 4 building blocks to improve each of gross margin and operating margin.  First, we are focused on optimizing mix by elevating luxury across brands, most especially in skin care and fragrance, driven by consumer preferences by expanding our direct-to-consumer ecosystem across brick-and-mortar and online.  Second, we have identified many opportunities to maximize value through better price realization and accretive innovation. Third, we intend to increasingly leverage the strategic investment we have made over the last few years, most notably our new manufacturing facility in Japan, our new China innovation labs in Shanghai and expanded online capabilities.  Lastly, we believe we can unlock meaningful cost efficiency from a combination of shorter supply chains, regionalization of our value chain and improved forecasting accuracy enabled by our new integrated business planning progress -- process across the global operation supported by advanced AI capabilities.  Before I close, I'm pleased to share that today, we will release our fiscal year 2023 social impact and sustainability report. The future advancement made possible by the extraordinary efforts of our employees around the world across our ESG areas of focus and previously stated goals. Importantly, we again achieved Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon neutrality and maintained our status of 100% renewal electricity globally for our direct operations.  The report also details that we obtained our global gender pay equity target for selected employees populations and achieved our spending targets with women- and black-owned suppliers and made strong progress toward our water withdrawal reduction and packaging targets. Today, we will also publish our second climate transition plan, which describes the effort in our ongoing climate transition journey.  In closing, in fiscal year 2024, we will remain focused on driving momentum in our markets of strength, returning to growth in the U.S., normalizing our Asia travel retail trade inventory, and expanding prestige beauty share further in Mainland China from our calendar 2-year date gains while accelerating our profit recovery plan for a robust acceleration of profitability in fiscal years 2025 and 2026.  To our employees, these are difficult times for the world and all of us. I'm grateful for what you do each and every day in caring for each other and for our beautiful company.  Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to Tracey.\nTracey Travis: Thank you, Fabrizio, and hello, everyone. Let me begin with a brief review of our first quarter results in order to devote the majority of my discussion to our revised fiscal 2024 outlook and our profit recovery plan. Our first quarter organic net sales declined 11%, and earnings per share was $0.11. From a geographic standpoint, organic net sales in the Americas increased 6%, led by mid-single-digit growth in North America and continued strength in specialty multi. In Latin America, net sales rose high single digits and was driven by continued strength in makeup as well as strong growth in both brick-and-mortar and online channels. Organic net sales in our Asia Pacific region fell 3%, primarily due to incremental headwinds from the slower-than-expected recovery of overall prestige beauty in Mainland China. There were several bright spots in the rest of the region, led by triple-digit growth in Hong Kong SAR as well as double-digit growth in Japan and Australia. Our strategic investments in brand activation and new product innovation continue to resonate well with consumers in these markets. Hong Kong SAR also benefited from increased traffic in brick-and-mortar due to fewer COVID-related restrictions compared to last year and the resumption of tourism. Organic net sales fell 27% in Europe, the Middle East and Africa due to the ongoing headwinds in our Asia travel retail business. The overall challenges in our travel retail business more than offset the performance in the rest of the region, where we saw strong growth in skin care and makeup as well as growth in most Western and emerging markets. Organic net sales growth was driven by our developed markets, led by the U.K., Germany and France. From a category perspective, fragrance continued to lead growth with organic net sales rising 5%. Strength from hero products as well as compelling innovation from Le Labo propelled double-digit increases in the Americas and in Asia Pacific. Tom Ford also contributed to growth, rising double digits in the Americas. Organic net sales rose 1% in makeup. We continue to enhance consumer engagement through strategic investments and brand campaigns, including social media activation and new product innovation. Once again, M\u00b7A\u00b7C was the overall top performer, and Too Faced, Tom Ford and Clinique all contributed to growth as well. Organic net sales declined 7% in hair care and 21% in skin care. The pressures in Asia travel retail and in Mainland China drove the decrease in skin care. The declines from Est\u00e9e Lauder and La Mer were somewhat offset by strong growth from The Ordinary. Consumer demand for the brand's hero products and new product innovation boosted its standout performance in the quarter. Our gross margin declined 440 basis points compared to last year. The benefits from the strategic pricing actions we took at the beginning of the fiscal year were more than offset by the under-absorption of overhead in our plants due primarily to the lower production of skin care products that accelerated in the second half of fiscal '23, higher obsolescence charges and an increase in promotional items, such as sets and samples, to support consumer activation. Operating expenses increased 950 basis points as a percent of sales driven largely by the reduction in sales. We maintain key investment plans in areas such as advertising and promotional activities, innovation and selling to accelerate growth where we had momentum, which collectively accounted for 480 basis points of the increase compared to last year. Operating income declined 84% to $108 million, and our operating margin contracted to 3.1% from 17% last year. Diluted EPS of $0.11 decreased 92% compared to the prior year. The impact from the cybersecurity incident we disclosed this past July was $0.08 dilutive to EPS. The acquisition of the Tom Ford brand was neutral to EPS, including interest expense related to our debt financing and reflecting savings from royalties we no longer pay as we now own the brand. During the quarter, we utilized $408 million in net cash flows from operating activities compared to $650 million last year. The decrease from last year reflects lower levels of working capital, including lower inventory levels, partially offset by lower net income. We invested $295 million in capital expenditures, and we returned $236 million in cash to stockholders through dividends. Turning now to our outlook for the second quarter and the full year. As Fabrizio mentioned, while we delivered on our Q1 expectations, we are lowering our fiscal '24 outlook for the balance of the year to reflect the slower-than-expected pace of recovery due to incremental external headwinds that continue to evolve during the second quarter. This includes the slower-than-expected growth in overall prestige beauty as well as the containment of the unstructured market activity in Asia travel retail and in Mainland China. This reduction also reflects the risks of potential business disruptions in Israel and other parts of the Middle East as well as currency headwinds. Using September 30 spot rates of for the Korean won, currency translation is anticipated to negatively impact reported sales and diluted EPS for the second quarter and for the full year.  We expect organic sales for our second quarter to decline 8% to 10%. The incremental pressures from impacting sales in our Asia travel retail business and Mainland China are expected to continue to more than offset anticipated growth in other markets globally. Currency translation and the potential risk of further business disruptions in the Middle East are each anticipated to dilute reported sales growth for the second quarter by 1 percentage point.  We expect second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.48 to $0.58 for a decline between 62% to 69%. This includes dilution of approximately $0.08 from assumed risks of potential business disruption in Israel and other parts of the Middle East and approximately $0.04 from currency translation. The increases in our full year effective tax rate and net interest expense are collectively expected to dilute EPS by $0.04. In constant currency, adjusted EPS is expected to decline between 60% and 66%. For the full year, we expect organic sales to range between a decline of 1% and an increase of 2%. Currency translation and the potential risk of further business disruptions in the Middle East are each anticipated to dilute reported sales growth for the fiscal year by 1 percentage point.  We expect full year operating margin to be between 9% and 9.5%, a contraction from 11.4% last year due to the lower sales growth level. We now expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 28%, reflecting the full year estimate of our geographical mix of earnings. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $2.17 and $2.42 before restructuring and other charges and adjustments. This includes approximately $0.22 from the potential risk of further business disruptions in the Middle East as well as approximately $0.16 from currency translation. The increases in our full year effective tax rate and interest expense are collectively expected to dilute EPS by $0.16. In constant currency, we expect EPS to fall between 25% to 33%. Given this more challenging backdrop for fiscal '24, we have advanced the development of our multiyear profit recovery plan to support our priority to progressively rebuild margin in fiscal years '25 and '26. This plan is designed to accelerate the pace at which we expect to rebuild our margins while also facilitating operational efficiencies to support go-to-market agility in our local markets. The plan initiatives will target specific areas to deliver expanded gross margin and operating profitability improvements and is initially expected to drive $800 million to $1 billion of incremental operating profit over the next 2 fiscal years. We aim to accelerate many initiatives and substantially operationalize the plan in the second half of fiscal '24 to enable the realization of a meaningful amount of the benefits beginning in fiscal '25. Our first priority is to accelerate the rebuild of our gross margin. We plan to optimize our category, product and channel mix to support profitable growth as well as focus on accretive innovation. We aim to better capitalize on our strategic pricing initiatives by reducing discounts related to excess production and continuing to exercise our pricing power ahead of inflation in our markets. Furthermore, we plan to reduce excess and obsolete inventory by enhancing our operational efficiencies and begin to leverage the investments we've made to regionalize our supply network in Asia. Our profit recovery plan will also target OpEx reductions while further investing in consumer-facing activities that are imperative to accelerating recovery and driving long-term profitable growth. Our main areas of focus include containing head count as well as reduction in costs related to indirect procurement, T&E and transportation. These are just a few examples of actions we expect to take under our profit recovery plan. We plan to share more during our second quarter earnings call in February. In closing, while we are encouraged by the strength we are seeing across our brand portfolio and recovery markets, intensifying macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility as well as weakening consumer confidence in certain markets have unfortunately slowed the pace of our anticipated recovery in isolated markets. Given these incremental challenges, we are taking actions through the advancement of our profit recovery plan to support our intention to progressively rebuild our profit margins over the next few years. We remain confident about the long-term prospects for global prestige beauty and in our corporate strategy to drive long-term sustainable profitable growth. The desirability of our brands as well as the positive momentum we are seeing across categories and in certain markets give us optimism for the future recovery in all of our markets and demonstrate the resilience of our multiple engines of growth and our ability to drive share gains globally. Our return to sales growth, combined with the profit recovery plan, which we plan to finalize and begin implementing in the second half of this year, as I said before, support the achievement of margin rebuilding and profit recovery in the next few years. I would like to extend our heartfelt appreciation to our employees around the globe for their continuing commitment and efforts to deliver our results during these challenging times. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today comes from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.\nDara Mohsenian: So apologies for a multipart question, but just had a few things on the profit recovery program. Conceptually, it sounds like it's more of a recovery from a depressed fiscal '24 base pushing even harder on some of the building blocks you outlined previously. Is that the case? Or are there more significant organizational changes that are now new in this plan to generate incremental savings? And also that $800 million to $1 billion profit recovery, should we think of that as just savings and recovery from a depressed base, and then base business top line growth on top of that could lead to greater recovery? How do we think about that? And then just, b, taking a step back, why not get even more aggressive here in terms of posture with a larger restructuring? Obviously, the external environment has changed. There's been some internal issues with supply chain and forecasting. So just thoughts on taking a more aggressive tack with the broader restructuring at some point?\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, at this point, we may be having some technical difficulties with the speaker line. So one moment while we attempt to reconnect the speaker line. [Technical Difficulty]. And ladies and gentlemen, we do have the speaker line reconnected to the conference. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Rainey for a quick statement.\nLaraine Mancini: Thank you, everyone, for your patience. We apologize for the difficulty. Fabrizio and Tracey are ready for our Q&A session now. So Jamie, if you can take us to our first question, please?\nOperator: And our first question, once again, is Dara.\nDara Mohsenian: So just wanted to start with a clarity question on the profit recovery program. It sounds like it's stemming more from a recovery versus a depressed fiscal '24 base and pushing even harder on some of the building blocks you had previously outlined. Is that the case? Or is it more of the larger organizational changes here that are new in this plan versus 3 months ago? And also, is that $800 million to $1 billion profit recovery, is that just the savings and recovery from a depressed base? Or -- and should we expect base business growth on top of that in terms of a top line rebound and the flow-through to profit? And then b, and apologize for the multipart but I want to get clarity there, just taking a step back, why not get more aggressive here with the larger restructuring? Obviously, the external environment has changed. There's been internal issues the last few quarters with supply chain and forecasting. In theory, SG&A levels have looked high ex marketing relative to peers. So just any thoughts on taking a more aggressive tack with a broader restructuring and how you guys think about that?\nTracey Travis: Thanks, Dara, for the question. And again, we do apologize for the technical difficulties. As it relates to the profit recovery plan, it is incremental to the growth that we expect from the base depressed level this year, as you indicate, Dara. So -- and we are looking at everything. Obviously, the first thing we're looking at is, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, recovering our gross profit margin. And to your point, we've had issues with high levels of inventory. We've talked for years about and you all know that we typically, because of our lead times and our historic footprint carry high levels of inventory, which does affect our agility to be able to manage when shocks happen to the system, which is what's happened over the last couple of years.  So certainly regionalizing our supply chain and completing the manufacturing facility we have in Japan will help us over the next few years in terms of being able to take more inventory out of transit and being able to produce a bit closer to demand. We also have implemented and Fabrizio talked about our integrated business planning process, which is leveraging some of the tools that we've invested in over the last few years to really improve the accuracy of our forecast, to include a bit more of the commercial drivers that drive our business in our forecast, again, to improve the accuracy and have less excess inventory. And then the actions that we're already taking this year to help improve our gross margins for next year is a significant pull-down in our production volume. So our production units this year are down about 25% from what they were last year. So even though we are anticipating now more modest growth given the update to our forecast, we are drawing down on the inventory that we have on hand as well as, obviously, some of the actions we're taking from a shipment standpoint to draw down the inventory that we have in trade in Asia travel retail. So there are a number of actions that we're taking that will help gross margin.  We are going through a SKU rationalization program in addition to cutting some of our smaller diluted innovation programs that were planned over the next year or 2. So there are lots of actions we're taking. All of those actions are not finalized yet, but many of them are in flight. They just won't impact as much this year as they will in future years. And then, yes, we are looking at our expense base and how we operate going forward, especially given our current level of sales and the lower base that we will be growing off of.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Powers from Deutsche Bank.\nStephen Powers: I guess probably, Tracey, for you as well. Just maybe you could help provide a little bit more help bridging to the implied second half revenue and profitability outlook as implied in your guidance. It's a pretty significant step up from where you will be as of the end of December based on the 2Q guide. And that's despite battling what sounds like it will be headwinds in Asia travel retail inventory that will extend into at least the third quarter. So again, maybe you can -- just the building blocks there, your level of confidence and visibility. And alongside that, it might help just if you have a view on what consumption is for your brands through this first quarter, maybe through the first half versus what you're actually shipping. Because I think a big a big part of that bridge is that you start to ship more to consumption as you get out from underneath the inventory headwinds. But again, it's a very big step up. So just some clarity and some more detail there would be great.\nTracey Travis: Yes. So no, you're exactly right. The assumption is that we ship more towards -- we're able to ship more towards the retail trends. I mean, as we said in the prepared remarks, our retail trends are ahead of our net trends in Asia travel retail, both still down because we are destocking the trade. And so the expectation is that, that will be completed by the end of the third quarter, so in the second half of the year. So part of this -- a large part of the step-up that you see in the second half of the year is our shipping more towards the retail trends that we are expecting in the second half of the year. That's a big part of it. And when you think about what happened to us and what we're anniversarying from the second half of last year, where we had the policy changes first in Korea that impacted our third and fourth quarter and then the policy change -- or policy reinforcement in Hainan, which impacted our fourth quarter. We had, in some parts of our Travel Retail business, very low shipments given those policy changes. And so we are anniversarying as well some of the initial shocks of that. Lastly, I would say that we are seeing travel come back slowly, so again, more slowly than what we anticipated. We are seeing lighter levels of conversion relative to what we saw certainly prepandemic or even pre- the significant changes in policy across the Asia region. And -- but we are seeing traffic pick up, and we are certainly expecting that, that conversion will gradually pick up as well in the second half. So those are some of the things that are underlying our second half expectations and the reason you see that big step-up in terms of volume. It's a combination of multiple factors, mostly in our Asia travel retail. A bit of it is a pickup as well in China also. Fabrizio, I don't know if there's anything you want to add.\nFabrizio Freda: No. I just want to add that the -- our retail -- underlying retail calendar year-to-date is the mid-high single digits already globally. And our estimate of retail continue to be actually improving on this point. So the retail base, which is driven by the consumption of consumers, by the innovation, by the strength of the brand, by the demand from the consumer standpoint is very solid.\nTracey Travis: For calendar year.\nFabrizio Freda: For calendar year-to-date. And as Tracey has said, the readjustment of inventories is the big things that we are dealing with. And the evolutions of the policies that have created these readjustments is what has been difficult to predict and anticipate, and it's been pretty volatile. And so that's the adjustment. But the underlying fundamentals are already strong. It's not that we need to develop them in order to deliver the retail in the future. We just to continue evolving on these fundamentals.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason English from Goldman Sachs.\nJason English: Thanks for sharing that encouraging data point on retail sales. Tracey, you're talking about how shipments weighed down last year and it's kind of following the story for last year. We've been thinking, once you get leverage back in, and once you're able to turn back on the sales, catch up of retail sales is going to give you a lot of operational leverage to aid the gross margin recovery, and that's really a sales problem. But if I objectively stop back -- step back and look at the composition of the P&L, it does tell a slightly different story. I mean it doesn't look like a revenue problem. Revenue is actually just a round trip to where you were in the first quarter of '19. It looks like it's really a cost problem. Despite revenue being back where it was in first quarter '19, COGS up $250 million, SG&A up $320 million, and this is despite cost-cut program that you announced in late 2020, which so far doesn't appear to have yielded any savings. So can you help us understand what's caused the cost to run up so much over the last couple of years? Where have the efficiency savings gone so far? And I guess you are announcing the new actions to kind of go after it. Is that enough to kind of take that back out with the initiatives you have in place?\nTracey Travis: Yes. No, great question, Jason. So if you look back to the composition of the P&L in fiscal '19, you'll see that our gross margins were higher. And certainly, our cost as a percent of sales was a bit lower. And obviously, given the pull-down that we've had in this latest guidance review, our cost as a percent of sales are higher as well. But we did have -- we've had 2 cost-saving programs. We had the Leading Beauty Forward program, and then we had the post-COVID Business Acceleration program. In both of those instances, certainly Leading Beauty Forward gave us runway. We were actually expanding operating margins by over 100 basis points a year, anywhere between 60, 80 to 100 basis points a year through that program. And that program allowed us to reinvest in capabilities that we needed, in particular to accelerate some of our digital marketing activities, to create some shared service structures in some of our functional areas and to be able to leverage cost better in those areas. So those programs -- that program was successful in both delivering margin expansion and expense leverage at the time. Advanced allowed us to close some of our underproductive brick-and-mortar doors and take a little bit of or adjustments as well. But we have, over the last few years, invested in a number of capabilities that have been needed in terms of in our regulatory area. That includes cyber, but also in the regulatory area given the increasing regulations in all of the countries that we do business with and the claims and -- that we need to support our brand marketing initiatives going forward. We've made investments in areas like our sustainability program. So we have made a number of investments that, other than the shocks that we've had over the last couple of years, have been investments that were needed in the company. Certainly, as we look forward, we are looking at, as I said before, the profit recovery program is both focused on gross margin because we're not back at the gross margin levels that we were at in fiscal '19 or even before. And we also are looking at expense areas, everything from our procurement program where we expect that we can get some savings there, to other org efficiencies. So more to come in January, February, actually when we give you our second quarter results on what the final plan will look like. But it's -- believe me, we are as focused on the P&L structure recovery as you are, Jason.\nFabrizio Freda: Yes, just I would like -- Jason, just I would like to add the point on the fact that in really the profit recovery plan needs to rebuild gross margin. And as you said, also our new capability that we invested in that Tracey mentioned also in IT in many other areas needs to align to our current sales levels. And that's the work we are going to do as well. So those are the 2 big areas of focus. And in February, we will give much more specifics and details how will affect -- will impact 2025 in the majority in 2026. And so it's a pretty clear plan. I just want to say the entire organization is aligned on this plan. We have teams already working on this. We are completely committed to deliver that. And I just want to make a clarification on the programs that we announced in 2020 because you said it didn't deliver saving. It did deliver saving in the area of selling. That was the focus.  Remember, this program was tailored a lot to the fact that the COVID had disrupted the go-to-market part of the business and then increased our sales online versus the sales in brick-and-mortar. So we need to reallocate resources more to online and less to brick-and-mortar and to create the right future in -- the future balance of cost between the 2 areas, that's what we did. In fact, we invested in the online progress. Today, we are still leveraging the benefits. And we did reduce our cost in the brick-and-mortar selling areas accordingly to the trends that COVID had created. So when we did in the past these kind of programs, we have been pretty successful in delivering what we wanted.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Olivia Tong from Raymond James.\nOlivia Tong: A bit of a multipart question and follow-up to a few. But first, just a point of clarification on the global retail number that you gave of up mid- to high single digits. What's that for you or for the category? And then on travel retail, can you give us a sense on your visibility into how much inventory is still sitting with the groups or individuals versus in a brick-and-mortar duty-free channel, which we have a little bit better clarity in?\nFabrizio Freda: Yes. Yes, it was -- it's our retail sales I was referring to. So calendar year-to-date in 2023, our trend of retail is mid-high single digit up to date. And our estimate for the future is to continue improving that trend. So my point is that retail is solid. And the negative net sales that we see in this first 6 months, for sure, our -- first, this month of the fiscal year are related to the readjustment of inventories that Tracey was mentioned. Second, on the visibility on these inventories in travel retail and -- by the way, when we say this retail, we say ex the travel retail numbers, just one clarification. So it's once the travel retail number. The point we are trying to make is that when the travel retail number, the retail and the net will be aligned, and we said they will be aligned as of the end of the third quarter. As of this moment, the retail -- the solidity of the retail progress is already in the making. That's the point we are trying to make. Anyway, on travel retail, we had a significant stock reduction in this first quarter. And we aim to be in line with the inventory expectation of retailers by the end of March. And we have visibility into these numbers. We have visibility. We have exactly the understanding for -- with each one of our retailers on where we are today, what are the programs that we are doing in order to accelerate sales retail of the existing stocks and what are the programs to obviously replenish and sell in innovation and all what we need to do in these areas. And finally, how by end March, we aim to have the retail and the net aligned. That's the program.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Filippo Falorni from Citi.\nFilippo Falorni: So I wanted to ask a question on Mainland China. It's the first quarter where you guys talked about a bit of a slowdown relative to prior quarters. So maybe, Fabrizio, can you give some context on the level of slowdown that you're seeing in the category? And then from a competitive standpoint, we've seen some local brands doing a little bit better, more on the mass side. But have you seen any trade-down within the category, both on skin care and cosmetics?\nFabrizio Freda: Yes. No. First of all, the market was growing 2% in the first quarter in China. Our retail during this quarter was flat, but our retail in China calendar year-to-date is growing, and we are building market share. But in that specific quarter, the market growth went down to 2%. Now our estimate of the recovery of the beauty market in prestige was higher than that, and that is the -- one of the key readjustments we are making in the -- in projecting the year. That's the point. And so this 2% is the current trend level. Also, as I said in my prepared remarks, the presale period of Tmall and particularly on -- in general, the Singles Day, confirms a softer trend versus a year ago, and that's why we are reflecting this confirmation. Now we are more optimistic about the next part of the Singles Day events in November, but is -- the presale was confirming a softer market. In term of your second part of the question, is the -- there are local brands in mass and in masstige, which are doing well, we start doing well in China for sure. In prestige, the impact of that is for the moment limited. And so we see prestige being solid in comparison to mass in general. And we don't see a big movement from prestige to mass at this point in time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.\nBryan Spillane: I wanted to go back to Jason English's question regarding margins. And I guess, as we kind of look forward and try to think about the rebuild to the previous margin aspirations, how much of it will -- do you expect to come from the expanded cost savings? And how much is just resetting the business mix? Because travel retail is so profitable. And so do we need travel retail to get back to kind of a similar percentage of sales as where it was 3 years ago? Or would you be able to get there if travel retail ended up being smaller for reasons given how cyclical it is?\nTracey Travis: Yes. No, it's a great question. Given where travel retail is right now, and certainly, we, I'm sure many others are thinking about the future of travel retail, which we are very encouraged by in terms of a return to growth but a return to the prior levels? Don't know. You have much now of the volume that has shifted to the local market. And I would expect to continue to see growth in the local market as well. So there may be a rebalance as it relates to the consumption for the Chinese consumer in particular as well as perhaps other consumer groups. So we're not counting on travel retail to get back to prior levels. If it does, that's great. But our profit recovery program, combined with some of the growth plans that we have for our markets and brands going forward, are not relying on that to return to profit margin -- the profit margins that we had previously.\nFabrizio Freda: And I would like to offer a bit of historical perspective on what happened during this COVID period and the volatility that this brought. I mean when you -- because you were comparing in your question versus before COVID versus the 3 years ago previous -- so take 2019. Our business in Mainland China versus 2019 is more than doubled. Our TR business today globally versus 2019 is by now, with this estimate that we are giving to you now, is actually well below. So -- but it's true that during this COVID period, the TR business, also driven by the unstructured phenomenon that we have discussed previously was actually up. But then by now, this has been reabsorbed. So the profile of the business in -- with Chinese consumers in 2019 was that there was a base sales in Mainland China. There was a lot of the sales to Chinese consumer that were happening around the world in their travel. This was estimated to be up to 40% of what was the total consumption at that time before COVID. And this -- a lot of this was in travel retail and also was in the cities that were visited like, I don't know, London, Paris, New York, Hong Kong, Tokyo, et cetera. So now during COVID, obviously, the frontier were all closed. So this consumption came back into Mainland China. In fact, our business in Mainland China today, as I said, has doubled the world was. And some of it went into travel retail, like Hainan development and all the other things that happened, which are very good for the long term. And some of it went into the unstructured business, which is actually going down now and is part of the readjustment. And these are positive things for the long term. And so the resulting -- the result of all these movements is frankly solid and sustainable for the long term because the results is a solid business in Mainland China, which we are supporting and will continue to support. We have built an R&D center. We have created all the abilities to be more locally relevant in the future and to continue to support this business and invest in this business and invest in this very important market for us in the long term that we believe is core to -- also to our future growth algorithm. At the same time, the amount of volatile business that went into the TR in the period of COVID has been derisked and is going down. And as we said, we need to continue to derisk it in this fiscal year. And that's what we are planning and that's what we are announcing in term of the resulting guidance of that. And the travel business, meaning the regular travelers and Chinese consumer that are traveling the world, this is gradually going up again and so will create good consumption by regular travelers. In this moment, it's going up more in Asia than in the West. The travel into the West is still relatively limited, but we forecast this over time to continue to improve. And the lending place of these movements will be the sustainable profitable business that we are coming back to.\nBryan Spillane: Okay. So to be clear, we can get back to kind of the previous profit algorithm even if travel retail and basically Hainan is not as big as it was previously?\nFabrizio Freda: Yes, we believe so.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, with that, we've reached the end of today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Fabrizio for any closing remarks.\nFabrizio Freda: Thank you. And I just wanted to try to summarize this enormous moving part and make sure that we give you the clarity of what we are focused on at this point in this moment. So we expect calendar year 2023 to be the final, and frankly painful, post-COVID reset period for the company. We move forward with confidence as our fundamentals are strong in this attractive prestige beauty industry. Our calendar year-to-date retail sales performance remain very solid in all recovery markets and in general, both developed and emerging in the mid-single high digit that I quoted before.  Our brand portfolio is better than ever with the recent acquisition of Tom Ford, solidifying our luxury strategy and The Ordinary, which we didn't talk a lot in this call but is becoming a powerhouse brand at the entry of growing active derma segment and is definitely our fastest-growing brand in our portfolio. Our innovation pipeline is robust for fiscal year 2024, but it gets even better and bigger and stronger in fiscal year 2025 with the expansion into the white space opportunity that we have identified.  We are on track to align retail and net sales via inventory reduction with our retailers in China private retail, as discussed during the call. We are focused on accelerating a more balanced growth in the future by market, by channel. And importantly, via the profit recovery plan, we are preparing to rebuild gross margin, leverage our new capabilities to align our expenses to our current sales level and further strengthen our consumer-facing activities. And we have the strategic focus and the talent to do this work, and together, intend to return to our historical cadence of delivering sustainable sales and profit growth. And thank you for your time and for your attention today.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, with that, we'll conclude today's conference call and presentation. We thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Fabrizio Freda",
            "content": "Thank you, Rainey, and hello to everyone. We appreciate you joining us to discuss our first quarter results, revised outlook for fiscal year 2024 and accelerated profit recovery plan to benefit fiscal year 2025 and 2026.  Before we begin, I want to start by expressing the tremendous grief and sadness we have for the victims and their families of the horrific terrorist attacks against Israel, the tragic loss of Palestinian lives and the growing humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Our hearts break for the profound suffering across the Middle East during this terrible time. We are committed to continuing to support the safety and well-being of all our employees in the affected areas and around the world.  Let me now turn to our first quarter results. We delivered our outlook for organic sales and exceeded the expectation for adjusted diluted EPS. Organic sales decreased 11%. Our global travel retail business drove the decline, as expected, with organic sales lower by 51% given the combination of trade inventory reduction and a structured market containment.  The entire rest of our global business rose 4% organically, led by mid- to high single-digit growth in the Americas and the markets of EMEA and double-digit growth in Asia Pacific, excluding Mainland China. The excellent performance in these regions enabled us to deliver our sales outlook despite a slower-than-expected recovery of overall prestige beauty in Mainland China.  Adjusted diluted EPS of $0.11 was ahead of the outlook as we achieved a better-than-expected adjusted operating margin. There were several drivers for this more favorable profitability, led by a greater contribution to sales from skin care than forecasted as well as disciplined expense management. Notably, we continued brand-building investments in the areas with the greatest growth opportunities with AP spending rising as a percentage of sales.  While we had a better-than-expected start of the fiscal year, we are lowering our fiscal year 2024 outlook given the further incremental external headwinds in 2 specific areas of our business. First, the expected growth rate of overall prestige beauty has slowed in Asia travel retail and Mainland China, which is currently also evidenced in the presale phase of the 11.11 Shopping Festival.  To reflect this impact as well as the ongoing policies and efforts to contain a structured market activity, we are moderating our expectation for fiscal year 2024 retail sales for Asia travel retail and Mainland China. As part of this, we continue to expect to reset retail inventory in Asia travel retail by the end of the third quarter.  Second, we are reflecting the risks of business disruption in Israel and other parts of the Middle East. For fiscal year 2024, our revised outlook continues to expect sequentially improving sales trend each quarter with double-digit organic sales growth in the second half. We also still expect sequentially stronger adjusted operating margin each quarter with continued consumer-facing investment in our growth engines.  Moreover, we are accelerating and expanding our profit recovery plan, which is designed to benefit fiscal year 2025 and 2026 for us to realize our ambitions to rebuild profitability despite the external headwinds' increased pressure on the business in fiscal year 2024.  On our earning call in August, I described our 4 strategic imperatives for fiscal year 2024, which are, drive momentum where our business is thriving, return to growth in the U.S., capture demand from the returning individual travelers in Asia travel retail, and begin to rebuild our profitability. Let me share with you our progress across these pillars as well as the framework of our accelerated and expanded profit recovery plan.  First, we are focused on extending the gains we achieved in fiscal year 2023 in the numerous developed and emerging markets around the world where we prospered. In the first quarter, we did just that. In the markets of EMEA, we achieved impressive results once more driven by the U.K. and Germany. Organic sales growth were balanced across brick-and-mortar and online as engaging activation in store and on social media resonated strongly with consumers across our brand portfolio.  We extended our prestige beauty share gains in Western Europe driven by our high-quality hero products and innovation. In EMEA's emerging market, India was a standout driven by stellar gains by The Ordinary and double-digit growth by M\u00b7A\u00b7C. In Latin America, prestige beauty remains vibrant, and we again achieved strong results. Mexico and Brazil excelled, each up double digits organically. Our localized go-to-market initiatives in these 2 dynamic emerging markets have succeeded in attracting new consumers.  We continued our winning ways in many markets across Asia Pacific. The evolution of Hong Kong's SAR is especially compelling. And we realized very strong prestige beauty share gains with our brands' strong desirability, high-touch services and innovation engaging consumer as retail traffic increasingly returns.  Our performance in Japan and Australia once again robust driven by our diversified brand portfolio catering to local desires. Around the world, our direct-to-consumer business performed especially well. Every region contributed, led by double-digit organic sales growth in freestanding stores in Asia Pacific.  On a global basis, we are thrilled that the makeup renaissance is infusing, and we have been ready to meet consumers as they again embrace their enthusiasm for the category. Makeup thrived in the quarter as the Americas, the markets in EMEA and Asia Pacific each contributed high single-digit organic sales growth to offset the pressure in the category from global travel retail.  We are successfully tapping into and creating trends with on-point innovation like M\u00b7A\u00b7C Studio Radiance Foundation and Este\u0301e Lauder Futurist SkinTint Serum Foundation. During this exciting area for the category, our brands are leveraging their expert artists and social media know-how to engage with consumers and generate strong and expanding levels of earned media value.  Fragrance again prospered. We delivered our 11th consecutive quarter of organic sales growth led by outstanding performance in the Americas and Asia Pacific, strong share gains in prestige fragrance in Western Europe. We continue to believe that we are still in the beginning of a promising long-term phase of growth for fragrance in Asia Pacific as consumer increasingly embrace the category and penetration levels are low relatively to the West.  Indeed, in Asia Pacific, fragrance represent 8% of the prestige beauty industry, whereas in Western Europe, it is 40% of the industry. We are well positioned for this growth opportunity with our luxury and artisanal brands' alignment with the trends in the region as consumer gravitate to fragrance collections in addition to single use trends for multiple distinct scents of the highest quality.  Moving to our second pillar. We are focused on returning to growth in the U.S. for the full year and made strides in the first quarter when encouragingly, our organic sales growth improved strongly on a sequential basis and moved from a modest decline last quarter to mid-single-digit growth this quarter. Our multifaceted strategic plan included launching a robust innovation pipeline with increased focus on breakthrough ideas and leading trends, increasing engagement by brands on social media to realize greater earned media value, accentuating our strength in luxury and artisanal fragrance and in high-performance, ingredient-led and derma skin care and expanding brand reach in specialty-multi to attract new consumers.  During the first quarter, innovation proved to be a powerful catalyst for growth in the U.S. across every category. The contribution are many from Clinique, High Impact High-Fi Full Volume Mascara and M\u00b7A\u00b7C Studio Radiance Serum Powered Foundation in makeup to Este\u0301e Lauder Advanced Night Repair Rescue Solution in skin care and more. Through these high-profile launches with sophisticated media strategies, our brands elevated their engagement on TikTok, Instagram and other platforms.  Impressively, M\u00b7A\u00b7C's earned media value in the U.S. Beauty improved several ranks to #2 in the month of September, further solidifying its #1 rank globally.  We also achieved strong progress in fragrance in the U.S. driven by our luxury and artisanal brands. Le Labo, Tom Ford and Jo Malone London each rose double digit driven by multiple growth engines from innovation to online, brick-and-mortar and expanded consumer reach.  Encouragingly, we returned to growth in skin care in the U.S. The Ordinary was a standout. Consumers continue to gravitate to the brands for its scientific, ingredient-led skin care, driving strong prestige beauty share gains. The brand launch of Soothing & Barrier Support Serum drove exceptional new consumers acquisition trends on brand.com and strategically expanded The Ordinary portfolio to include more multi-active products. Moreover, Este\u0301e Lauder and La Mer further bolstered our improving performance in the category.  Let me now discuss the third pillar, to capture demand from the return individual travel in Asia travel retail. For the first quarter, retail sales in global travel retail were substantially ahead of our organic sales decline, which reflects the execution of our priority to reduce trade inventory in alignment with retailers. Indeed, we are making solid progress through exciting activation of our heroes, capitalizing on innovation and investing in beauty advisers.  Across these 3 pillars, one of our greatest strengths to leverage is our diverse brand portfolio, which was a fundamental driver of our progress during the first quarter. M\u00b7A\u00b7C's excellent performance showcased the strength of our portfolio among large brands, while The Ordinary drove double-digit organic sales growth among our scaling brands and Le Labo excelled, rising over 40% among the developing brands.  Let me now turn to our fourth pillar, rebuilding our profitability. We are accelerating and expanding upon our profit recovery plan. We expect to realize $800 million to $1 billion of incremental operating profit across fiscal years 2025 and 2026. The plan consists of 4 building blocks to improve each of gross margin and operating margin.  First, we are focused on optimizing mix by elevating luxury across brands, most especially in skin care and fragrance, driven by consumer preferences by expanding our direct-to-consumer ecosystem across brick-and-mortar and online.  Second, we have identified many opportunities to maximize value through better price realization and accretive innovation. Third, we intend to increasingly leverage the strategic investment we have made over the last few years, most notably our new manufacturing facility in Japan, our new China innovation labs in Shanghai and expanded online capabilities.  Lastly, we believe we can unlock meaningful cost efficiency from a combination of shorter supply chains, regionalization of our value chain and improved forecasting accuracy enabled by our new integrated business planning progress -- process across the global operation supported by advanced AI capabilities.  Before I close, I'm pleased to share that today, we will release our fiscal year 2023 social impact and sustainability report. The future advancement made possible by the extraordinary efforts of our employees around the world across our ESG areas of focus and previously stated goals. Importantly, we again achieved Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon neutrality and maintained our status of 100% renewal electricity globally for our direct operations.  The report also details that we obtained our global gender pay equity target for selected employees populations and achieved our spending targets with women- and black-owned suppliers and made strong progress toward our water withdrawal reduction and packaging targets. Today, we will also publish our second climate transition plan, which describes the effort in our ongoing climate transition journey.  In closing, in fiscal year 2024, we will remain focused on driving momentum in our markets of strength, returning to growth in the U.S., normalizing our Asia travel retail trade inventory, and expanding prestige beauty share further in Mainland China from our calendar 2-year date gains while accelerating our profit recovery plan for a robust acceleration of profitability in fiscal years 2025 and 2026.  To our employees, these are difficult times for the world and all of us. I'm grateful for what you do each and every day in caring for each other and for our beautiful company.  Thank you. And I will now turn the call over to Tracey. No. I just want to add that the -- our retail -- underlying retail calendar year-to-date is the mid-high single digits already globally. And our estimate of retail continue to be actually improving on this point. So the retail base, which is driven by the consumption of consumers, by the innovation, by the strength of the brand, by the demand from the consumer standpoint is very solid. For calendar year-to-date. And as Tracey has said, the readjustment of inventories is the big things that we are dealing with. And the evolutions of the policies that have created these readjustments is what has been difficult to predict and anticipate, and it's been pretty volatile. And so that's the adjustment. But the underlying fundamentals are already strong. It's not that we need to develop them in order to deliver the retail in the future. We just to continue evolving on these fundamentals. Yes, just I would like -- Jason, just I would like to add the point on the fact that in really the profit recovery plan needs to rebuild gross margin. And as you said, also our new capability that we invested in that Tracey mentioned also in IT in many other areas needs to align to our current sales levels. And that's the work we are going to do as well. So those are the 2 big areas of focus. And in February, we will give much more specifics and details how will affect -- will impact 2025 in the majority in 2026. And so it's a pretty clear plan. I just want to say the entire organization is aligned on this plan. We have teams already working on this. We are completely committed to deliver that. And I just want to make a clarification on the programs that we announced in 2020 because you said it didn't deliver saving. It did deliver saving in the area of selling. That was the focus.  Remember, this program was tailored a lot to the fact that the COVID had disrupted the go-to-market part of the business and then increased our sales online versus the sales in brick-and-mortar. So we need to reallocate resources more to online and less to brick-and-mortar and to create the right future in -- the future balance of cost between the 2 areas, that's what we did. In fact, we invested in the online progress. Today, we are still leveraging the benefits. And we did reduce our cost in the brick-and-mortar selling areas accordingly to the trends that COVID had created. So when we did in the past these kind of programs, we have been pretty successful in delivering what we wanted. Yes. Yes, it was -- it's our retail sales I was referring to. So calendar year-to-date in 2023, our trend of retail is mid-high single digit up to date. And our estimate for the future is to continue improving that trend. So my point is that retail is solid. And the negative net sales that we see in this first 6 months, for sure, our -- first, this month of the fiscal year are related to the readjustment of inventories that Tracey was mentioned. Second, on the visibility on these inventories in travel retail and -- by the way, when we say this retail, we say ex the travel retail numbers, just one clarification. So it's once the travel retail number. The point we are trying to make is that when the travel retail number, the retail and the net will be aligned, and we said they will be aligned as of the end of the third quarter. As of this moment, the retail -- the solidity of the retail progress is already in the making. That's the point we are trying to make. Anyway, on travel retail, we had a significant stock reduction in this first quarter. And we aim to be in line with the inventory expectation of retailers by the end of March. And we have visibility into these numbers. We have visibility. We have exactly the understanding for -- with each one of our retailers on where we are today, what are the programs that we are doing in order to accelerate sales retail of the existing stocks and what are the programs to obviously replenish and sell in innovation and all what we need to do in these areas. And finally, how by end March, we aim to have the retail and the net aligned. That's the program. Yes. No. First of all, the market was growing 2% in the first quarter in China. Our retail during this quarter was flat, but our retail in China calendar year-to-date is growing, and we are building market share. But in that specific quarter, the market growth went down to 2%. Now our estimate of the recovery of the beauty market in prestige was higher than that, and that is the -- one of the key readjustments we are making in the -- in projecting the year. That's the point. And so this 2% is the current trend level. Also, as I said in my prepared remarks, the presale period of Tmall and particularly on -- in general, the Singles Day, confirms a softer trend versus a year ago, and that's why we are reflecting this confirmation. Now we are more optimistic about the next part of the Singles Day events in November, but is -- the presale was confirming a softer market. In term of your second part of the question, is the -- there are local brands in mass and in masstige, which are doing well, we start doing well in China for sure. In prestige, the impact of that is for the moment limited. And so we see prestige being solid in comparison to mass in general. And we don't see a big movement from prestige to mass at this point in time. And I would like to offer a bit of historical perspective on what happened during this COVID period and the volatility that this brought. I mean when you -- because you were comparing in your question versus before COVID versus the 3 years ago previous -- so take 2019. Our business in Mainland China versus 2019 is more than doubled. Our TR business today globally versus 2019 is by now, with this estimate that we are giving to you now, is actually well below. So -- but it's true that during this COVID period, the TR business, also driven by the unstructured phenomenon that we have discussed previously was actually up.

And so the resulting -- the result of all these movements is frankly solid and sustainable for the long term because the results is a solid business in Mainland China, which we are supporting and will continue to support. We have built an R&D center. We have created all the abilities to be more locally relevant in the future and to continue to support this business and invest in this business and invest in this very important market for us in the long term that we believe is core to -- also to our future growth algorithm.

And as we said, we need to continue to derisk it in this fiscal year. And that's what we are planning and that's what we are announcing in term of the resulting guidance of that. And the travel business, meaning the regular travelers and Chinese consumer that are traveling the world, this is gradually going up again and so will create good consumption by regular travelers. In this moment, it's going up more in Asia than in the West. The travel into the West is still relatively limited, but we forecast this over time to continue to improve. And the lending place of these movements will be the sustainable profitable business that we are coming back to. Yes, we believe so. Thank you. And I just wanted to try to summarize this enormous moving part and make sure that we give you the clarity of what we are focused on at this point in this moment. So we expect calendar year 2023 to be the final, and frankly painful, post-COVID reset period for the company. We move forward with confidence as our fundamentals are strong in this attractive prestige beauty industry. Our calendar year-to-date retail sales performance remain very solid in all recovery markets and in general, both developed and emerging in the mid-single high digit that I quoted before.  Our brand portfolio is better than ever with the recent acquisition of Tom Ford, solidifying our luxury strategy and The Ordinary, which we didn't talk a lot in this call but is becoming a powerhouse brand at the entry of growing active derma segment and is definitely our fastest-growing brand in our portfolio. Our innovation pipeline is robust for fiscal year 2024, but it gets even better and bigger and stronger in fiscal year 2025 with the expansion into the white space opportunity that we have identified.  We are on track to align retail and net sales via inventory reduction with our retailers in China private retail, as discussed during the call. We are focused on accelerating a more balanced growth in the future by market, by channel. And importantly, via the profit recovery plan, we are preparing to rebuild gross margin, leverage our new capabilities to align our expenses to our current sales level and further strengthen our consumer-facing activities. And we have the strategic focus and the talent to do this work, and together, intend to return to our historical cadence of delivering sustainable sales and profit growth. And thank you for your time and for your attention today."

            "name": "Tracey Travis",
            "content": "Thank you, Fabrizio, and hello, everyone. Let me begin with a brief review of our first quarter results in order to devote the majority of my discussion to our revised fiscal 2024 outlook and our profit recovery plan. Our first quarter organic net sales declined 11%, and earnings per share was $0.11. From a geographic standpoint, organic net sales in the Americas increased 6%, led by mid-single-digit growth in North America and continued strength in specialty multi. In Latin America, net sales rose high single digits and was driven by continued strength in makeup as well as strong growth in both brick-and-mortar and online channels. Organic net sales in our Asia Pacific region fell 3%, primarily due to incremental headwinds from the slower-than-expected recovery of overall prestige beauty in Mainland China. There were several bright spots in the rest of the region, led by triple-digit growth in Hong Kong SAR as well as double-digit growth in Japan and Australia. Our strategic investments in brand activation and new product innovation continue to resonate well with consumers in these markets. Hong Kong SAR also benefited from increased traffic in brick-and-mortar due to fewer COVID-related restrictions compared to last year and the resumption of tourism. Organic net sales fell 27% in Europe, the Middle East and Africa due to the ongoing headwinds in our Asia travel retail business. The overall challenges in our travel retail business more than offset the performance in the rest of the region, where we saw strong growth in skin care and makeup as well as growth in most Western and emerging markets. Organic net sales growth was driven by our developed markets, led by the U.K., Germany and France. From a category perspective, fragrance continued to lead growth with organic net sales rising 5%. Strength from hero products as well as compelling innovation from Le Labo propelled double-digit increases in the Americas and in Asia Pacific. Tom Ford also contributed to growth, rising double digits in the Americas. Organic net sales rose 1% in makeup. We continue to enhance consumer engagement through strategic investments and brand campaigns, including social media activation and new product innovation. Once again, M\u00b7A\u00b7C was the overall top performer, and Too Faced, Tom Ford and Clinique all contributed to growth as well. Organic net sales declined 7% in hair care and 21% in skin care. The pressures in Asia travel retail and in Mainland China drove the decrease in skin care. The declines from Este\u0301e Lauder and La Mer were somewhat offset by strong growth from The Ordinary. Consumer demand for the brand's hero products and new product innovation boosted its standout performance in the quarter. Our gross margin declined 440 basis points compared to last year. The benefits from the strategic pricing actions we took at the beginning of the fiscal year were more than offset by the under-absorption of overhead in our plants due primarily to the lower production of skin care products that accelerated in the second half of fiscal '23, higher obsolescence charges and an increase in promotional items, such as sets and samples, to support consumer activation. Operating expenses increased 950 basis points as a percent of sales driven largely by the reduction in sales. We maintain key investment plans in areas such as advertising and promotional activities, innovation and selling to accelerate growth where we had momentum, which collectively accounted for 480 basis points of the increase compared to last year. Operating income declined 84% to $108 million, and our operating margin contracted to 3.1% from 17% last year. Diluted EPS of $0.11 decreased 92% compared to the prior year. The impact from the cybersecurity incident we disclosed this past July was $0.08 dilutive to EPS. The acquisition of the Tom Ford brand was neutral to EPS, including interest expense related to our debt financing and reflecting savings from royalties we no longer pay as we now own the brand. During the quarter, we utilized $408 million in net cash flows from operating activities compared to $650 million last year. The decrease from last year reflects lower levels of working capital, including lower inventory levels, partially offset by lower net income. We invested $295 million in capital expenditures, and we returned $236 million in cash to stockholders through dividends. Turning now to our outlook for the second quarter and the full year. As Fabrizio mentioned, while we delivered on our Q1 expectations, we are lowering our fiscal '24 outlook for the balance of the year to reflect the slower-than-expected pace of recovery due to incremental external headwinds that continue to evolve during the second quarter. This includes the slower-than-expected growth in overall prestige beauty as well as the containment of the unstructured market activity in Asia travel retail and in Mainland China. This reduction also reflects the risks of potential business disruptions in Israel and other parts of the Middle East as well as currency headwinds. Using September 30 spot rates of for the Korean won, currency translation is anticipated to negatively impact reported sales and diluted EPS for the second quarter and for the full year.  We expect organic sales for our second quarter to decline 8% to 10%. The incremental pressures from impacting sales in our Asia travel retail business and Mainland China are expected to continue to more than offset anticipated growth in other markets globally. Currency translation and the potential risk of further business disruptions in the Middle East are each anticipated to dilute reported sales growth for the second quarter by 1 percentage point.  We expect second quarter adjusted EPS of $0.48 to $0.58 for a decline between 62% to 69%. This includes dilution of approximately $0.08 from assumed risks of potential business disruption in Israel and other parts of the Middle East and approximately $0.04 from currency translation. The increases in our full year effective tax rate and net interest expense are collectively expected to dilute EPS by $0.04. In constant currency, adjusted EPS is expected to decline between 60% and 66%. For the full year, we expect organic sales to range between a decline of 1% and an increase of 2%. Currency translation and the potential risk of further business disruptions in the Middle East are each anticipated to dilute reported sales growth for the fiscal year by 1 percentage point.  We expect full year operating margin to be between 9% and 9.5%, a contraction from 11.4% last year due to the lower sales growth level. We now expect our full year effective tax rate to be approximately 28%, reflecting the full year estimate of our geographical mix of earnings. Diluted EPS is expected to range between $2.17 and $2.42 before restructuring and other charges and adjustments. This includes approximately $0.22 from the potential risk of further business disruptions in the Middle East as well as approximately $0.16 from currency translation. The increases in our full year effective tax rate and interest expense are collectively expected to dilute EPS by $0.16. In constant currency, we expect EPS to fall between 25% to 33%. Given this more challenging backdrop for fiscal '24, we have advanced the development of our multiyear profit recovery plan to support our priority to progressively rebuild margin in fiscal years '25 and '26. This plan is designed to accelerate the pace at which we expect to rebuild our margins while also facilitating operational efficiencies to support go-to-market agility in our local markets. The plan initiatives will target specific areas to deliver expanded gross margin and operating profitability improvements and is initially expected to drive $800 million to $1 billion of incremental operating profit over the next 2 fiscal years. We aim to accelerate many initiatives and substantially operationalize the plan in the second half of fiscal '24 to enable the realization of a meaningful amount of the benefits beginning in fiscal '25. Our first priority is to accelerate the rebuild of our gross margin. We plan to optimize our category, product and channel mix to support profitable growth as well as focus on accretive innovation. We aim to better capitalize on our strategic pricing initiatives by reducing discounts related to excess production and continuing to exercise our pricing power ahead of inflation in our markets. Furthermore, we plan to reduce excess and obsolete inventory by enhancing our operational efficiencies and begin to leverage the investments we've made to regionalize our supply network in Asia. Our profit recovery plan will also target OpEx reductions while further investing in consumer-facing activities that are imperative to accelerating recovery and driving long-term profitable growth. Our main areas of focus include containing head count as well as reduction in costs related to indirect procurement, T&E and transportation. These are just a few examples of actions we expect to take under our profit recovery plan. We plan to share more during our second quarter earnings call in February. In closing, while we are encouraged by the strength we are seeing across our brand portfolio and recovery markets, intensifying macroeconomic and geopolitical volatility as well as weakening consumer confidence in certain markets have unfortunately slowed the pace of our anticipated recovery in isolated markets. Given these incremental challenges, we are taking actions through the advancement of our profit recovery plan to support our intention to progressively rebuild our profit margins over the next few years. We remain confident about the long-term prospects for global prestige beauty and in our corporate strategy to drive long-term sustainable profitable growth. The desirability of our brands as well as the positive momentum we are seeing across categories and in certain markets give us optimism for the future recovery in all of our markets and demonstrate the resilience of our multiple engines of growth and our ability to drive share gains globally. Our return to sales growth, combined with the profit recovery plan, which we plan to finalize and begin implementing in the second half of this year, as I said before, support the achievement of margin rebuilding and profit recovery in the next few years. I would like to extend our heartfelt appreciation to our employees around the globe for their continuing commitment and efforts to deliver our results during these challenging times. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll be happy to take your questions at this time. Thanks, Dara, for the question. And again, we do apologize for the technical difficulties. As it relates to the profit recovery plan, it is incremental to the growth that we expect from the base depressed level this year, as you indicate, Dara. So -- and we are looking at everything. Obviously, the first thing we're looking at is, as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, recovering our gross profit margin. And to your point, we've had issues with high levels of inventory. We've talked for years about and you all know that we typically, because of our lead times and our historic footprint carry high levels of inventory, which does affect our agility to be able to manage when shocks happen to the system, which is what's happened over the last couple of years.  So certainly regionalizing our supply chain and completing the manufacturing facility we have in Japan will help us over the next few years in terms of being able to take more inventory out of transit and being able to produce a bit closer to demand. We also have implemented and Fabrizio talked about our integrated business planning process, which is leveraging some of the tools that we've invested in over the last few years to really improve the accuracy of our forecast, to include a bit more of the commercial drivers that drive our business in our forecast, again, to improve the accuracy and have less excess inventory. And then the actions that we're already taking this year to help improve our gross margins for next year is a significant pull-down in our production volume. So our production units this year are down about 25% from what they were last year. So even though we are anticipating now more modest growth given the update to our forecast, we are drawing down on the inventory that we have on hand as well as, obviously, some of the actions we're taking from a shipment standpoint to draw down the inventory that we have in trade in Asia travel retail. So there are a number of actions that we're taking that will help gross margin.  We are going through a SKU rationalization program in addition to cutting some of our smaller diluted innovation programs that were planned over the next year or 2. So there are lots of actions we're taking. All of those actions are not finalized yet, but many of them are in flight. They just won't impact as much this year as they will in future years. And then, yes, we are looking at our expense base and how we operate going forward, especially given our current level of sales and the lower base that we will be growing off of. Yes. So no, you're exactly right. The assumption is that we ship more towards -- we're able to ship more towards the retail trends. I mean, as we said in the prepared remarks, our retail trends are ahead of our net trends in Asia travel retail, both still down because we are destocking the trade. And so the expectation is that, that will be completed by the end of the third quarter, so in the second half of the year. So part of this -- a large part of the step-up that you see in the second half of the year is our shipping more towards the retail trends that we are expecting in the second half of the year. That's a big part of it. And when you think about what happened to us and what we're anniversarying from the second half of last year, where we had the policy changes first in Korea that impacted our third and fourth quarter and then the policy change -- or policy reinforcement in Hainan, which impacted our fourth quarter. We had, in some parts of our Travel Retail business, very low shipments given those policy changes. And so we are anniversarying as well some of the initial shocks of that. Lastly, I would say that we are seeing travel come back slowly, so again, more slowly than what we anticipated. We are seeing lighter levels of conversion relative to what we saw certainly prepandemic or even pre- the significant changes in policy across the Asia region. And -- but we are seeing traffic pick up, and we are certainly expecting that, that conversion will gradually pick up as well in the second half. So those are some of the things that are underlying our second half expectations and the reason you see that big step-up in terms of volume. It's a combination of multiple factors, mostly in our Asia travel retail. A bit of it is a pickup as well in China also. Fabrizio, I don't know if there's anything you want to add. For calendar year. Yes. No, great question, Jason. So if you look back to the composition of the P&L in fiscal '19, you'll see that our gross margins were higher. And certainly, our cost as a percent of sales was a bit lower. And obviously, given the pull-down that we've had in this latest guidance review, our cost as a percent of sales are higher as well. But we did have -- we've had 2 cost-saving programs. We had the Leading Beauty Forward program, and then we had the post-COVID Business Acceleration program. In both of those instances, certainly Leading Beauty Forward gave us runway. We were actually expanding operating margins by over 100 basis points a year, anywhere between 60, 80 to 100 basis points a year through that program. And that program allowed us to reinvest in capabilities that we needed, in particular to accelerate some of our digital marketing activities, to create some shared service structures in some of our functional areas and to be able to leverage cost better in those areas. So those programs -- that program was successful in both delivering margin expansion and expense leverage at the time. Advanced allowed us to close some of our underproductive brick-and-mortar doors and take a little bit of or adjustments as well. But we have, over the last few years, invested in a number of capabilities that have been needed in terms of in our regulatory area. That includes cyber, but also in the regulatory area given the increasing regulations in all of the countries that we do business with and the claims and -- that we need to support our brand marketing initiatives going forward. We've made investments in areas like our sustainability program. So we have made a number of investments that, other than the shocks that we've had over the last couple of years, have been investments that were needed in the company. Certainly, as we look forward, we are looking at, as I said before, the profit recovery program is both focused on gross margin because we're not back at the gross margin levels that we were at in fiscal '19 or even before. And we also are looking at expense areas, everything from our procurement program where we expect that we can get some savings there, to other org efficiencies. So more to come in January, February, actually when we give you our second quarter results on what the final plan will look like. But it's -- believe me, we are as focused on the P&L structure recovery as you are, Jason. Yes. No, it's a great question. Given where travel retail is right now, and certainly, we, I'm sure many others are thinking about the future of travel retail, which we are very encouraged by in terms of a return to growth but a return to the prior levels? Don't know. You have much now of the volume that has shifted to the local market. And I would expect to continue to see growth in the local market as well. So there may be a rebalance as it relates to the consumption for the Chinese consumer in particular as well as perhaps other consumer groups. So we're not counting on travel retail to get back to prior levels. If it does, that's great. But our profit recovery program, combined with some of the growth plans that we have for our markets and brands going forward, are not relying on that to return to profit margin -- the profit margins that we had previously."
